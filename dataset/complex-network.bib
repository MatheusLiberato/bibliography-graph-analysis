abstract = {Abstract Recently, self-similarity of complex networks have attracted much attention. Fractal dimension of complex network is an open issue. Hub repulsion plays an important role in fractal topologies. This paper models the repulsion among the nodes in the complex networks in calculation of the fractal dimension of the networks. Coulomb’s law is adopted to represent the repulse between two nodes of the network quantitatively. A new method to calculate the fractal dimension of complex networks is proposed. The Sierpinski triangle network and some real complex networks are investigated. The results are illustrated to show that the new model of self-similarity of complex networks is reasonable and efficient. }}

abstract = {Abstract With increasing amount of information, mainly due to the explosive growth of Internet, the demand for applications of automatic text analysis has also grown. One of the tools that has increased in importance in the understanding of problems related to this area are complex networks. This tool merges graph theory and statistical methods for modeling important problems. In several research fields, complex networks are studied from the various points of view, such as: topology of networks, extraction of physical features and statistics, specific applications, comparison of metrics and study of physical phenomena. Linguistic is one area that has received great attention, particularly due to its close relationship with issues arising from the emergence of large text databases. Thus, many studies have emerged for modeling of complex networks in this area, increasing the demand for efficient algorithms for feature extraction, network dynamic observation and comparison of behavior for different types of languages. Some works for specific languages such as English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Russian and Arabic, have discussed the semantic aspects of these languages. On the other hand, as an important feature of a network we can highlight the computation of average clustering coefficient. This measure has a physical impact on the network topology studies and consequently on the conclusions about the semantics of a language. However its computational time is of O(n3), making its computing prohibitive for large current databases. This paper presents as main contribution a modeling of two complex networks: the first one, in English, is constructed from a specific medical database; the second, in Portuguese, from a journalistic manually annotated database. Our paper then presents the study of the dynamics of these two networks. We show their small-world behavior and the influence of hubs, suggesting that these databases have a high degree of Modularity, indicating specific contexts of words. Also, a method for efficient clustering coefficient computation is presented, and can be applied to large current databases. Other features such as fraction of reciprocal connections and average connection density are also calculated and discussed for both networks. }}

Furthermore, in phase space reconstruction, we discuss how to determine delay time constant and embedding dimension and how to select optimal critical threshold in terms of cumulative degree distribution. In the visibility graph, we design a method to construct network from multi-variables time series based on logical OR. Finally, we study and compare the statistic features of the networks converted from original traffic time series in three states based on phase space and visibility by using the degree distribution, network structure, correlation of the cluster coefficient to betweenness and degree–degree correlation. }}

The increasing observation requirements and orbiting satellites have exacerbated the scheduling complexity in recent years. In this paper, the single agile satellite, redundant observation targets scheduling problem is studied. We introduce the theory of complex networks and find similarities between \{AEOS\} redundant targets scheduling problem and the node centrality ranking problem. Then we model this problem as a complex network, regarding each node as a possible observation opportunity, and define two factors, node importance factor and target importance factor, to describe the node/target importance. Based on the two factors, we propose a fast approximate scheduling algorithm (FASA) to obtain the effective scheduling results. Simulation results indicate the \{FASA\} is quite efficient and with broad suitability. Our work is helpful in the \{EOSs\} and \{AEOSs\} scheduling problems by using complex network knowledge. }}

This is an advancement over origin-destination matrices, since freight vehicles are studied at a disaggregate level. Digicore Fleet Management has provided \{GPS\} data of over 40,000 freight vehicles travelling in South Africa over a six month period, from which freight activity chains can be extracted. The first contribution of this paper is to generate synthetic freight activity chains using a complex network that captures the connectivity between firms where freight activities take place, and therefore also captures some aspect of the behaviour of the vehicles. The complex network is built with the activity chains of 60% randomly selected freight vehicles, called the training set. 10 synthetic populations are generated using this complex network, each representing a 10% sample of the total freight population in South Africa. As a second contribution, we use the observed activity chains of the remaining 40% of vehicles, called the test set, to compare to the synthesised activity chains. The results indicate that the complex network approach of generating synthetic populations correctly estimates the fraction of activity chains for different chain lengths. The chain start times of the synthetic populations are generally similar to that of the observed activity chains, except for some underestimation during the morning peak hours. Vehicle kilometres travelled are only slightly overestimated in the synthetic activity chains. This complex network approach to generating synthetic freight populations is novel, and the results indicate that the synthetic populations generated are an accurate representation of South Africa's freight population. }}

Theoretically, the asymptotic stability of the malware-free equilibrium is confirmed when the threshold is below the unity, and the global stability is further proved under some sufficient conditions. The influences of different model parameters as well as the network topology on malware propagation are also analyzed. Our theoretical studies and numerical simulations show that networks with higher heterogeneity conduce to the diffusion of malware, and complex networks with lower power-law exponents benefit malware spreading. }}

The method creates a complex network with boundary points of 2D shapes, and the dynamic of the network is analyzed by means of the spectral graph theory. The eigenvalues of the graph spectrum are combined to create a shape descriptor or signature that is robust under rotation, scale, noise and occlusions. The graph spectrum is associated with its topological properties and can be used to recognize the patterns of a shape. The \{CNSS\} method has been tested with a 2D shape benchmark database and is employed for action human activity shapes. The method achieved very good results for discriminating object shapes in different classes, including in situations where there are objects with high levels of within-class variation, partial occlusion and noise contamination. }}

abstract = {Abstract With recent improvements in instrumentation and computer infrastructure, machine vision technologies have produced innovative approaches for controlling and monitoring mineral flotation process. In order to efficiently analyze froth image, froth texture is used to accurately and rapidly extract froth characteristics based on the statistics of image pixels. The characterization and identification of texture require a method that can express the context surrounding each pixel by combining local and global texture characteristics. To extract the distinctive froth texture features in different production states, a novel complex networks-based texture extraction and classification method for froth imaging is proposed in this paper. A network model is constructed by expressing pixels as network nodes and similarities between pixels as network links. This method automatically sets the optimal algorithm parameters for the complex network modeling of the froth images according to bubble sizes by using the Minkowski distance. Energy and entropy measurements are used to quantify the properties of the connectivity and topology of the froth-image network model. Copper froth images at different production states extracted from the flotation monitoring system in a flotation plant are used to test the froth-image network model. The experimental results show that the proposed method accurately describes the froth image texture and also robustly classifies the different production states. }}

We survey three major lines of linguistic research from the complex network approach: 1) characterization of human language as a multi-level system with complex network analysis; 2) linguistic typological research with the application of linguistic networks and their quantitative measures; and 3) relationships between the system-level complexity of human language (determined by the topology of linguistic networks) and microscopic linguistic (e.g., syntactic) features (as the traditional concern of linguistics). We show that the models and quantitative tools of complex networks, when exploited properly, can constitute an operational methodology for linguistic inquiry, which contributes to the understanding of human language and the development of linguistics. We conclude our review with suggestions for future linguistic research from the complex network approach: 1) relationships between the system-level complexity of human language and microscopic linguistic features; 2) expansion of research scope from the global properties to other levels of granularity of linguistic networks; and 3) combination of linguistic network analysis with other quantitative studies of language (such as quantitative linguistics). }}

By modeling the switching of network topologies as a Markov process, a novel event-triggered synchronization strategy is proposed. Unlike the existing strategies, the event detection of this strategy only works at the network topology switching time instant, which can significantly decrease the communication frequency between nodes and save the network resources. Under this strategy, the synchronization problem of complex network is equivalently converted to the stability of a class of Markovian jump systems with a time-varying delay. By using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method and the weak infinitesimal operation, a sufficient condition for the mean square synchronization of the complex networks subject to Markovian switching topologies is established. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the theoretical results. }}

Second, to obtain more insight into the complexity and periodicity in traffic time series, we then construct complex networks from traffic time series by considering each day as a cycle and each cycle as a single node. The optimal threshold value of complex networks is estimated by the distribution of density and its derivative. In addition, the complex networks are subsequently analyzed in terms of some statistical properties, such as average path length, clustering coefficient, density, average degree and betweenness. Finally, take 2 min aggregation data as example, we use the correlation coefficient matrix, adjacent matrix and closeness to exploit the periodicity of weekdays and weekends in traffic flow data.

In this paper, we use complex network theory to study traffic time series, which provide a new insight into traffic flow analysis. Firstly, the phase space, which describes the evolution of the behavior of a nonlinear system, is reconstructed using the delay embedding theorem. Secondly, in order to convert the new time series into a complex network, the critical threshold is estimated by the characteristics of a complex network, which include degree distribution, cumulative degree distribution, and density and clustering coefficients. We find that the degree distribution of associated complex network can be fitted with a Gaussian function, and the cumulative degree distribution can be fitted with an exponential function. Density and clustering coefficients are then researched to reflect the change of connections between nodes in complex network, and the results are in accordance with the observation of the plot of an adjacent matrix. Consequently, based on complex network analysis, the proper range of the critical threshold is determined. Finally, to mine the nodes with the closest relations in a complex network, the modularity is calculated with the increase of critical threshold and the community structure is detected according to the optimal modularity. The work in our paper provides a new way to understand the dynamics of traffic time series. }}

The concept is established according to the local information which considers the correlation among all neighbors of a node.

The simulation result shows that the new centrality is more efficient than traditional attack strategies, whether it is static or dynamic. }}

In this paper, we discuss an elastic model to enhance the control of undirected networks and study the controllability of random networks with built-in gradually varied modularity as well as real-world networks to elaborate the correlation between the networks’ controllability and modularity. The results show that it is easier to control the networks with stronger modularity than that of weaker modularity, and the networks with larger size communities probably need more driver nodes to control than that of smaller size communities when we fix both the number of nodes and the number of links of the networks. In addition, the robustness analysis indicates that the model enhances the resistance of networks against link failure. This work shows that the controllability of complex networks is highly associated with the networks’ degree distribution as well as the networks’ modularity, which gives a new insight into the understanding of controllability and modularity of complex networks. }}

We consider that local and global properties of a node as the degree and relative average degree of the node respectively. We prove that the degree distribution of complex networks generated by \{CDPAM\} follow power law with exponent lies in the interval [2,3] and the expected diameter grows logarithmically with the size of new nodes added to the initial small network. Numerical results show that the expected diameter stabilizes when alike weights to the local and global properties are assigned by the new nodes. Computing various measures including clustering coefficient, assortativity, number of triangles, algebraic connectivity, spectral radius, we show that the proposed model replicates properties of real networks when alike weights are given to local and global property. Finally, we observe that the \{BA\} model is a limiting case of \{CDPAM\} when new nodes tend to give large weight to the local property compared to the weight given to the global property during link formation. }}

abstract = {Abstract Process monitoring in chemical industrial is a challenging task due to a larger number of measured variables and complex interactions among them. To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel process monitoring method combining complex network theory with principal component analysis (PCA) is developed. The proposed process monitoring method takes into account not only global information of measured variables, but also the relationships among them and their neighbors. The basic idea of proposed method is to first represent the chemical industrial process as a complex network and then to design its dynamic topological network feature to characterize the local structure information of each measured variable, and monitor the process with conventional global analysis techniques. To build the complex network model, the process measured variables are represented as network nodes. The kernel canonical correlation coefficients that correspond with different measured variables are averaged and represented as network edge. A dynamic change in the threshold method is applied to the evolution of complex network, based on which, the dynamic average degree (DAD) is designed to characterize the local structure information of measured variable. Two case studies including a simple simulation and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process are employed to evaluate the process monitoring performance of the proposed method. The results show that this method has improved fault detection rate (FDR) in comparison with other currently existing conventional process monitoring methods. }}

Secondly, a measurement considering the effective paths number is proposed to evaluate freeway network's connective reliability. Finally, based on the freeway network in Shandong Province (SFN), which is the largest scale freeway network in eastern China, those evaluation indicators are calculated, and the freeway network's connective reliability are evaluated under different scenarios. The nodes with high structural betweenness must be given more protection so as to improve the reliability of the \{SFN\} under random attack The structural properties and reliability analysis of freeway networks are helpful for road planning and unexpected major events control. }}

The primary results show (1) the propagation network presents small world feature, which means relations among media are close and breaking news originating from any node can spread rapidly; (2) traditional media and official websites are the typical sources for news propagation, while business portals are news collectors and spreaders; (3) the propagation network is assortative and the group of core media facilities the spread of breaking news faster; (4) for online media, news originality factor become less important to propagation behaviors. This study offers a new insight to explore information dissemination from the perspective of statistical physics and is beneficial for utilizing the public opinion in a positive way. }}

This paper proposes the use of an approximated artificial neural network (AANN) approach for the case of reliability when complex network design is considered. A mesh network of 256 nodes and hyper-tree network of 496 nodes are considered for evaluating the performance of \{AANN\} algorithm for improving reliability and minimizing cost for complex network. Since, evaluating reliability for complex network using formal approach requires substantial computational effort and time equivalent to NP-Hard. The work presented in this paper compares the performance of \{AANN\} algorithm with that of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for improving reliability and minimizing cost for complex network problems. The simulation results show that the performance of \{AANN\} algorithm is comparable to those of the mentioned algorithms and can be used to improve reliability and reduce the cost for complex network design problems when amount of complexity is relatively higher. }}

A hybrid feedback control method is designed to achieve function projective synchronization for the complex network.

Furthermore, we also present a probability approach to the method of Lyapunov functionals to analyze function projective synchronization in the dynamical network under a particular assumption. Our approaches not only can replace the LaSalle-type theorem but also allow improvements of existing results in the literature.

Recently, major studies are reported for the characterization of social networks due to a growing trend in analysis of online social networks as dynamic complex large-scale graphs. Due to the large scale and limited access of real networks, the network model is characterized using an appropriate part of a network by sampling approaches. In this paper, a new sampling algorithm based on distributed learning automata has been proposed for sampling from complex networks. In the proposed algorithm, a set of distributed learning automata cooperate with each other in order to take appropriate samples from the given network. To investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several simulation experiments are conducted on well-known complex networks. Experimental results are compared with several sampling methods in terms of different measures. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the others. }}

Five kinds of flow pattern including bubble flow, bubble–slug flow, slug flow, slug–churn flow and churn flow are measured, and then constructed 178 corresponding flow pattern complex networks in order to reveal the dynamical characteristics of two-phase flow. It is found that different flow pattern complex network present different community structure, when the correspondence between the threshold and the mean of similarity matrix meet specific proportion. The results show that the power-law exponent of degree distribution and network information entropy of flow pattern complex network is sensitive to the flow pattern transition, which can be employed to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of two-phase flow.

The efficiency of the proposed solution was verified by comparing it with other attack strategies used in various model networks and real-world network. Numerical experiments suggest that our solution can improve the effect of network disintegration and that the “best” choice for node failure attacks can be identified through global searches. Our understanding of the optimal attack strategy may also shed light on a new property of the nodes within network disintegration and deserves additional study. }}

To this end, we first adopt two widely used quantities as the measures for the dissimilarity between vertices. The dissimilarity is then transformed into its corresponding distance in a Euclidean space via the non-metric multidimensional scaling. We applied the proposed method to real-world as well as models of complex networks. We empirically found that real-world complex networks were embedded in a Euclidean space of relatively lower dimensions and the configuration of vertices in the space was mostly characterized by the self-similarity of a multifractal. In contrast, by applying the same scheme to the network models, we found that, in general, higher dimensions were needed to embed the networks into a Euclidean space and the embedding results usually did not exhibit the self-similar property. From the analysis, we learn that the proposed method serves a way not only to visualize the complex networks in a Euclidean space but to characterize the complex networks in a different manner from conventional ways. }}

In this \{GUTR\} neural network model, each transition rate can be completely unknown or only its estimate value is known. This new uncertain model could be applied to many practical cases. Based on the Lyapunov functional method and Kronecker product technique, a sufficient condition on the exponentially synchronization in mean square is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)-which can be easily solved by using the Matlab \{LMI\} toolbox. Finally, one numerical example is well-studied to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method. }}

In the present paper, we further study complex networks with an exponential vertex-degree distribution and prove that the same conclusion also holds. In addition, we verify our claim by showing many real-world examples. We finally discuss some applications of the new finding in various fields of science and technology. }}

Meanwhile, by analyzing complex networks at a community level, the overlapping clustering of nodes is well implemented, and better clustering effects can be achieved by grouping similar edges together. On the basis of datasets with different types and sizes, the experiments illustrate the simplification degree of the intricate graphs created by the algorithm proposed, which outperforms established competitors in correctness and effectiveness. }}

The energy international trade network is formed through the energy imports and exports among countries. From the characteristics of the network we can know the changes in energy trade patterns. According to the international energy trade data which include crude oil, coal and natural gas data published by The United Nations Statistics Division from 1996 to 2012, with the state as the node and the energy flows of trade for the side, this article constructed directed energy international trade complex network with out-weighted edges. This article calculated such complex network properties as node degree, network structure entropy, average clustering coefficient, and average nearest neighbor degree of the energy international trade complex network. Based on these characteristics, this article analyzed the degree distribution, heterogeneity, clustering, and vertex intensity correlation of the energy international trade complex network. We find that countries increased tightness and strengthened interdependence when they carry out the international energy trade. Transportation costs and customs tax, etc. will not have much impact on the import and export of fossil fuels. It will be more frequently trading with each other among countries’ partner who have smaller population or lower economic strength. Small countries tend to make energy trade relations with regional hubs in local area. Global trading countries have a lot of partners around the world. If energy war, crisis or other issues occur in these countries, it is likely to spread to other countries, so that the global fossil energy trade will be affected. }}

We systematically carried out oil–gas–water three-phase flow experiments for measuring the time series of flow signals, which is studied in terms of the mapping from time series to complex networks. Two network mapping methods are proposed for the analysis and identification of flow pattern dynamics, i.e. Flow Pattern Complex Network (FPCN) and Fluid Dynamic Complex Network (FDCN). Through detecting the community structure of \{FPCN\} based on K-means clustering, distinct flow patterns can be successfully distinguished and identified. A number of FDCN's under different flow conditions are constructed in order to reveal the dynamical characteristics of three-phase flows. The network information entropy of \{FDCN\} is sensitive to the transition among different flow patterns, which can be used to characterize nonlinear dynamics of the three-phase flow. These interesting and significant findings suggest that complex networks can be a potentially powerful tool for uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of oil–gas–water three-phase flows. }}

The comparison between the gravity centrality index and some well-known centralities, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and k-shell centrality, and so forth, indicates that our method can effectively identify the influential spreaders in real networks as well as synthetic networks.

Second, we show how the definition of complex network dimension can be reformulated by defining the concept for a single node, and then defining the complex network dimension as the supremum over all nodes. This makes the concept work better for formally infinite graphs. Third, we study interesting parallels to zeta dimension, a notion originally from number theory which has found connections to theoretical computer science.

Based on the finite-time stability theory, an effective control input and a feedback control with an updated law are designed to realize finite-time synchronization between two complex networks. The unknown network topological structure and system parameters of uncertain general complex dynamical networks are identified simultaneously. Since finite-time topology identification means the suboptimum in identified time, the results of this paper are important. Several useful criteria for finite-time synchronization are given. Finally, two examples simulations for supporting the theoretical results are also provided. }}

Secondly, in order to evaluate the node importance comprehensively, a multi-attribute ranking method is proposed based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Object (TOPSIS).

The theoretical results in this paper have generalized the synchronization-based identification method that has been reported in several literatures on identifying integer order complex networks. We further derive the sufficient condition that ensures successful network identification. An uncertain complex network with four fractional-order Lorenz systems is employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The numerical results show that this approach is applicable for online monitoring of the static or changing network topology. In addition, we present a discussion to explore which factor would influence the identification process. Certain interesting conclusions from the discussion are obtained, which reveal that large coupling strengths and small fractional orders are both harmful for a successful identification. }}

For this purpose production systems are modeled as complex networks, in which nodes represent machines and edges represent the material flow between them.

Unlike existing complex network models, the information transmission between the nodes is assumed to have an imperfect physical condition — only partial information can be transmitted. Furthermore, for varying connections, the partly transmitted information can be completely distinct. This communication constraint makes the network harder to achieve synchronization. To reflect a more practical situation, we consider the complex networks with two typical kinds of inner coupling matrix: diagonal matrix and lower triangle matrix. By using an efficient decomposition method, some synchronization criteria are then derived for the complex networks with partial information transmission. Finally, a complex network with chaotic dynamics is constructed as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. }}

It currently serves as a research tool in a broad range of human brain studies in normal and pathological conditions, as is the case of epilepsy. To date, most fMRI studies aimed at characterizing brain activity in response to various active paradigms. More recently, a number of strategies have been used to characterize the low-frequency oscillations of the ongoing fMRI signals when individuals are at rest. These datasets have been largely analyzed in the context of functional connectivity, which inspects the covariance of fMRI signals from different areas of the brain. In addition, resting state fMRI is progressively being used to evaluate complex network features of the brain. These strategies have been applied to a number of different problems in neuroscience, which include diseases such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Hence, we herein aimed at introducing the subject of complex network and how to use it for the analysis of fMRI data. This appears to be a promising strategy to be used in clinical epilepsy. Therefore, we also review the recent literature that has applied these ideas to the analysis of fMRI data in patients with epilepsy.

The understanding of the pattern of the crude oil prices’ mutual propagation is essential for analyzing the development of global oil trade. Previous research has focused mainly on the fuzzy long- or short-term one-to-one propagation of bivariate oil prices, generally ignoring various patterns of periodical multivariate propagation. This study presents a wavelet-based network approach to help uncover the multipath propagation of multivariable crude oil prices in a joint time–frequency period. The weekly oil spot prices of the \{OPEC\} member states from June 1999 to March 2011 are adopted as the sample data. First, we used wavelet analysis to find different subseries based on an optimal decomposing scale to describe the periodical feature of the original oil price time series. Second, a complex network model was constructed based on an optimal threshold selection to describe the structural feature of multivariable oil prices. Third, Bayesian network analysis (BNA) was conducted to find the probability causal relationship based on periodical structural features to describe the various patterns of periodical multivariable propagation. Finally, the significance of the leading and intermediary oil prices is discussed. These findings are beneficial for the implementation of periodical target-oriented pricing policies and investment strategies. }}

As per the multiple origin spreaders, the K-Shell method fails to yield similar results when compared to the degree centrality. Current research proposes a Pareto-Shell Decomposition. It employs Pareto front function. It’s Pareto optimal set comprises non-dominated spreads, with the ratio of high out-degree to in-degree and high in-degree. Pareto-Shell decomposition outperforms the K-Shell and the degree centrality for multiple origin spreaders, with the simulation of epidemic spreading process. }}

We analyze theoretical models (random, small-world and scale-free) and real networks (a collaboration network and a metabolic networks) along with the shortest path length, vertex degree, local cluster coefficient and betweenness centrality measures. In such an analysis, we propose the use of three stochastic quantifiers: the Kullback–Leibler divergence and the Jensen–Shannon and Hellinger distances. The sensitivity of these measures was analyzed with respect to the following perturbations: edge addition, edge removal, edge rewiring and node removal, all of them applied at different intensities. The results reveal that the evaluated measures are influenced by these perturbations. Additionally, hypotheses tests were performed to verify the behavior of the degree distribution to identify the intensity of the perturbations that leads to break this property. }}

In this pursuit, we introduce a metric called the assortativity weight of an edge, defined as the product of the number of uncovered adjacent edges and the absolute value of the difference in the weights of the end vertices. The \{MAM\} algorithm prefers to include edges that have the smallest assortativity weight in each iteration (one edge per iteration) until all edges are covered. The \{MAM\} algorithm can also be adapted to determine a maximal dissortative matching (MDM) to maximize the dissimilarity between the end vertices that are part of a matching as well as to determine a maximal node matching (MNM) that simply maximizes the number of vertices that are part of the matching. We run the MAM, \{MNM\} and \{MDM\} algorithms on real-world network graphs as well as on the theoretical model-based random network graphs and scale-free network graphs and analyze the tradeoffs between the % of node matches and assortativity index (targeted optimal values: 1 for \{MAM\} and −1 for MDM). }}

abstract = {Abstract Modeling software systems using complex networks can be an effective technique for analyzing the complexity of software systems. To enhance the technique, the structure of a complex network can be extended by assigning a weight to the edges of the complex network to denote the strength of communicational cohesion between a pair of related software components. This paper proposes an approach to represent an object-oriented software system using a weighted complex network in order to capture its structural characteristics, with respect to its maintainability and reliability. Nodes and edges are modeled based on the complexities of classes and their dependencies. Graph theory metrics are applied onto the transformed network with the purpose to evaluate the software system. Comparative analysis is performed using 40 object-oriented software systems, with different levels of maintenance effort. We found that common statistical patterns from the software systems can be identified easily. It is when these software systems are grouped and compared based on their levels of maintenance effort that their statistical patterns are more distinguishable to represent some common behavior and structural complexity of object-oriented software. The evaluations indicate that the proposed approach is capable of identifying software components that violate common software design principles. }}

In the proposed approach, each pixel of the video is mapped into a node of the complex network. Initially, a regular complex network is obtained by connecting two nodes if the Euclidean distance between their related pixels is equal or less than a given radius. For each connection, a weight is defined by the difference of the pixel intensities. Given the regular complex network, a function is applied to remove connections whose weight is equal to or below a given threshold. Finally, a feature vector is obtained by calculating the spatial and temporal average degree for networks transformed by different values of threshold and radius. The number of connections of pixels from the same frame and from different frames, respectively, gives the spatial and temporal degrees. Experimental results using synthetic and real dynamic textures have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. }}

For degree-uncorrelated networks, the model is reduced to the \{SIS\} epidemic model in networks after removing the immunized nodes.

In order to quantitatively describe variations in the amount of information during the spreading process, this article proposes a safety information radiation model on the basis of communication theory, combining with relevant theories of complex networks. This model comprehensively considers the various influence factors when safety information radiates in the network, and introduces some concepts from the communication theory perspective, such as the radiation gain function, receiving gain function, information retaining capacity and information second reception capacity, to describe the safety information radiation process between nodes and dynamically investigate the states of network nodes. On a micro level, this article analyzes the influence of various initial conditions and parameters on safety information radiation through the new model simulation. The simulation reveals that this novel approach can reflect the variation of safety information quantity of each node in the complex network, and the scale-free network has better ”radiation explosive power”, while the small-world network has better ”radiation staying power”. The results also show that it is efficient to improve the overall performance of network security by selecting nodes with high degrees as the information source, refining and simplifying the information, increasing the information second reception capacity and decreasing the noises. In a word, this article lays the foundation for further research on the interactions of information and energy between internal components within complex systems. }}

Then, we propose a modality transition-based network for mapping the experimental multivariate measurements into a directed weighted complex network. In particular, we derive multivariate complex networks from different flow conditions and demonstrate that the generated networks corresponding to different flow patterns exhibit distinct topological structures. For each generated network, we exploit weighted clustering coefficient and closeness centrality to quantitatively probe the network topological properties associated with dynamic flow behavior. The results suggest that our multivariate complex network analysis allows quantitatively uncovering the transitions of distinct flow patterns and yields deep insights into the nonlinear dynamic behavior underlying gas–liquid flows. }}

An adaptive mechanism is designed to estimate the dependency rate of signals and constant bounds. Then the robust adaptive compensation controllers are constructed to automatically eliminate the effects of perturbations and nonlinearities based on the estimations, and simultaneously to specify the L 2 performance of networks. Through Lyapunov functions and adaptive schemes, the achievement of asymptotic synchronization of the closed-loop adaptive complex networks is obtained with satisfying a specified L 2 performance criterion.

abstract = {Abstract In its more visionary acceptation, the smart grid is a model of energy management in which the users are engaged in producing energy as well as consuming it, while having information systems fully aware of the energy demand-response of the network and of dynamically varying prices. A natural question is then: to make the smart grid a reality will the distribution grid have to be upgraded? We assume a positive answer to the question and we consider the lower layers of medium and low voltage to be the most affected by the change. In our previous work, we analyzed samples of the Dutch distribution grid (Pagani and Aiello, 2011) and we considered possible evolutions of these using synthetic topologies modeled after studies of complex systems in other technological domains (Pagani and Aiello, 2014). In this paper, we take an extra important step by defining a methodology for evolving any existing physical power grid to a good smart grid model, thus laying the foundations for a decision support system for utilities and governmental organizations. In doing so, we consider several possible evolution strategies and apply them to the Dutch distribution grid. We show how increasing connectivity is beneficial in realizing more efficient and reliable networks. Our proposal is topological in nature, enhanced with economic considerations of the costs of such evolutions in terms of cabling expenses and economic benefits of evolving the grid. }}

Surprisingly, the derived communities for any self-organized and/or self-evolved large networks demonstrate very striking power laws, implying that there are far more small communities than large ones. This notion of far more small things than large ones constitutes a new fundamental way of thinking for community detection. }}

Community detection is the process of discovering the community structure hidden in complex networks, and modularity Q is one of the best known quality functions measuring the quality of communities of networks. In this paper, a multi-agent genetic algorithm, named as MAGA-Net, is proposed to optimize modularity value for the community detection. An agent, coded by a division of a network, represents a candidate solution. All agents live in a lattice-like environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice point. A series of operators are designed, namely split and merging based neighborhood competition operator, hybrid neighborhood crossover, adaptive mutation and self-learning operator, to increase modularity value. In the experiments, the performance of MAGA-Net is validated on both well-known real-world benchmark networks and large-scale synthetic \{LFR\} networks with 5000 nodes. The systematic comparisons with GA-Net and Meme-Net show that MAGA-Net outperforms these two algorithms, and can detect communities with high speed, accuracy and stability. }}

However, in these methods, several objects that are connected by high weights may be decomposed into different communities, even when they intuitively belong to a single community. In this case, it is more effective to classify the objects into the same community because they perform important roles in controlling and understanding the network. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose a method of detecting optimal community structures in a complex network using interaction-based edge clustering. Our approach is to consider network topology as well as interaction density when identifying overlapping and hierarchical communities. Additionally, we measure the differences between the quantity and quality of intra- and inter-community interactions to evaluate the quality of the community structure. We test our method on several benchmark networks with known community structures. Additionally, after applying our method to several real-world complex networks, we evaluate our method through comparison with other methods. We find that the community quality and the overlap quality for our method surpass the results of the other methods. }}

This paper proposes a novel wavelet-based complex network method to investigate the evolution feature of the world crude oil market integration and diversification from the perspective of the interdependent structural relationship of global oil prices, so that two critical reference indexes, namely the reference decision-making cycle and the target regional market, will be proposed for decision makers to better adjust their strategies. The results show that the dominant evolution cycle of the market integration from the stable stage to the high shock stage is time-varying, featuring the weekly → weekly → short yearly → short quarterly → short monthly cycle, and the dominant evolution cycle of the market diversification is also time-varying, characterized by the short monthly → weekly → long yearly → weekly → weekly cycle. These findings provide a clearer reference decision-making cycle for decision makers to create a more efficient period-oriented strategy. Two larger stable homogeneous groups of regional oil markets and the dominant regional markets in the process of the market evolution are discovered, providing more details regarding the target monitoring regional market for the oil-related early warning strategy and hedging strategies. }}

abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the synchronization of a fractional-order colored complex dynamical network model is studied for the first time. In this network model, color edges imply that both the outer coupling topology and the inner interactions between any pair of nodes may be different, and color nodes mean that local dynamics may be different. Based on the stability theory of fractional-order systems, the scheme of synchronization for fractional-order colored complex dynamical networks is presented. To achieve the synchronization of a complex fractional-order edge-colored network, the open-plus-closed-loop (OPCL) strategy is adopted and effective controllers for synchronization are designed. The open-plus-closed-loop (OPCL) strategy avoids the need for computation of eigenvalues of a very large matrix. Then, a synchronization method for a class of fractional-order colored complex network, containing both colored edges and colored nodes, is developed and some effective synchronization conditions via close-loop control are presented. Two examples of numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies. }}

Six network performance metrics, including four new metrics, are applied to quantify networks’ diffusion speed, diffusion scale, homogeneity, and diameter. In order to efficiently identify nodes whose removal maximally destroys a network, i.e., minimizes network performance, ten structured heuristic node removal strategies are designed using different node centrality metrics including degree, betweenness, reciprocal closeness, complement-derived closeness, and eigenvector centrality. These strategies are applied to remove nodes from the September 11, 2001 hijackers’ network, and their performance are compared to that of a random strategy, which removes randomly selected nodes, and the locally optimal solution (LOS), which removes nodes to minimize network performance at each step. The computational complexity of the 11 strategies and \{LOS\} is also analyzed. Results show that the node removal strategies using degree and betweenness centralities are more efficient than other strategies. }}

What’s more, when such a disaster happens, it can spread in a wide range with ubiquitous presence of a large-scale networked system. Therefore, the emergency/disaster management faces new challenges that the decision-makers have extra difficulties in perceiving the disaster dynamic spreading processes under this networked environment. This study tries to use the complex networks theory to tackle this complexity and the result shows the theory is a promising approach to support disaster/emergency management by focusing on simulation experiments of small world networks and scale free networks. The theory can be used to capture and describe the evolution mechanism, evolution discipline and overall behavior of a networked system. In particular, the complex networks theory is very strong at analyzing the complexity and dynamical changes of a networked system, which can improve the situation awareness after a disaster has occurred and help perceive its dynamic process, which is very important for high-quality decision making. In addition, this study also shows the use of the complex networks theory can build a visualized process to track the dynamic spreading of a disaster in a networked system. }}

Three key indices of a complex network are listed and we relate them with the train service plan. Based on the three indices, we define the convenience degree for traveling, the transferring times, the travel time, and station clustering coefficients to evaluate the train service plan. A computing case is performed to illustrate the applications of the evaluation model and the algorithm. The results show that the evaluating results can be attained via the method proposed effectively, which can offer supporting information for decision makers of the railway operation bureaus.

They can obtain the rumor from different sources like online social networks and then publish it on their personal sites. In our paper, we discuss this phenomenon in complex networks by adopting the concept of independent spreaders. Rather than getting the rumor from neighbors, independent spreaders learn it from other channels. We further develop the classic “ignorant-spreaders-stiflers” or \{SIR\} model of rumor diffusion process in complex networks. A steady-state analysis is conducted to investigate the final spectrum of the rumor spreading under various spreading rate, stifling rate, density of independent spreaders and average degree of the network. Results show that independent spreaders effectively enhance the rumor diffusion process, by delivering the rumor to regions far away from the current rumor infected regions. And though the rumor spreading process in \{SF\} networks is faster than that in \{ER\} networks, the final size of rumor spreading in \{ER\} networks is larger than that in \{SF\} networks. }}

The derived criteria are less conservative than the existing ones. In addition, the desired sampled-data controllers are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. }}

During the ant colony search, the method uses a new fitness function to percept local environment and employs a pheromone diffusion model as a global information feedback mechanism to realize information exchange among ants. A significant advantage of our method is that the locations in the grid environment and the connections of the complex network structure are simultaneously taken into account in ants moving. Experimental results on computer-generated and real-world networks show the capability of our method to successfully detect community structures. }}

And from the point of view of energy saving, some selected links were strengthened. Theoretical analysis and simulations on different complex networks indicate that the proposed pinning strategy is effective.

Although various centrality measures have been proposed to address this problem, such as degree, betweenness, and closeness centralities, they all have some limitations. Recently, technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), as a tradeoff between the existing metrics, has been proposed to rank nodes effectively and efficiently. It regards the centrality measures as the multi-attribute of the complex network and connects the multi-attribute to synthesize the evaluation of node importance of each node. However, each attribute plays an equally important part in this method, which is not reasonable. In this paper, we improve the method to ranking the node’s spreading ability. A new method, named as weighted technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (weighted TOPSIS) is proposed. In our method, we not only consider different centrality measures as the multi-attribute to the network, but also propose a new algorithm to calculate the weight of each attribute. To evaluate the performance of our method, we use the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model to do the simulation on four real networks. The experiments on four real networks show that the proposed method can rank the spreading ability of nodes more accurately than the original method. }}

The relationships of vulnerability results from different models are analyzed and discussed for model comparisons. Taking \{IEEE\} 300 power grid with line capacity set proportional to tolerant parameter tp as example, the results show that there exists a critical node attack intensity A I = 0.147 , above which the three models produce almost identical topology-based vulnerability results under each attack strategy at any t p ⩾ 1 , while producing identical flow-based vulnerability results from \{PTM\} and \{DCPFM\} occurs at A I &gt; 0.147 , and A I &gt; 0.73 for \{BBM\} and DCPFM, which indicates that the \{PTM\} can better approach the \{DCPFM\} for flow-based vulnerability analysis under intentional attacks.

Two-layer complex networks with a homogeneous physical topology are found to be more tolerant to congestion. Moreover, simulation results show that the heterogeneity of logical and physical topologies makes the packet-delivery process of two-layer networks more efficient in the free-flow state, without the occurrence of traffic congestion. }}

The coupled networks are supposed to be faulted randomly and perturbed by bounded time delays and disturbances. Moreover, additive controller gain variations that can also be considered as actuator bias faults are proposed. Adaptive sliding mode compensation control schemes were developed to update control gains in order to eliminate these non-ideal factors. Then, a class of distributed robust adaptive sliding mode controllers was constructed to automatically compensate for the faulted and variational effects based on the information from adaptive schemes. On the basis of Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that average tracking of the resulting adaptive complex networked systems can be achieved. An example is provided to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sliding mode design technique. }}

Complex-networks constitute an approach to the study of emergent properties of complex systems that strongly focuses and relies on models and measures, through which build the system interdependence. Several contributions of complex-networks are: topology always affects the function; separated from the domain; quantification of element's relationships; visibility and capture of emergent properties. This work expects to contribute for the appropriate use of complex-networks models and measure in the drive of the information systems alignment. This work considers an exploratory case research strategy. It uses an exploratory case developed in the field of information systems that directed its deployment to sustain the business development and evolution. This paper illustrates a profiling framework that introduces a global and elementary use of the sociomaterial enactment. From the analysis of the exploratory case, the paper infers drivers of the information systems Business/IT alignment. }}

Numerical experiments on six real networks demonstrated the high effectiveness and efficiency of the new index compared with five well-known and widely accepted indices: the common neighbors, resource allocation index, preferential attachment index, local path index and Katz index. The new index provides competitively accurate prediction with local path index and Katz index while has less computational complexity and is more accurate than the other two indices. }}

The main metrics we study are the timing effect of combating rumor and the identification of influential nodes, which are what an efficient strategy against rumor may concern about. The results indicate that, there exists robust time dependence of anti-rumor dynamics and the timing threshold emerges as a consequence of launching the anti-rumor at different delay time after the beginning of rumor spreading. The timing threshold as a critical feature is further verified on a series of Barabási–Albert scale-free networks (BA networks), where anti-rumor dynamics arises explicitly. The timing threshold is a network-dependent quantity and its value decreases as the average degree of the \{BA\} network increases until close to zero. Meanwhile, coreness also constitutes a better topological descriptor to identify hubs. Our results will hopefully be useful for the understanding of spreading behaviors of rumor and anti-rumor and suggest a possible avenue for further study of interplays of multiple pieces of information on complex network. }}

Then two maximal sub-graphs having the key pair-vertices can be merged into a new larger sub-graph using some belonging degree functions. Furthermore we extend the modularity function to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In addition, overlapping nodes between communities are founded successfully. Finally we report the comparison between the modularity and the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm with some other existing algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm gives satisfactory results. }}

From this viewpoint, it is desirable that cities are planned through energy models able to achieve the efficiency in the use of sources and able to minimize \{GHG\} emissions. Hence, considering the modern cities as complex systems, the high variability of the energy demand is taken into account evaluating the dynamic evolution of the energy flows. Thus, this paper presents the development, evaluation and application of a flexible mathematical procedure able to characterize the energy profile of an urban area and its dynamic evolution through the implementation of the network theory. The obtained results allow proper scenario analysis for the definition of energy planning strategies focused on the promotion and installation of cogeneration systems and in favor of renewable sources. }}

In addition, \{TOPSIS\} is first applied to identify influential nodes in a complex network in this open issue. In different types of networks in which the information goes by different ways, we consider several different centrality measures as the multi-attribute of complex network in \{TOPSIS\} application. \{TOPSIS\} is utilized to aggregate the multi-attribute to obtain the evaluation of node importance of each node. It is not limited to only one centrality measure, but considers different centrality measures, because every centrality measure has its own disadvantage and limitation. Then, we use the Susceptible–Infected (SI) model to evaluate the performance. Numerical examples are given to show the efficiency and practicability of the proposed method. }}

We propose a novel approach of classifying social networks based on their topological aspects using motifs. As such, we define the classifiers for regular, random, small-world and scale-free topologies, and then apply this classification on empirical networks. We then show how our study brings a new perspective on differentiating between online social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus based on the distribution of network motifs over the fundamental topology classes. Characteristic patterns of motifs are obtained for each of the analyzed online networks and are used to better explain the functional properties behind how people interact online and to define classifiers capable of mapping any online network to a set of topological-communicational properties. }}

In this paper, the influences of the regenerated concentrations of contaminants on regenerated stream consumption are investigated for the fixed mass-load water networks with multiple contaminants. The multi-contaminant water networks involving regeneration recycling are classified into simple ones and complex ones in this paper. Simple networks are similar to single-contaminant ones, in which only the key contaminant limits the usage of regenerated water. The regenerated stream consumption of simple networks can be predicted easily when the regenerated concentration of the key contaminant changes. The concentrations of other contaminants, if having influence on the regenerated stream consumption as well, should be reduced to their maximum allowable values. There is great difference between the features of complex networks of multiple contaminants and that of networks of single contaminant. The influence of the regenerated concentrations on regenerated stream consumption of complex networks is analyzed based on mass balances of the contaminants. The contaminant which has the most influence on regenerated stream consumption is identified. The methods proposed can contribute to evaluation of the appropriate regenerated concentrations for design or retrofit of the water networks with multiple contaminants. }}

Most importantly, so far only a few metrics of complex networks have been used and therefore there is ample opportunity to enhance the statistics-based methods as new measures of network topology and dynamics are created. In this paper, we employ for the first time the metrics betweenness, vulnerability and diversity to analyze written texts in Brazilian Portuguese. Using strategies based on diversity metrics, a better performance in automatic summarization is achieved in comparison to previous work employing complex networks. With an optimized method the Rouge score (an automatic evaluation method used in summarization) was 0.5089, which is the best value ever achieved for an extractive summarizer with statistical methods based on complex networks for Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore, the diversity metric can detect keywords with high precision, which is why we believe it is suitable to produce good summaries. It is also shown that incorporating linguistic knowledge through a syntactic parser does enhance the performance of the automatic summarizers, as expected, but the increase in the Rouge score is only minor. These results reinforce the suitability of complex network methods for improving automatic summarizers in particular, and treating text in general. }}

We provide exact theoretical calculations, numerical approximations and error estimations of entropy, algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity for different types of graphs, characterizing their variant and invariant properties. We introduce formal definitions of complexity for both labeled and unlabeled graphs and prove that the Kolmogorov complexity of a labeled graph is a good approximation of its unlabeled Kolmogorov complexity and thus a robust definition of graph complexity. }}

We propose a method to enhance controllability of a directed network by changing the direction of a small fraction of links while keeping the total number of links unchanged. The main idea of the method is to find candidate links based on the matching path. Extensive numerical simulation on many modeled networks demonstrates that this method is effective. Furthermore, we find that the nodes linked to candidate links have a distinct character, which provide us with a strategy to improve the controllability based on the local structure. Since the whole topology of many real networks is not visible and we only get some local structure information, this strategy is potentially more practical compared to those that demand complete topology information. }}

For all other parameters, the heterogeneous networks are always highly vulnerable to the failure of high-degree nodes; this point is the same as in the structural robustness analysis. We also find that with random inactivation, heterogeneous networks are always more robust than the corresponding homogeneous networks with the same average degree except for one special parameter. Thus our findings give an integrated picture for the dynamical robustness analysis on complex networks. }}

Every node tries to transmit the epidemic to its neighbors after the waiting time. Moreover, by using the mean-field theory and numerical simulations, it is discovered that the epidemic threshold is correlated to the network topology and the distribution of the waiting time. Furthermore, our results reveal that an optimal distribution of the heterogeneous waiting time can suppress the epidemic spreading. }}

Based on complex network theory, we built a global fossil energy exergy flow network with countries as nodes, the international exergy flows as edges and the exergy of each flow as the weight of the edges. We analyzed the distribution of countries, the overall structure, major countries and major exergy flow paths of the network from 1996 to 2012. The results show that even if the fossil energy trade becomes more frequent and larger, there are always a few trade relationships and countries that play critical roles in the fossil energy trade. The trade relationship intensity at the global level is relatively lower than the corresponding intensity at the regional level. There are four main fossil energy trade groups, and these groups have the Russian Federation, the United States, Japan and Saudi Arabia as their core countries. If an energy war, an energy crisis or other problems occur in the countries with more partners, their impacts are likely to spread to other countries and even affect the global fossil energy trade. }}

The strategies are originated from \{ID\} (initial degree distribution) and \{RD\} (recalculated degree distribution) strategies in which attacks are based on initial structural information of a network. The probability of node removals depends on a new metric combining degree centrality and betweenness centrality. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed strategies on one real-world network and three network models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategies are more efficient than the traditional \{ID\} and \{RD\} strategies. Specially, the \{WS\} small-world network behaves more sensitive to the proposed strategies. The attack efficiency of \{RDB\} strategy is improved by 20% to \{RD\} strategy, and \{IDB\} strategy is improved by 40% to \{ID\} strategy. }}

A set of random variables satisfying certain probabilistic distributions is introduced to characterize the phenomenon of the missing measurements, where each sensor can have individual missing probability. The Taylor series expansion is employed to deal with the nonlinearities and the high-order terms of the linearization errors are estimated. The purpose of the addressed state estimation problem is to design a time-varying state estimator such that, in the presence of the missing measurements and the random disturbances, an upper bound of the estimation error covariance can be guaranteed and the explicit expression of the estimator parameters is given. By using the Riccati-like difference equations approach, the estimator parameter is characterized by the solutions to two Riccati-like difference equations. It is shown that the obtained upper bound is minimized by the designed estimator parameters and the proposed state estimation algorithm is of a recursive form suitable for online computation. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed state estimation scheme. }}

The complex network as well as discrete element methods (DEM) is adopted, in which the contact network and the force network are mainly considered. Comparing the contact network to the microstructure evolution, we find that pores always form in a large contact polygon. In the force network, the normal contact forces distribute extremely non-uniform. An interesting phenomenon is that a ring-like structure of force chain emerges spontaneously in the sintering force networks, whose life expectance is much longer than other linear force chains. Furthermore, a high contact force is more likely to form at a new contact site. To our knowledge, it is the first time to study force distributions and microstructure evolutions in sintering from the complex network point of view, which should be a promising method for further investigating the complex sintering process in the future. }}

Combining the heterogeneous mean-field theory with simulations, we show that there exist four regions with distinct nucleation scenarios depending on the values of h and λ : the system undergoes a two-step nucleation process from − 1 configuration to 0 configuration and then to 1 configuration (region I); nucleation becomes a one-step process without an intermediate metastable configuration directly from − 1 configuration to 1 configuration (region II(1)) or directly from 0 configuration to 1 configuration (region II(2)) depending on the sign of λ ; the metastability of the system vanishes and nucleation is thus irrelevant (region III). Furthermore, we show that in the region I nucleation rates for each step intersect that results in the occurrence of a maximum in the total nucleation rate. }}

A novel concept of H ∞ cluster synchronization is proposed to quantify against the exogenous disturbance of the complex networks. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, H ∞ cluster synchronization criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The solvability of derived conditions depends not only on the attenuation level but also the initial values of complex networks. The H ∞ state estimation is studied for the same complex networks with the purpose of designing a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements.

Previous approaches basically applied to community detection on time static networks and thus failed to consider the potentially crucial and useful information latently embedded in the dynamic structure evolution process of time-dependent network. To address these problems and to tackle the network non-scalability dilemma, we propose the dynamic hierarchical method for detecting and revealing structure evolution schematic of the time-dependent network. In practice and specificity, we propose an explicit hierarchical network evolution uncovering algorithm framework originated from and widely expanded from time-dependent and dynamic spectral optimization theory. Our method yields preferable results compared with previous approaches on a vast variety of test network data, including both real on-line networks and computer generated complex networks. }}

The hidden source can be localized based on the information gathered by a few nodes, which are called the observers. Identification of the efficient observers is critical to locate the source with high accuracy. Here we analyze several placement strategies of the observers based on centralities of nodes, including the high-degree, high-betweenness, high-clustering coefficient, high-eigenvector and high-closeness. Based on the random spreading experiments on both model and real networks, we find that the localization accuracy of these strategies is decreased with the increase of the connectivity of network, and there is no significant difference between them. Further experiments show that the coverage range of the observers may be the key factor that affects the localization accuracy. Our results can provide a route for the optimal design of placement strategies of the observer nodes. }}

An active susceptible node can be infected by all its infected neighbors, while an inactive susceptible node can only be infected by its active infected neighbors. By means of ​mean-field approach and numerical simulations, we explore the critical phenomenon by the combined effects of activity rate and infection rate on spreading dynamics. We show that the critical threshold of infection rate is increased by node activity, and node activity also shows a critical phenomenon given certain infection rate. On the whole, there exists a critical curve consists of pairs of critical activity rate and infection rate. We also analyze theoretically the impact of activity rate and infection rate on the final size of spreading dynamics, which is verified by numerical simulations. This work complements our understanding of spreading dynamics with active nodes and may be used to develop more feasible and more economical methods to control spreading dynamics. }}

The presented method integrates complex networks, community division, and fuzzy mean operator (FMO). The whole sequences are divided into potential domain regions by the complex network and community division, and \{FMO\} allows the final determination for the domain position. This method will suffice to predict regions that will form a domain structure and those that are unstructured based on completely new atomic coordinate information of the query sequence, and be able to separate different domains in the same query sequence from each other. On evaluating the performance using an independent testing dataset, PPM-Dom reached 91.41% for prediction accuracy, 96.12% for sensitivity and 92.86% for specificity.

In this context, the robustness of network infrastructures, e.g. air transport networks, are a central issue in transport geography. Disruption of communication links by intentional causes (e.g., terrorist attack on an airport) or unintentional (e.g., weather inclemency) could be crucial for countries, regions and even the airlines affected themselves. Policymakers and the management of airlines and alliances should be able to reduce the effects of such interruptions in order to ensure good communication through air transport (i.e., maximize the robustness of their network at a reasonable cost). The literature review of the study of air transport route networks through an analysis of complex networks has highlighted a lack of contributions to the study of the topology and the robustness of such networks which contrasts, with advances undertaken for other transport networks or communication systems. This survey suggests areas in which research should be undertaken, based on the existing literature in other areas and from three different perspectives: global route networks, airline alliances, airlines and airports so as to help towards a better understanding of air traffic and, therefore, to be able to assess the potential damage of any airport being inoperative for a continent, country or airline. }}

The obtained results suggest that the exponential of the Minkowski distance is the most suitable metric to quantify the similarities between pairs of objects. In addition, the community identification method based on the greedy optimization provides the best cluster solution.

This paper proposes a novel algorithm based on local similarity to detect the community structure in complex network. Firstly, a new similarity index between nodes is defined to model the topological closeness of local connections in networks. Then nodes sharing high similarity are gathered to form the community structure. The results suggest the emergence of the bridging nodes and kernels within the community detection process. This proposed method performs well when it is introduced to seek out the actual community structure, kernels and bridging nodes in some benchmark networks. Thirdly, the proposed algorithm lends itself to many applications, such as detecting communities in several \{IEEE\} standard power grids and investigating the roles of bridging nodes in cascading failures. Experimentally, the proposed algorithm outperforms some other similarity indices and clustering methods. Finally, a detailed comparison helps us get the conclusion that the traditional label propagation algorithm is a special case of the proposed algorithm. }}

However, in many cases it is sufficient to control just a part of nodes. Because a community usually plays an independent role in a real complex system, the paper discusses a strategy to control target communities of a complex network. First, the paper shows that the process of controlling target communities will be influenced by their connections with the remainder of the network. Therefore, it is necessary to block the control signals transmitting through these interconnections. Second, the paper proposes a new kind of control nodes that selectively block signal transmissions, termed immune nodes. The immune nodes work along with the driver nodes to facilitate the control of target communities, even if the entire topology of a network is absent. Third, we propose a method to reduce the total number of driver nodes and control nodes by deliberately arranging the matching sequence of nodes. The experiments are carried out on a series of model networks and 11 real networks. The experimental results show that the absolute control cost of controlling communities is less than that of controlling the entire network, when the average degree of the network is low, but the ratio of immune nodes and driver nodes to all nodes increases. }}

In the real world, the probability of a node to be infected is varying with the network environment; the prior model is not suitable for this scenario. In this paper, we consider an actual epidemic spreading model in which the probability of a node to be infected is related with the number of the infected nodes among its neighbors. We develop an analytical model for this epidemic spreading, named environment aware \{SIS\} model (EA-SIS) considering the heterogeneous infection rates, and analytically investigate the epidemic spreading in complex networks. We find that the threshold of EA-SIS is smaller than \{SIS\} which means the virus is easier to spread out in the EA-SIS model. In addition, we study several existing immune strategies on the EA-SIS model and propose a novel immune strategy which is based on expected infection time, ETB, of the nodes around the infected nodes for EA-SIS. The simulation results show that the EA-SIS model is more efficient that the \{SIS\} model, also, the proposed immune strategy, ETB, is more effective than the local information method and is close to the target immune strategy. }}

Firstly, according to the characteristics of guitar tablature, six chord networks of popular songs by six pop singers are constructed and the properties of all networks are concluded. By analyzing the diverse chord networks, the accompaniment regulations and features are shown, with which the chords can be generated automatically. Secondly, in terms of the characteristics of popular songs, a two-tiered network containing a verse network and a chorus network is constructed. With this network, the verse and chorus can be composed respectively with the random walk algorithm. Thirdly, the musical motif is considered for generating chords, with which the bad chord progressions can be revised. This method can make the accompaniments sound more melodious. Finally, a popular song is chosen for generating chords and the new generated accompaniment sounds better than those done by the composers. }}

We perform complex network analysis on multiple instances of the network, looking for correlations between estimated damages and betweenness centrality indices, attempting to determine which model is best suited to predict features of our network. }}

The numerical result shows that the cascading failure propagation in directed complex networks is highly dependent on the attack strategies and the directionality of the network, as well as other network configurations. }}

Especially, research on biological networks like functional spatiotemporal brain activations and changes, caused by neuropsychiatric pathologies, is promising. Analyzing those so-called complex networks, the calculation of meaningful measures can be very long-winded depending on their size and structure. Even worse, in many labs only standard desktop computers are accessible to perform those calculations. Numerous investigations on complex networks regard huge but sparsely connected network structures, where most network nodes are connected to only a few others. Currently, there are several libraries available to tackle this kind of networks. A problem arises when not only a few big and sparse networks have to be analyzed, but hundreds or thousands of smaller and conceivably dense networks (e.g. in measuring brain activation over time). Then every minute per network is crucial. For these cases there several possibilities to use standard hardware more efficiently. It is not sufficient to apply just standard algorithms for dense graph characteristics. This article introduces the new library \{FALCON\} developed especially for the exploration of dense complex networks. Currently, it offers 12 different measures (like clustering coefficients), each for undirected-unweighted, undirected-weighted and directed-unweighted networks. It uses a multi-core approach in combination with comprehensive code and hardware optimizations. There is an alternative massively parallel \{GPU\} implementation for the most time-consuming measures, too. Finally, a comparing benchmark is integrated to support the choice of the most suitable library for a particular network issue. }}

To investigate the effects of interactions between two rumors under symmetric conditions, we built a model based on an ordinary differential equation system while assuming that each individual’s spreading rate after receiving one rumor depends on whether he/she knows the other rumor. In certain cases, two rumors accelerate the spread of each other, while in a portion of the other cases they impede or decelerate the spread of each other. We discuss these effects by dividing the total population into nine groups that correspond to nine states, and we subsequently build the mean-field equations for the two-rumor interaction based on the \{SIR\} model in a homogeneous complex network, and we find their numerical solution with varying interaction factors for the rates of spreading and becoming disinterested. The results show that when we change these interaction factors, the density curves of the nine states and their maximum values will change accordingly by a series of rules, which demonstrates the corresponding effects when there is a positive or negative interaction between the two rumors. Our work could establish a foundation for further study of this issue. }}

In this paper, we find that the classic Dijkstra's algorithm can be improved by simple modification. We propose a fast algorithm which utilize the preiously-calculated results to accelerate the latter calculation. Simple optimization strategies are also proposed with consideration of characteristics of scale-free complex networks. Our experimental results show that the average running time of our algorithm is lower than the Dijkstra's algorithm by a factor relating to the connection probability in random networks of \{ER\} model. The performance of our algorithm is significantly better than the Dijkstra's algorithm in scale-free networks generated by the \{AB\} model. The results show that the time complexity is reduced to about O(n2.4) in scalefree complex networks. When the optimization strategies are applied, the algorithm performance is further improved slightly in scale-free networks. }}

It is shown that, unless a certain minimal coherent topology is present in the network, synchronization is always preserved. While for a minimal network where synchronization is global, the resulting synchrony reduces to semi-global if redundant connections are added. }}

But how effective are these models to capture their real performance response is still a question worthy of research. Taking the Chinese railway system as an example, this paper selects three typical complex network based models, including purely topological model (PTM), purely shortest path model (PSPM), and weight (link length) based shortest path model (WBSPM), to analyze railway accessibility and flow-based vulnerability and compare their results with those from the real train flow model (RTFM). The results show that the \{WBSPM\} can produce the train routines with 83% stations and 77% railway links identical to the real routines and can approach the \{RTFM\} the best for railway vulnerability under both single and multiple component failures. The correlation coefficient for accessibility vulnerability from \{WBSPM\} and \{RTFM\} under single station failures is 0.96 while it is 0.92 for flow-based vulnerability; under multiple station failures, where each station has the same failure probability fp, the \{WBSPM\} can produce almost identical vulnerability results with those from the \{RTFM\} under almost all failures scenarios when fp is larger than 0.62 for accessibility vulnerability and 0.86 for flow-based vulnerability. }}

The mixed time-delays are composed of discrete and distributed delays, both of which are mode-dependent. The nonlinearities imbedded with the complex networks are assumed to satisfy the sector condition that is more general than the commonly used Lipschitz condition. By making use of the Kronecker product and the stochastic analysis tool, we propose a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional suitable for handling distributed delays and then show that the addressed synchronization problem is solvable if a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. Therefore, a unified \{LMI\} approach is developed to establish sufficient conditions for the coupled complex network to be globally exponentially synchronized in the mean square. Note that the \{LMIs\} can be easily solved by using the Matlab \{LMI\} toolbox and no tuning of parameters is required. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the main results obtained. }}

abstract = {Abstract Controllability of complex networks has been one of the attractive research areas for both network and control community, and has yielded many promising and significant results in minimum inputs and minimum driver vertices. However, few studies have been devoted to studying the minimum controlled vertex set through which control over the network with arbitrary structure can be achieved. In this paper, we prove that the minimum driver vertices driven by different inputs are not sufficient to ensure the full control of the network when the associated graph contains the inaccessible strongly connected component which has perfect matching and propose an algorithm to identify a minimum controlled vertex set for network with arbitrary structure using convenient graph and mathematical tools. And the simulation results show that the controllability of network is correlated to the number of inaccessible strongly connected components which have perfect matching and these results promote us to better understand the relationship between the network’s structural characteristics and its control. }}

In this paper, we analyze Linux Operating System (LOS) as a complex network via modeling functions as nodes and function calls as edges. It is found that for the \{LOS\} network and modularized components within it, the out-degree follows an exponential distribution and the in-degree follows a power-law distribution. For better understanding the underlying design principles of LOS, we explore the coupling correlations of components in \{LOS\} from aspects of topology and function. The result shows that the component for device drivers has a strong manifestation in topology while a weak manifestation in function. However, the component for process management shows the contrary phenomenon. Moreover, in an effort to investigate the impact of system failures on networks, we make a comparison between the networks traced from normal and failure status of LOS. This leads to a conclusion that the failure will change function calls which should be executed in normal status and introduce new function calls in the meanwhile. }}

The recently proposed Cannistrai–Alanis–Ravai (CAR) index shows the power of local link/triangle information in improving link-prediction accuracy. Inspired by the idea of employing local link/triangle information, we propose a new similarity index with more local structure information. In our method, local link/triangle structure information can be conveyed by clustering coefficient of common-neighbors directly. The reason why clustering coefficient has good effectiveness in estimating the contribution of a common-neighbor is that it employs links existing between neighbors of a common-neighbor and these links have the same structural position with the candidate link to this common-neighbor. In our experiments, three estimators: precision, \{AUP\} and \{AUC\} are used to evaluate the accuracy of link prediction algorithms. Experimental results on ten tested networks drawn from various fields show that our new index is more effective in predicting missing links than \{CAR\} index, especially for networks with low correlation between number of common-neighbors and number of links between common-neighbors. }}

A case from the Qinghai Salt Lake Ecological Industrial Park is introduced to construct the network topological structure and simulate the network cascading failure transmission. We discuss how two types of node enterprises impact the stability of the eco-industrial system. The results show how various node enterprises with different mechanisms affect the systematic stability of the eco-industrial network and how the removal of core node enterprises can lead to greater damage to the network. Managers of eco-industrial systems should focus on structural core enterprises and core industrial chains. In this paper, the managerial implications can provide reliable guidance for stable operations in an eco-industrial system. }}

A novel scheme is proposed to predict \{AF\} by using multi-threshold spectra of the recurrence complex network. Firstly, epicardial signals are transformed into the recurrence complex network to quantify structural properties of the recurrence in the phase space. Spectral parameters with multi-threshold are used to characterize the global structure of the network. Then the feature sequential forward searching algorithm and mutual information based Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy criterion are used to find the optimal feature set. Finally, a support vector machine is used to predict the occurrence of AF. This method is assessed on the pre-AF epicardial signals of canine which includes the normal group A (no further \{AF\} will happen), the mild group B (the following \{AF\} time is less than 180 s) and the severe group C (the following \{AF\} time is more than 180 s). 25 optimal features are selected out of 180 features from each sample. With these features, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 99.40%, 99.70% and 99.60%, respectively, which are the best among the recurrence based methods. The results suggest that the proposed method can predict \{AF\} accurately and thus can be prospectively used in the postoperative evaluation. }}

Some effective control schemes are designed under which the whole network is globally asymptotically synchronized to an arbitrary objective trajectory. By imposing the open-loop control on the whole network together with the feedback control only on a small fraction of the nodes, an easy-to-verify sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the asymptotic synchronization of the complex network under study. Furthermore, to decrease the feedback control gains, the idea of adaptive control scheme is combined together, and the verified conditions are further weakened. Finally, by introducing the impulses to the open-loop network and using the improved Halanay inequality, other novel synchronization criteria are developed for the complex network. Comparisons of the obtained theoretical results as well as the detail pinning schemes are also given. Numerical examples of the undirected scale-free network and the directed small-world network are illustrated to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed theoretical results. }}

In order to detect communities more accurately and reasonably, a novel algorithm is proposed based on cosine distance and core-node in this paper. Cosine distances between nodes are regarded as their similarity measure and network node vectors can be extracted directly from the similarity matrix without calculating eigenvectors. Core-nodes as the initial communities are found by cosine distance threshold and degree threshold. Furthermore, the initial communities are expanded by adding other nodes with the nearest cosine distance to core-nodes. Through changing degree and cosine distance thresholds constantly, the optimal community structure of complex networks can be obtained by optimizing modularity with high accuracy. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. }}

However, the existing link prediction methods are unsatisfactory for processing topological information and have high time complexity. This paper presents a novel method of Link Prediction with Community Structure (LPCS) based on hyperbolic mapping. Different from the existing link prediction methods, to utilize global structure information of the network, \{LPCS\} deals with the network from an overall perspective. \{LPCS\} takes full advantage of the community structure and its hierarchical organization to map networks into hyperbolic space, and obtains the hyperbolic coordinates which depict the global structure information of the network, then uses hyperbolic distance to describe the similarity between the nodes, finally predicts missing links according to the degree of the similarity between unconnected node pairs. The combination of the hyperbolic geometry framework and the community structure makes \{LPCS\} perform well in predicting missing links, and the time complexity of \{LPCS\} is linear, which makes \{LPCS\} can be applied to handle large scale networks in acceptable time. \{LPCS\} outperforms many state-of-the-art link prediction methods in the networks obeying power-law degree distribution. }}

The alteration of view angle modifies the \{PNVG\} and its properties such as the average node degree, average link length of the graph as well as cluster quantity of built graph, etc. We calculated and analyzed different \{PNVG\} properties depending on the view angle for different types of the time series such as the random (uncorrelated, correlated and fractal) and cardiac rhythm time series for healthy and ill patients. Investigation of different \{PNVG\} properties shows that the view angle gives a new approach to characterize the structure of the time series that are invisible in the conventional version of the algorithm. It is also shown that the \{PNVG\} approach allows us to distinguish, identify and describe in detail various time series. }}

The experimental results on a number of benchmark networks show the effectiveness of this method and the evolution of network topology is captured. Furthermore, we explore how network structure affects its controllability and find that the sparser a network is, the more control nodes are needed to control it and the larger the differences between node degrees, the more control nodes are needed to achieve the full control. Our framework provides an alternative to controllability optimization and can be applied to arbitrary networks without any limitations. }}

The uneven distribution of the production and consumption of fossil fuel makes the fossil fuel flows between countries by international trade. This study aims to quantitatively analyse the features and evolution of the international trade of fossil fuel by complex network and emergy. We transform the trade quantity of coal, crude oil and natural gas into emergy by transformity and the sum of the three emergies is the emergy of fossil fuel. The complex network models of the integrated fossil fuel trade as well as the trade of coal, crude oil and natural gas are built up based on the value of emergy. We analyse the trade relationships, trade quantity, trade density, and hierarchy structure of the networks. We find that the number of trade relationships and the trade quantities follow the power law distribution; countries with many export relationships tend to have many import relationships; the centralization of trade quantity is becoming more intense for fossil fuel, crude oil and coal, but less intense for natural gas; the pattern of top relationships is diversified; the trade density of fossil fuel is increasing; and countries with more than 20 trade relationships tend to have a hierarchy structure. Our findings implicate that as the hierarchy structure is becoming more ordered, the statuses of the countries are clearer, and thus it is easier for policy makers to identify the roles of their own countries or the roles of other countries. Coal is the “cheapest” fuel measuring by “energy cost” and is the most widely traded type of fossil fuel. When two countries exchange fossil fuel and money in the international trade, they should look further into the energy cost of them and reconsider the effectiveness of the trade. Our study can also reveal the trade strategy of the countries. }}

The detection of communities has great significance for understanding the function and organization of networks. Generally, community detection can be formulated as a modularity optimization problem. However, traditional modularity optimization based algorithms have the resolution limit that they may fail to find communities which are smaller than a certain size. In this paper, we propose a cellular learning automata based algorithm for detecting communities in complex networks. Our algorithm models the whole network as an irregular cellular learning automata (ICLA) and reveals the optimal community structure through the evolution of the cellular learning automata. By interacting with both the global and local environments, our algorithm effectively solves the resolution limit problem of modularity optimization. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our algorithm is effective and efficient at detecting community structure in complex networks. }}

This paper designed a complex network approach for examining the dynamics of the co-movement between crude oil futures and spot prices. We defined the co-movement modes by a coarse-graining procedure and analyzed the transformation characteristics between the modes by weighted complex network models and evolutionary models. We analyzed the parameters of these models by using the West Texas Intermediate crude oil future prices and the Daqing (China) crude oil spot prices from November 25, 2002 to March 22, 2011 as sample data. The results indicate that the co-movement modes of the crude oil futures and spot prices are clustered around a few critical modes during the evolution. The co-movement of the crude oil prices has the characteristic of grouping, and the conversion of the co-movement modes requires an average of 5–7 days. There are some important transitional phases in the evolution of prices, and the results validate the current trend of rising oil prices. This research may provide information for the oil price decision-making process, and more importantly, provides a new approach for examining the co-movement between variables. }}

abstract = {Abstract Studying the evolutionary community structure in complex networks is crucial for uncovering the links between structures and functions of a given community. Most contemporary community detection algorithms employs single optimization criteria (i.e.., modularity), which may not be adequate to represent the structures in complex networks. We suggest community detection process as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) for investigating the community structures in complex networks. To overcome the limitations of the community detection problem, we propose a new multi-objective optimization algorithm based on enhanced firefly algorithm so that a set of non-dominated (Pareto-optimal) solutions can be achieved. In our proposed algorithm, a new tuning parameter based on a chaotic mechanism and novel self-adaptive probabilistic mutation strategies are used to improve the overall performance of the algorithm. The experimental results on synthetic and real world complex networks suggest that the multi-objective community detection algorithm provides useful paradigm for discovering overlapping community structures robustly. }}

First, based on fluctuation features of \{RMB\} exchange rate, we define the first type of fluctuation mode as one specific foreign currency against \{RMB\} in four days’ fluctuating situations, and the second type as four different foreign currencies against \{RMB\} in one day’s fluctuating situation. With the transforming method, we construct the unique-currency and multi-currency complex networks. Further, through analyzing the topological features including out-degree, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of fluctuation-mode complex networks, we find that the out-degree distribution of both types of fluctuation mode basically follows power-law distributions with exponents between 1 and 2. The further analysis reveals that the out-degree and the clustering coefficient generally obey the approximated negative correlation. With this result, we confirm previous observations showing that the \{RMB\} exchange rate exhibits a characteristic of long-range memory. Finally, we analyze the most probable transmission route of fluctuation modes, and provide probability prediction matrix. The transmission route for \{RMB\} exchange rate fluctuation modes exhibits the characteristics of partially closed loop, repeat and reversibility, which lays a solid foundation for predicting \{RMB\} exchange rate fluctuation patterns with large volume of data. }}

In this paper, based on the theory of asymptotic stability of linear time-delay systems, synchronization stability in complex dynamical networks with coupling delays is investigated, and we derive novel criteria of synchronization state for both delay-independent and delay-dependent stabilities. As illustrative examples, we use the networks with coupling delays and a given coupling scheme to test the theoretical results. }}

The correlation between the bivariate time series fluctuates over time. The transmission among the correlation modes exhibits a multiscale phenomenon, which provides richer information. To investigate the multiscale transmission of the correlation modes, this paper describes a hybrid model integrating wavelet analysis and complex network theory to decompose and reconstruct the original bivariate time series into sequences in a joint time–frequency domain and defined the correlation modes at each time–frequency domain. We chose the crude oil spot and futures prices as the sample data. The empirical results indicate that the main duration of volatility (32–64 days) for the strongly positive correlation between the crude oil spot price and the futures price provides more useful information for investors. Moreover, the weighted degree, weighted indegree and weighted outdegree of the correlation modes follow power-law distributions. The correlation fluctuation strengthens the extent of persistence over the long term, whereas persistence weakens over the short and medium term. The primary correlation modes dominating the transmission process and the major intermediary modes in the transmission process are clustered both in the short and long term. }}

Similar to the sampled data control systems, we convert the discrete time coupling issue into an effective time-varying delayed coupling network. By constructing the Lyapunov function skillfully, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the realization of the synchronization pattern for all initial values based on the Lyapunov stability theorem and linear matrix inequalities. What is more, the maximum allowable sampling period for communication is obtained through a optimization problem. Numerical simulations are also exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the main result. }}

We applied the \{NCON\} model to different topological networks and studied the formation of opinion clusters. In the case of random graphs, random regular networks, and scale-free (SF) networks, we found that the system moved from a continuous phase transition to a discontinuous phase transition as the connectivity density and exponent of the \{SF\} network λ ​decreased and increased in the steady state, respectively. Moreover, the initial proportions of neutral opinions were found to have little effect on the proportional structure of opinions at the steady state. These results suggest that the majority choice between positive and negative opinions depends on the initial proportion of each opinion. The \{NCON\} model may have potential applications for decision makers. }}

Based on this event, and real observations of the complex network changes, an algorithm is proposed in which evolution of a network is accomplished using preferential and random attachments of edges, while the number of nodes is fixed. Evolution of clustering coefficients and number of edges display similar patterns observed in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities.

According to the radical kinetic scheme, a simulation system of the ethylene cracking process has been developed include the feedstock reconstruction model, detailed kinetic schemes generator, and the reactor simulation model. As the complex networks research has grown steadily for its potential to represent, characterize and model a wide range of intricate natural systems and phenomena, a modified PageRank algorithm is applied to represent the topological structure and dynamic system characteristic of \{ECR\} networks. As a result, the hubs and authorities in reaction networks are illustrated by the algorithm and correction coefficients derived from these hubs is applied in detailed kinetic schemes generator. The product yield the adjusted model predicted is verified in an industrial case of naphtha pyrolysis process which shows a reasonable match with the industrial data. Furthermore, the simplification of kinetic scheme by PageRank algorithm has also shown in this case. }}

A kind of event which avoids continuous communication between neighboring nodes is designed to drive the controller update of each node. The advantage of the event-triggering strategy is the significant decrease of the number of controller updates for synchronization task of complex networks involving embedded microprocessors with limited on-board resources. To describe the system’s ability reaching synchronization, a concept about generalized algebraic connectivity is introduced for strongly connected networks and then extended to the strongly connected components of the directed network containing a directed spanning tree. Two sufficient conditions are presented to reveal the underlying relationships of corresponding parameters to reach global synchronization based on algebraic graph, matrix theory and Lyapunov control method. A positive lower bound for inter-event times is derived to guarantee the absence of Zeno behavior. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the theoretical results. }}

abstract = {Abstract Quantification of symmetries in complex networks is typically done globally in terms of automorphisms. Extending previous methods to locally assess the symmetry of nodes is not straightforward. Here we present a new framework to quantify the symmetries around nodes, which we call connectivity patterns. We develop two topological transformations that allow a concise characterization of the different types of symmetry appearing on networks and apply these concepts to six network models, namely the Erdős–Rényi, Barabási–Albert, random geometric graph, Waxman, Voronoi and rewired Voronoi. Real-world networks, namely the scientific areas of Wikipedia, the world-wide airport network and the street networks of Oldenburg and San Joaquin, are also analyzed in terms of the proposed symmetry measurements. Several interesting results emerge from this analysis, including the high symmetry exhibited by the Erdős–Rényi model. Additionally, we found that the proposed measurements present low correlation with other traditional metrics, such as node degree and betweenness centrality. Principal component analysis is used to combine all the results, revealing that the concepts presented here have substantial potential to also characterize networks at a global scale. We also provide a real-world application to the financial market network. }}

In particular, the model considers the linear combination of three possible routes of disease propagation between infected and susceptible individuals as well as two possible transmission types which describe how the susceptible vectors attack the infected individuals. A new technique based on the basic reproduction matrix is introduced to obtain the following results. First, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the global stability of the model through a unified approach. As a result, we are able to produce the exact basic reproduction number and the precise epidemic thresholds with respect to three spreading strengths, the curing strength or the immunization strength all at once. Second, the monotonicity of the basic reproduction number and the above mentioned epidemic thresholds with respect to all other parameters can be rigorously characterized. Finally, we are able to compare the effectiveness of various immunization strategies under the assumption that the number of persons getting vaccinated is the same for all strategies. In particular, we prove that in the scale-free networks, both targeted and acquaintance immunizations are more effective than uniform and active immunizations and that active immunization is the least effective strategy among those four. We are also able to determine how the vaccine should be used at minimum to control the outbreak of the disease. }}

abstract = {Abstract Recently an increasing amount of research is devoted to the question of how the most influential nodes (seeds) can be found effectively in a complex network. There are a number of measures proposed for this purpose, for instance, high-degree centrality measure reflects the importance of the network topology and has a reasonable runtime performance to find a set of nodes with highest degree, but they do not have a satisfactory dissemination potentiality in the network due to having many common neighbors ( \{CN\} ( 1 ) ) and common neighbors of neighbors ( \{CN\} ( 2 ) ). This flaw holds in other measures as well. In this paper, we compare high-degree centrality measure with other well-known measures using ten datasets in order to find a proportion for the common seeds in the seed sets obtained by them. We, thereof, propose an improved high-degree centrality measure (named DegreeDistance) and improve it to enhance accuracy in two phases, \{FIDD\} and SIDD, by put a threshold on the number of common neighbors of already-selected seed nodes and a non-seed node which is under investigation to be selected as a seed as well as considering the influence score of seed nodes directly or through their common neighbors over the non-seed node. To evaluate the accuracy and runtime performance of DegreeDistance, FIDD, and SIDD, they are applied to eight large-scale networks and it finally turns out that \{SIDD\} dramatically outperforms other well-known measures and evinces comparatively more accurate performance in identifying the most influential nodes. }}

Milk type affected the fat content and color parameters of kishk samples. Multi-scale exploration of kishk microstructure revealed a complex network of macroconstituents (milk protein and wheat starch) embedded in a thick layer of fat. The mechanism of kishk rehydration was then exploited by analyzing the water sorption isotherms and observing the morphometric changes in the particles of this powder subjected to different relative humidities. From powder rheology measurements, kishk showed an intermediate flowability behavior and cohesiveness, associated to its high fat content as a binder between the particles. }}

We demonstrate this fact on the clustering coefficient. We propose eight new infinite classes of complex networks. One of these new classes is so rich that it is parametrized by three independent parameters. }}

The k-shell index, which is the topological location of a node in a network, is a more efficient measure at capturing the spreading ability of a node than are the degree and betweenness centralities. However, the k-shell decomposition fails to yield the monotonic ranking of spreaders because it assigns too many nodes with the same k-shell index. In this paper, we propose a novel measure, coreness centrality, to estimate the spreading influence of a node in a network using the k-shell indices of its neighbors. Our experimental results on both real and artificial networks, compared with an epidemic spreading model, show that the proposed method can quantify the node influence more accurately and provide a more monotonic ranking list than other ranking methods. }}

Complex networks involving proteins of the chitin metabolic pathway in extant organisms were constructed based on protein sequence similarity. Several usual network indices were estimated in order to obtain information on the topology of these networks, including those related to higher order neighborhood properties. Due to the assumed evolutionary character of the system, we also discuss issues related to modularity properties, with the concept of edge betweenness playing a particularly important role in our analysis. Complex network approach correctly identifies clusters of organisms that belong to phylogenetic groups without any a priori knowledge about the biological features of the investigated protein sequences.

In a classical ESN, its dynamic reservoir (DR) has a sparse and random topology, but the performance of \{ESN\} with its \{DR\} taking another kind of topology is still unknown. So based on complex network theory, three new \{ESNs\} are proposed and investigated in this paper. The small-world topology, scale-free topology and the mixed topology of small-world effect and scale-free feature are considered in these new ESNs. We studied the relationship between \{DR\} architecture and prediction capability. In our simulation experiments, we used two widely used time series to test the prediction performance among the new \{ESNs\} and classical ESN, and used the independent identically distributed (i.i.d) time series to analyze the short-term memory (STM) capability. We answer the following questions: What are the differences of these \{ESNs\} in the prediction performance? Can the spectral radius of the internal weights matrix be wider? What is the short-term memory capability? The experimental results show that the proposed new \{ESNs\} have better prediction performance, wider spectral radius and almost the same \{STM\} capacity as classical ESN's. }}

Then, by constructing a Lyapunov functional and using Jensen's inequality, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure the exponential stability of the resulting delayed differential equation.

The \{CF\} method with a new evaluation criterion for the vertex combination degree is designed to select the typical cases from the constructed communities, and a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) based strategy with multi-similarity threshold is proposed in the case retrieval process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a number of comparative simulations by using the real-world data coming from a copper–molybdenum concentration plant are carried out, and the results indicate that the proposed method can provide a good measure quality for the industrial application. }}

Our result shows: The basic network features change little during research period. Industries that have most embodied energy flows changes from oil related industries to coal related industries. Two kinds of industries have the power to control other industries: industries with most weighted embodied flows and industries have close relationship with people's daily life. }}

Then, using such a dissimilarity measure in conjunction with a hierarchical clustering method, our extracting method is proposed. The performance of our approach is tested on a set of computer generated and real-world networks with known hierarchical organization. The results demonstrate that our method enables us to offer insight into the complex networks with a multi-scale description.

We systematically carried out gas–liquid two-phase flow experiments for measuring the time series of flow signals, which is studied in terms of the mapping from time series to complex networks. In particular, we construct directed weighted complex networks (DWCN) from time series and then associate different aspects of chaotic dynamics with the topological indices of the \{DWCN\} and further demonstrate that the \{DWCN\} can be exploited to detect unstable periodic orbits of low periods. Examples using time series from classical chaotic systems are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We construct and analyze numbers of \{DWCNs\} for different gas–liquid flow patterns and find that our approach can quantitatively distinguish different experimental gas–liquid flow patterns. Furthermore, the \{DWCN\} analysis indicates that slug flow shows obvious chaotic behavior and its unstable periodic orbits reflect the intermittent quasi-periodic oscillation behavior between liquid slug and large gas slug. These interesting and significant findings suggest that the directed weighted complex network can potentially be a powerful tool for uncovering the underlying dynamics leading to the formation of the gas–liquid slug flow. }}

abstract = {Rücker's walk count (WC) indices are well-known topological indices (TIs) used in Chemoinformatics to quantify the molecular structure of drugs represented by a graph in Quantitative structure–activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) studies. In this work, we introduce for the first time the higher-order (kth order) analogues (WCk) of these indices using Markov chains. In addition, we report new \{QSPR\} models for large complex networks of different Bio-Systems useful in Parasitology and Neuroinformatics. The new type of \{QSPR\} models can be used for model checking to calculate numerical scores S(Lij) for links Lij (checking or re-evaluation of network connectivity) in large networks of all these fields. The method may be summarized as follows: (i) first, the WCk(j) values are calculated for all jth nodes in a complex network already created; (ii) A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to seek a linear equation that discriminates connected or linked (Lij = 1) pairs of nodes experimentally confirmed from non-linked ones (Lij = 0); (iii) The new model is validated with external series of pairs of nodes; (iv) The equation obtained is used to re-evaluate the connectivity quality of the network, connecting/disconnecting nodes based on the quality scores calculated with the new connectivity function. The linear \{QSPR\} models obtained yielded the following results in terms of overall test accuracy for re-construction of complex networks of different Bio-Systems: parasite–host networks (93.14%), \{NW\} Spain fasciolosis spreading networks (71.42/70.18%) and CoCoMac Brain Cortex co-activation network (86.40%). Thus, this work can contribute to the computational re-evaluation or model checking of connectivity (collation) in complex systems of any science field. }}

In this paper, we design a greedy link removal algorithm and find that many links in networks are actually redundant for synchronization, i.e. the synchronizability of the network is hardly affected if these links are removed. Our analysis shows that homogeneous networks generally have more redundant links than heterogeneous networks. We denote the reduced network with the minimum number of links to preserve synchronizability (eigenratio of the Laplacian matrix) of the original network as the synchronization backbone. Simulating the Kuramoto model, we confirm that the network synchronizability is effectively preserved in the backbone. Moreover, the topological properties of the original network and backbone are compared in detail. }}

To capture the effect of the link directionality and link weight asymmetry, the heterogeneity indexes of complex networks and the traffic flow model are introduced. The numerical results show that the critical value of heterogeneity determines congestion transition processes. The congestion degree increases with heterogeneity when the network heterogeneity is at a subcritical region. A network is more tolerant of congestion if the heterogeneity of the network is smaller or larger than the critical value. Furthermore, when heterogeneity reaches the critical value, the average number of accumulated vehicles arrives at the maximum and the traffic flow is under a serious congestion state. A significant improvement on the tolerance to congestion of traffic networks can be made if the network heterogeneity is controlled within a reasonable range. }}

abstract = {Abstract The northwest Australian summer monsoon owes a notable degree of its interannual variability to interactions with other regional monsoon systems. Therefore, changes in the nature of these relationships may contribute to variability in monsoon strength over longer time scales. Previous attempts to evaluate how proxy records from the Indonesian–Australian monsoon region correspond to other records from the Indian and East Asian monsoon regions, as well as to El Niño-related proxy records, have been qualitative, relying on ‘curve-fitting’ methods. Here, we seek a quantitative approach for identifying coupling relationships between paleoclimate proxy records, employing statistical techniques to compute the interdependence of two paleoclimate time series. We verify the use of complex networks to identify coupling relationships between modern climate indices. This method is then extended to a set of paleoclimate proxy records from the Asian, Australasian and South American regions spanning the past 9000 years. The resulting networks demonstrate the existence of coupling relationships between regional monsoon systems on millennial time scales, but also highlight the transient nature of teleconnections during this period. In the context of the northwest Australian summer monsoon, we recognise a shift in coupling relationships from strong interhemispheric links with East Asian and ITCZ-related proxy records in the mid-Holocene to significantly weaker coupling in the later Holocene. Although the identified links cannot explain the underlying physical processes leading to coupling between regional monsoon systems, this method provides a step towards understanding the role that changes in teleconnections play in millennial-to orbital-scale climate variability. }}

The result shows that there are no dominant venture capital firms in China which act as hubs in the \{VC\} network, and multi-company syndication is not popular in China, meaning that the relationships among venture capital companies are weak. The network is robust under either random or intentional attack, and possesses small world property. We also find from its community structure that, venture capital companies are more concentrated in developed districts but the links within the same district are scarce as compared to the links between different developed districts, indicating that venture capital companies are more willing to syndicate with companies in other developed districts. Furthermore, venture capital companies which invest in the same industry have closer relations within their communities than those which do not invest in the same industry. }}

In the \{QAP\} weighted network, a node depicts a relation and an undirect edge exists between any pair of nodes if there is significant correlation between relations. As an application of the \{QAP\} weighted network, we study international services trade by using the \{QAP\} weighted network, in which nodes depict 10 kinds of services trade relations. After the analysis of international services trade by \{QAP\} weighted network, and by using distance indicators, hierarchy tree and minimum spanning tree, the conclusion shows that: Firstly, significant correlation exists in all services trade, and the development of any one service trade will stimulate the other nine. Secondly, as the economic globalization goes deeper, correlations in all services trade have been strengthened continually, and clustering effects exist in those services trade. Thirdly, transportation services trade, computer and information services trade and communication services trade have the most influence and are at the core in all services trade. }}

Some of the topics of most concern in the field of weighted complex networks are finding how the synchronizability depends on various parameters of the network including the coupling strength, weight distribution and delay.

abstract = {Abstract Network science is a highly interdisciplinary field ranging from natural science to engineering technology and it has been applied to model complex systems and used to explain their behaviors. Most previous studies have been focus on isolated networks, but many real-world networks do in fact interact with and depend on other networks via dependency connectivities, forming “networks of networks” (NON). The interdependence between networks has been found to largely increase the vulnerability of interacting systems, when a node in one network fails, it usually causes dependent nodes in other networks to fail, which, in turn, may cause further damage on the first network and result in a cascade of failures with sometimes catastrophic consequences, e.g., electrical blackouts caused by the interdependence of power grids and communication networks. The vulnerability of a \{NON\} can be analyzed by percolation theory that can be used to predict the critical threshold where a \{NON\} collapses. We review here the analytic framework for analyzing the vulnerability of NON, which yields novel percolation laws for n-interdependent networks and also shows that percolation theory of a single network studied extensively in physics and mathematics in the last 50 years is a specific limited case of the more general case of n interacting networks. Understanding the mechanism behind the cascading failure in \{NON\} enables us finding methods to decrease the vulnerability of the natural systems and design of more robust infrastructure systems. By examining the vulnerability of \{NON\} under targeted attack and studying the real interdependent systems, we find two methods to decrease the systems vulnerability: (1) protect the high-degree nodes, and (2) increase the degree correlation between networks. Furthermore, the ultimate proof of our understanding of natural and technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. We also review the recent studies and challenges on the controllability of networks and temporal networks. }}

Although previous work studied function projective synchronization on complex dynamical networks, the dynamics of the nodes are coupled partially linear chaotic systems. In our work, the dynamics of the nodes of the complex networks are any chaotic systems without the limitation of the partial linearity. In addition, each network can be undirected or directed, connected or disconnected, and nodes in either network may have identical or different dynamics. The proposed strategy is applicable to almost all kinds of complex networks. Numerical simulations further verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed synchronization method. Numeric evidence shows that the synchronization rate is sensitively influenced by the feedback strength, the time delay, the network size and the network topological structure. }}

The topological characteristics of \{NFNs\} were analyzed by using the two most important characteristics of complex networks, namely, small-world structure and community structure. We found that the small-world properties exist in different \{NFNs\} constructed in this study. Modular function Q was used to determine the existence of community structure in NFNs, through which we found that community-structure characteristics, which are related to recorded spike train data sets, are more evident in the Y-maze task than in the DM-GM task. Our results can also be used to analyze further the relationship between small-world characteristics and the cognitive behavioral responses of rats. }}

In this paper, we investigate the structural properties of the Chinese air transportation multilayer network (ATMN) by progressively merging layers together, where each commercial airline (company) defines a layer. The results show that the high clustering coefficient, short characteristic path length and large collection of reachable destinations of the Chinese \{ATMN\} can only emerge when several layers are merged together. Moreover, we compare two main types of layers corresponding to major and low-cost airlines. It is found that the small-world property and the rich-club effect of the Chinese \{ATMN\} are mainly caused by those layers corresponding to major airlines. Our work will highlight a better understanding of the Chinese air transportation network. }}

Based on these principles and existing researches, a fast and efficient algorithm for detecting community structures in complex networks is proposed in this paper. The key strategy of the algorithm is to mine a node with the closest relations with the community and assign it to this community. Four real-world networks are used to test the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed is rather efficient for detecting community structures in complex networks. }}

Recent studies have proved that the whole network can be sufficiently steered by injecting control signals into a minimum set of driver nodes, and the minimum numbers of driver nodes for many real networks are high, indicating that it is difficult to control them. For some large natural and technological networks, it is impossible and not feasible to control the full network. For example, in biological networks like large-scale gene regulatory networks it is impossible to control all the genes. This prompts us to explore the question how to choose partial networks that are easy for controlling and important in networked systems. In this work, we propose a method to achieve this goal. By computing the minimum driver nodes densities of the partial networks of Erdös–Rényi (ER) networks, scale-free (SF) networks and 23 real networks, we find that our method performs better than random method that chooses nodes randomly. Moreover, we find that the nodes chosen by our method tend to be the essential elements of the whole systems, via studying the nodes chosen by our method of a real human signaling network and a human protein interaction network and discovering that the chosen nodes from these networks tend to be cancer-associated genes. The implementation of our method shows some interesting connections between the structure and the controllability of networks, improving our understanding of the control principles of complex systems. }}

However, it is insufficient to explain assortative or disassortative tendencies of individual nodes or links, which may be contrary to the overall tendency of the network. A number of ‘local’ assortativity measures have been proposed to address this. In this paper we define and analyse an alternative formulation for node assortativity, primarily for undirected networks. The alternative approach is justified by some inherent shortcomings of existing local measures of assortativity. Using this approach, we show that most real world scale-free networks have disassortative hubs, though we can synthesise model networks which have assortative hubs. Highlighting the relationship between assortativity of the hubs and network robustness, we show that real world networks do display assortative hubs in some instances, particularly when high robustness to targeted attacks is a necessity. }}

We contribute a detailed mathematical analysis of one of the heuristics and provide extensive simulation results on random graphs for both of them. These results indicate that, within certain limits, spanning subgraphs are indeed expected to emerge that perform well in respect to all requirements. We also discuss the spanning subgraphs’ inherent resilience to failures and adaptability to topological changes. }}

We adopt class dependency networks, where nodes represent software classes and edges represent dependencies among them, and show that these networks reveal a significant community structure, characterized by similar properties as observed in other complex networks. However, although intuitive and anticipated by different phenomena, identified communities do not exactly correspond to software packages. We empirically confirm our observations on several networks constructed from Java and various third party libraries, and propose different applications of community detection to software engineering. }}

Our results show that by constraining the admissible patterns of connection, and using an adaptive law based on the difference between the nodes, we can guarantee the stability of the synchronized solution of the network despite structural changes. Additionally, we extend our results by considering alternative structural evolution processes, namely, a node-based adaptive strategy and a resetting switching law.

The aim of the present study is to shed more light on the role of syntax in the syntactic network structure. In particular, we concentrate on the impact of the syntactic function of a verb in the sentence on the complex network structure. Verbs play the decisive role in the sentence structure (“local” importance). From this fact we hypothesize the importance of verbs in the complex network (“global” importance). The importance of verb in the complex network is assessed by the number of links which are directed from the node representing verb to other nodes in the network.

In this paper, we take this phenomenon into consideration and discuss its influence on rumor diffusion in complex networks by introducing independent spreaders. Independent spreaders are nodes that know the rumor from other channels rather than their neighbors. A new stochastic technique is used to obtain the dynamics of rumor diffusion. Results reveal that independent spreaders boost the process by bringing the rumor to regions remote from current spreaders. In order to accelerate diffusion, we find that improving the network connectivity is more efficient than adding more independent spreaders. }}

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the first topological analysis of the economic structure of an entire country based on payments data obtained from Swedbank. This data set is exclusive in its kind because around 80% of Estonia's bank transactions are done through Swedbank; hence, the economic structure of the country can be reconstructed. Scale-free networks are commonly observed in a wide array of different contexts such as nature and society. In this paper, the nodes are comprised by customers of the bank (legal entities) and the links are established by payments between these nodes. We study the scaling-free and structural properties of this network. We also describe its topology, components and behaviors. We show that this network shares typical structural characteristics known in other complex networks: degree distributions follow a power law, low clustering coefficient and low average shortest path length. We identify the key nodes of the network and perform simulations of resiliency against random and targeted attacks of the nodes with two different approaches. With this, we find that by identifying and studying the links between the nodes is possible to perform vulnerability analysis of the Estonian economy with respect to economic shocks. }}

abstract = {Abstract Master equations for the evolution of complex networks with positive (birth) and negative (death) transition probabilities per unit time are analyzed. Explicit equations for the time evolution of the total number of nodes and for the relative node frequencies are given. It is shown that, in the continuous limit, the master equation reduces to a Fokker–Planck equation (FPE). The basic dynamical function for its stationary solution is the ratio between its drift and diffusion coefficients. When this ratio is approximated by partial fractions (Padé’s approximants), a hierarchy of stationary solutions of the \{FPE\} is obtained analytically, which are expressed as an exponential times the product of powers of monomials and binomials. It is also shown that if the difference between birth and death transition probabilities goes asymptotically to zero, the exponential factor in the solution is absent. Fits to real complex network probability distribution functions are shown. Comparison with rank-ordered data shows that, in general, the value of this exponential factor is close to unity, evidencing crossovers among power-law scale invariant regimes which might be associated to an underlying criticality and are related to a generalization of the beta distribution. The time dependent solution is also obtained analytically in terms of hyper-geometric functions. It is also shown that the \{FPE\} has similarity solutions. The limitations of the approach here presented are also discussed. }}

However, we show here that all complex networks can be viewed as bipartite structures sharing some important statistics, like degree distributions. The basic properties of complex networks can be viewed as consequences of this underlying bipartite structure. This leads us to propose the first simple and intuitive model for complex networks which captures the main properties met in practice. }}

Different local modularity functions have been proposed in the scientific literature. In this work, we explore applying different ensemble approaches in order to combine different local modularity functions. Explored approaches include naive combine-and-rank approach, ensemble ranking approaches, and ensemble clustering. Experiments are conducted on different real and artificial benchmark networks for which ground truth community partitions are known. Results show that ensemble-ranking approaches provide better results than both state-of-the art approaches and other ensemble approaches. }}

The communities with hierarchical and overlapping structures and the special nodes like hubs and outliers are all common structure features to the networks. Network structure investigation has attracted considerable research effort recently. However, existing studies have only partially explored the structure features. In this paper, a label propagation based integrated network structure investigation algorithm (LINSIA) is proposed. The main novelty here is that \{LINSIA\} can uncover hierarchical and overlapping communities, as well as hubs and outliers. Moreover, \{LINSIA\} can provide insight into the label propagation mechanism and propose a parameter-free solution that requires no prior knowledge. In addition, \{LINSIA\} can give out a soft-partitioning result and depict the degree of overlapping nodes belonging to each relevant community. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. }}

Minimization of (a) the associated systemic risk and (b) the propagation of contagion in the case of a banking crisis are necessary conditions to achieve this goal. Central Banks are in charge of this significant undertaking via a close and detailed monitoring of the banking network. In this paper, we propose the use of an auxiliary supervision/monitoring system that is both efficient with respect to the required resources and can promptly identify a set of banks that are in distress so that immediate and appropriate action can be taken by the supervising authority. We use the network defined by the interrelations between banking institutions employing tools from Complex Networks theory for an efficient management of the entire banking network. In doing so, we introduce the Threshold Minimum Dominating Set (T-MDS). The T-MDS is used to identify the smallest and most efficient subset of banks that can be used as (a) sensors of distress of a manifesting banking crisis and (b) provide a path of possible contagion. We propose the use of this method as a supplementary monitoring tool in the arsenal of a Central Bank. Our dataset includes the 122 largest American banks in terms of their interbank loans. The empirical results show that when the T-MDS methodology is applied, we can have an efficient supervision of the whole banking network, by monitoring just a subset of 47 banks. }}

Here, we present a deeper investigation of an agent based model considering different network morphologies (regular, random, small-world) for the investors’ trust network, in an attempt to answer the question raised in the title. We study the model by considering four scenarios for the investors and different initial conditions to analyze their influence in the stock market fluctuations. We have characterized the stationary limit for each scenario tested, focusing on the changes introduced when complex networks were used, and calculated the Hurst exponent in some cases. Simulations showed interesting results suggesting that the fluctuations of the stock market index are strongly affected by the network morphology, a remarkable result which we believe was never reported or predicted before. }}

When the system evolves the cells can assume three states: proliferative, non-proliferative, and necrotic. Our results were compared with experimental data obtained from three human lung carcinoma cell lines. The computational simulations show that the cancerous cells have a Gompertzian growth. Also, our model simulates the formation of necrosis, increase of density, and resources diffusion to regions of lower nutrient concentration. We obtain that the cancer growth is very similar in random and small-world networks. On the other hand, the topological structure of the small-world network is more affected. The scale-free network has the largest rates of cancer growth due to hub formation. Finally, our results indicate that for different average degrees the rate of cancer growth is related to the available space in the network. }}

By utilizing M-matrix properties, a novel Lyapunov function and the stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient criteria of mean square synchronization and global synchronization for the two classes of \{MSCNs\} under feedback control are derived. Three numerical examples and simulations are given to illustrate the following conclusions: (1) the two classes of \{MSCNs\} under the same linear negative feedback controller can achieve mean square exponential synchronization and global synchronization if they satisfy sufficient conditions of mean square exponential synchronization; (2) by computing synchronization control cost, we obtain that global synchronization controllability for the first class of \{MSCNs\} may perhaps stronger or poorer than that of the second class of \{MSCNs\} with time-varying delays. }}

Solutions of the generalized hyperbolic geometric flow are such geometries. Here we propose a scale-free network model, which is a random geometric graph on a two dimensional disc. The metric of the disc is a Ricci flat solution of the flow. The model is used to physically simulate the growth and aggregation of a type of cancer cell. }}

abstract = {Abstract Complex networks are often characterized by their statistical and topological network properties such as degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient. However, many more characteristics can also be considered such as graph similarity, centrality, or flow properties. These properties have been utilized as feedback for algorithms whose goal is to ascertain plausible network models (also called generators) for a given network. However, a good set of network measures to employ that can be said to sufficiently capture network structure is not yet known. In this paper we provide an investigation into this question through a meta-analysis that quantifies the ability of a subset of measures to appropriately compare model (dis)similarity. The results are utilized as fitness measures for improving a recently proposed genetic programming (GP) framework that is capable of ascertaining a plausible network model from a single network observation. It is shown that the candidate model evaluation criteria of the \{GP\} system to automatically infer existing (man-made) network models, in addition to real-world networks, is improved. }}

That is, for arbitrary complex networks, the degree–rank distribution can be derived from the degree distribution, and the reverse is true. Using the mathematical relationship, we study the degree–rank distributions of scale-free networks and exponential networks. We demonstrate that the degree–rank distributions of scale-free networks follow a power law only if scaling exponent λ&gt;2.

Through topological principles, this paper investigates the controllability features of an ensemble of 58 U.S. city-level power transmission networks in seven U.S. states. To perform structural controllability analyses, the topological characteristics of the ensemble of networks are first quantified, including degree, shortest path length, clustering coefficient, meshedness and betweenness centrality, as well as the uncertainty associated with these and related properties. Then, the paper focuses on the controllability features of complex networks so as to detect the minimal sets of driver nodes to possibly control the networks given system linearity assumptions. Accordingly, a node is critical, intermittent or redundant if it acts as a driver node in all, some, or none of the potentially controllable system configurations. Moreover, this paper constructs a new methodology to quantify the probability of being a driver node among the intermittent nodes, and reveals the controllability importance of system components. Results show that a small proportion of driver nodes can provide the conditions for controlling the slow dynamics of entire power transmission networks from a topological perspective, despite variations in network sizes and configurations. This paper also reveals that the driver nodes tend to avoid high degree nodes and high triangulation sub-graph nodes as well as high betweenness centrality nodes. The identification of topological differences for different categories of nodes (critical, intermittent or redundant) could help researchers and utilities understand the conditions for future functional controllability of power networks while improving their reliability and resilience as well as facilitating their transition into smart grid systems. }}

The topology of this system is described by task-resource network and modeled as directed and weighted graph, in which nodes represent various tasks and edges denote the resources exchanged among tasks. Using the properties of node degree distribution, strength distribution and other weighted quantities, we demonstrate the heterogeneity of the network and point out the relation between structural characters of vertices and the functionality of corresponding tasks. The above phenomena indicate that the design requirements and principles of production process contribute to the heterogeneous features of the network. Besides, betweenness centrality of nodes can be used as an importance indicator to provide additional information for decision making. The correlations between structure and weighted properties are investigated to further address the influence brought by production schemes in system connectivity patterns. Cascading failures model is employed to analyze the robustness of the network when targeted attack happens. Two capacity assignment strategies are compared in order to improve the robustness of the network at certain cost. The refinery system displays more reliable behavior when the protecting strategy considers heterogeneous properties. This phenomenon further implies the structure-activity relationship of the refinery system and provides insightful suggestions for process system design. The results also indicate that robustness analysis is a promising application of methodologies from complex networks to process system engineering. }}

Conversely whether a homogeneous network has a rich-club or not generally has no significant effect on its structure. These findings open the possibility to optimize and control the structure of complex networks by manipulating rich-club connections. Furthermore, based on the subgraph ratio profile, we develop a more rigorous approach to judge whether a network has a rich-club or not. The new method does not calculate how many links there are among rich nodes but depends on how the links among rich nodes can affect the overall structure as well as the function of a given network. }}

By mapping daily time series from 141 different stations of 53 Brazilian rivers into complex networks, we present a useful approach for investigating the dynamics of river flows. We verified that the degree distributions of these networks were well described by exponential functions, where the characteristic exponents are almost always larger than the value obtained for random time series. The faster-than-random decay of the degree distributions is an another evidence that the fluctuation dynamics underlying the river discharges has a long-range correlated nature. We further investigated the evolution of the river discharges by tracking the values of the characteristic exponents (of the degree distribution) and the global clustering coefficients of the networks over the years. We show that the river discharges in several stations have evolved to become more or less correlated (and displaying more or less complex internal network structures) over the years, a behavior that could be related to changes in the climate system and other man-made phenomena. }}

Based on the tumor clinical data (718 cases) collected, data mining was performed with the help of the statistical information of the complex network. The results showed that interaction effects among multi-variables were discovered by a complex systems entropy network. A total of 116 pairs of synergy variables and 14 core synergy cliques, 82 pairs of antagonistic variables and 7 core antagonistic cliques were found after 718 cases of data mining.

We focus on network motifs, the local pattern which appears more often in a statistically signiﬁcant sense. Network motifs describe the most signiﬁcant connection pattern between these nodes. We investigated their functions and semantical relationship. We also investigated different generalizations of network motifs and analyzed the larger pattern in the complex networks. As the word network is quite huge and the motif detection is very slow when motifs are much larger, for larger pattern in the network we used topology generalization of simple motifs rather than carry out a thorough motif detection task.

However, the acquaintance immunization strategy fails to take the time-varying factor and local information of nodes into consideration, which limits its effectiveness in some specific network topology. Our improved immunization strategy is based on a new mathematical model Network Structure Index (NSI), which digs deep to measure the connection property and surrounding influence of a node׳s neighbor nodes to better determine the importance of nodes during immunization. Both mathematical derivation and the simulation program tested on various network topology support our idea that this improved acquaintance immunization strategy protects more nodes from infection and immunizes important nodes more efficiently than the original strategies. As to say, our strategy has more adaptability and achieves a more reasonable balanced point between cost and effectiveness. }}

The approach allows to visualize/identify the critical elements of a complex network. This is an important first step for many recent problems arising in social networks, critical infrastructures and homeland security. By identifying these elements one can prioritize resource allocation to protect, interdict or improve performance in these types of systems.

Social power is given to a proportion of agents selected either randomly or based on their degrees. As artificial network structures, we consider scale-free networks constructed through preferential attachment and Watts–Strogatz networks. Numerical simulations show that scale-free networks with degree-based social power on the hub nodes have an optimal case where the largest number of the nodes reaches a consensus. However, given power to a random selection of nodes could not improve consensus properties. Introducing social power in Watts–Strogatz networks could not significantly change the consensus profile. }}

In this framework, a pseudo-dual graph transformation of the grain contact network produces a graph of pores which can be readily interpreted as a pore space network. Survivability, a new metric succinctly summarizing the connectivity of the solid grain and pore space networks, measures material robustness. The size distribution and the connectivity of pores can be characterized quantitatively through various network properties. Assortativity characterizes the pore space with respect to the parity of the number of particles enclosing the pore. Multiscale clusters of odd parity versus even parity contact cycles alternate spatially along the shear band: these represent, respectively, local jamming and unjamming regions that continually switch positions in time throughout the failure regime. Optimal paths, established using network shortest paths in favor of large pores, provide clues on preferential paths for interstitial matter transport. In systems with higher rolling resistance at contacts, less tortuous shortest paths thread through larger pores in shear bands. Notably the structural patterns uncovered in the pore space suggest that more robust models of interstitial pore flow through deforming granular systems require a proper consideration of the evolution of in situ shear band and fracture patterns – not just globally, but also inside these localized failure zones. }}

Centrality measures are used to rank node influence in a spreading dynamics. Here we propose a node influence measure based on the centrality of a node and its neighbors’ centrality, which we call the neighborhood centrality. By simulating the spreading processes in six real-world networks, we find that the neighborhood centrality greatly outperforms the basic centrality of a node such as the degree and coreness in ranking node influence and identifying the most influential spreaders. Interestingly, we discover a saturation effect in considering the neighborhood of a node, which is not the case of the larger the better. Specifically speaking, considering the 2-step neighborhood of nodes is a good choice that balances the cost and performance. If further step of neighborhood is taken into consideration, there is no obvious improvement and even decrease in the ranking performance. The saturation effect may be informative for studies that make use of the local structure of a node to determine its importance in the network. }}

However, this identification of key work stations is particularly important during the design and operation phase of a manufacturing system, as they allow a cost-optimal system improvement with limited inference on the operation. Our approach discusses the “bottleneck” oriented approach commonly applied today in the context of network effects in manufacturing systems and compares its performance to centrality measures from complex network theory. }}

Matrix factorization is then utilized to assign nodes into their corresponding community structures.

Experimental results in real and artificial networks show, with great accuracy, that the proposed method succeeds to recover most of the overlapping communities existing in the network. }}

We consider an extended version of the bounded confidence model in which the uncertainty of each agent is adaptively controlled by the network. A number of informed agents with the desired opinion value is added to the network and create links with other agents such that large portion of the network follows their opinions. We propose to connect the informed agents to nodes with small in-degrees and high out-degree that are connected to high in-degree nodes. Our experimental results on both model and real social networks show superior performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art heuristic methods in the facet of opinion formation models. }}

Firstly, an index called Community Intimacy (CI) is presented to measure the adjacency relationship between the communities, based on which a community ordering algorithm is introduced. According to the proposed Community-Sector hypothesis, which supposes that most nodes of one community gather in a same sector in hyperbolic space, \{CHM\} maps the ordered communities into hyperbolic space, and then the angular coordinates of nodes are randomly initialized within the sector that they belong to. Therefore, all the network nodes are so far mapped to hyperbolic space, and then the initialized angular coordinates can be optimized by employing the information of all nodes, which can greatly improve the algorithm precision. By applying the proposed dual-layer angle sampling method in the optimization procedure, \{CHM\} reduces the time complexity to O ( n 2 ) . The experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. }}

In this paper, we study community structures of more than twenty existing networks using ten commonly used community-detecting methods, and discovery that most communities have several leaders whose degrees are particularly large. We use statistical parameter, variance, to classify the communities as leader communities and self-organized communities. In a leader community, we defined the nodes with largest 10 % degree as its leaders. In our experiences, when removing the leaders, on average community’s internal edges are reduced by more than 40 % and inter-communities edges are reduced by more than 20 % . In addition, community’s average clustering coefficient decreases. These facts suggest that the leaders play an important role in keeping communities denser and more clustered, and it is the leaders that are more likely to link to other communities. Moreover, similar results for several random networks are obtained, and a theoretical lower bound of the lost internal edges is given. Our study shed the light on the further understanding and application of the internal community structure in complex networks. }}

The main idea consists in embedding the characteristics of climate variables, e.g., temperature, pressure or rainfall, into the topology of complex networks by appropriate linear and nonlinear measures. Applying such measures on climate time series leads to defining links between their corresponding locations on the studied region, whereas the locations are the network's nodes. The resulted networks, consequently, are analysed using the various network analysis tools present in literature in order to get a better insight on the processes, patterns and interactions occurring in climate system. In this regard we present ClimNet; a complete set of software tools to construct climate networks based on a wide range of linear (cross correlation) and nonlinear (Information theoretic) measures. The presented software will allow the construction of large networks’ adjacency matrices from climate time series while supporting functions to tune relationships to different time-scales by means of symbolic ordinal analysis. The provided tools have been used in the production of various original contributions in climate research. This work presents an in-depth description of the implemented statistical functions widely used to construct climate networks. Additionally, a general overview of the architecture of the developed software is provided as well as a brief analysis of application examples. }}

Various sampling techniques like a Page Rank random walk, a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain and others serve to collect information about the nodes. The paper contributes to the comparison of sampling techniques in complex networks by means of the first hitting time, that is the minimal time required to reach a large node. Both the mean and the distribution of the first hitting time is shown to be determined by the so called extremal index. The latter indicates a dependence measure of extremes and also rejects the cluster structure of the network. The clustering is caused by dependence between nodes and heavy-tailed distributions of their degrees. Based on extreme value theory we estimate the mean and the distribution of the first hitting time and the distribution of node degrees by real data from social networks. We demonstrate the heaviness of the tails of these data using appropriate tools. The same methodology can be applied to other complex networks like peer- to-peer telecommunication systems. }}

Using the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) technique, a particularly useful canonical tool of the graph theory, two transitions of the topology of a complex network representing the \{FSE\} were found. The first transition is from a hierarchical scale-free \{MST\} representing the stock market before the recent worldwide financial crash, to a superstar-like \{MST\} decorated by a scale-free hierarchy of trees representing the market’s state for the period containing the crash. Subsequently, a transition is observed from this transient, (meta)stable state of the crash to a hierarchical scale-free \{MST\} decorated by several star-like trees after the worldwide financial crash. The phase transitions observed are analogous to the ones we obtained earlier for the Warsaw Stock Exchange and more pronounced than those found by Onnela–Chakraborti–Kaski–Kertész for the S&amp;P 500 index in the vicinity of Black Monday (October 19, 1987) and also in the vicinity of January 1, 1998.

The correlation between topology and functions is also explored, by which we find that \{LKN\} is a highly modularized network with 12 key communities. Moreover, we investigate the robustness of \{LKN\} under random failures and intentional attacks. The result shows that the failure of the large in-degree nodes providing basic services will do more damage on the whole system. Our work may shed some light on the design of complex software systems. }}

We investigate synchronization dynamics on the corticocortical network of the cat by modeling each node (cortical area) of the network with a sub-network of interacting excitable neurons. We find that the network displays clustered synchronization behavior, and the dynamical clusters coincide with the topological community structures observed in the anatomical network. Our results provide insights into the relationship between the global organization and the functional specialization of the brain cortex. }}

In order to avoid nodes overloading, the new algorithm is derived on the basis of generalized betweenness centrality which gives an estimate of traffic handled by the node for a route set. Since the nodes with large betweenness centrality are more susceptible to traffic congestion, the traffic can be improved, as our strategy, by redistributing traffic load from nodes with large betweenness centrality to nodes with small betweenness centrality in the proceeding of computing collective routing table. Particularly, depending on a parameter that controls the optimization scale, the new routing can not only enlarge traffic capacity of networks more, but also enhance traffic efficiency with smaller average path length. Comparing results of previous routing strategies, it is shown that the present improved routing performs more effectively. }}

Numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical results. }}

In this paper, we propose a technique for time series clustering via community detection in complex networks. First, we construct a network where every vertex represents a time series connected its most similar ones,. Similarity was calculated using different time series distance functions. Then, we applied a community detection algorithm to identify groups of strongly connected vertices in order to produce time series clusters. We verified which distance function works better with every clustering algorithm and compared them to our approach. The experimental results show that our approach statistically outperformed many traditional clustering algorithms. We find that the community detection approach can detect groups that other techniques fail to identify. }}

Co-expression networks were constructed by differentially co-expressed genes and links. Regulatory impact factors (RIF) metric was used to identify critical transcription factors (TFs). The protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and clusters were obtained through molecular complex detection (MCODE) algorithm. Centralities analyses for complex networks were performed based on degree, stress and betweenness. Enrichment analyses were performed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Results Co-expression networks and \{TFs\} (based on expression data of global \{DEGs\} and \{DEGs\} in different stages and grades) were identified. Hub genes of complex networks, such as UBE2C, ACTA2, FABP4, CKS2, \{FN1\} and TOP2A, were also obtained according to analysis of degree. In gene enrichment analyses of global DEGs, cell adhesion, proteinaceous extracellular matrix and extracellular matrix structural constituent were top three \{GO\} terms.

The study shows that the present Chinese domestic airline network is a small-world network with degree distribution obeying a double power law. Compared with the network structure in 2005, its average mimimum path length and clustering coefficient decrease with the increases of node and average degree. The node throughput, distance strengths and degree correspond to the positive power law. The effect of degree on throughput is more significant than that on distance. The betweenness centrality and degree positively correlated with fluctuations. The degree-degree correlation of the present network is negative, which shows the nodes with large degree prefer to be connected to other nodes with small degree and the effect of throughput on connection between nodes is greater than the effect of distance. When the degree value is high, the clustering coefficient distribution on degree obviously follows power-law. It indicates that the group structure centering around airports with large degree has appeared in Chinese airline network. }}

Pairs of source and target are selected from the nodes in the networks, and the messages are passed along from source to target in this space based on the greedy routing strategy. The extensive experiments we carried out suggest that, the higher navigability, defined by proportion of messages successfully delivered, is related to stronger modularity of the complex networks. In addition, the optimal dimension K of the embedding Euclidean space is found to be approximately identical to half of the landmark number. }}

The model is relaxed by a simple convex positive semi-definite program, which can be optimized efficiently.

Thereby, it provides a useful tool in the family of community detection algorithms and in the family of graph layout methods. }}

Identifying the most influential nodes in a network can be useful in many applications like immunization of nodes in case of epidemic spreading, during intentional attacks on complex networks. A lot of research is being done to devise centrality measures which could efficiently identify the most influential nodes in a network. There are two major approaches to this problem: On one hand, deterministic strategies that exploit knowledge about the overall network topology, while on the other end, random strategies are completely agnostic about the network structure. Centrality measures that can deal with a limited knowledge of the network structure are of prime importance. Indeed, in practice, information about the global structure of the overall network is rarely available or hard to acquire. Even if available, the structure of the network might be too large that it is too much computationally expensive to calculate global centrality measures. To that end, a centrality measure is proposed here that requires information only at the community level. Indeed, most of the real-world networks exhibit a community structure that can be exploited efficiently to discover the influential nodes. We performed a comparative evaluation of prominent global deterministic strategies together with stochastic strategies, an available and the proposed deterministic community-based strategy. Effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by performing experiments on synthetic and real-world networks with community structure in the case of immunization of nodes for epidemic control. }}

However, the intrinsic relations between a network topology and its functionalities are still unclear. A question arises naturally: For a network model which can reproduce some topological characteristics of the underlying network, is it reasonable and valid to use this model to be a test-bed for evaluating the network’s performances? To answer this question, we take a close look at several typical complex network models of the AS-level Internet as examples of study. We find that although a model can represent the Internet in terms of topological metrics, it cannot be used to evaluate the Internet performances. Our findings reveal that the approaches using topological metrics to discriminate network models, which have been widely used in the engineering community, may lead to confusing or even incorrect conclusions. }}

The fractal dimension of the acupoints and meridians complex network is determined by means of two independent methods: the first estimates the fractal dimension by means of the box counting and radius mass algorithms, the second performs a straightforward calculation of the dimension from applying the volume definition of fractal dimension to the graph. The estimated fractal dimension varied between 1.28 and 1.91, with correlation ratios of 0.999 in all cases. It was not possible to calculate the fractal dimension by the volume method since the graph volume did not vary in a power law relation to the distance. Therefore it is established that the acupoints and meridians network is not a fractal one. In comparison to other complex systems, the acupoints complex network has a complexity that is similar to the Caenorhabditis elegans metabolic one and to the embryonic cell lineage network, although lower than other biological networks. }}

In this paper, with finite total bandwidth resource of the network, we propose to dynamically allocate the total bandwidth resource in which each link’s bandwidth is proportional to the queue length of the output buffer of the link per time step. With plenty of data packets in the network, the traffic handling ability of all links of the network achieves full utilization.

For instance, let G(p, q) be a graph obtained from two cliques, Kp and Kq(p ⩾ q ⩾ 3), joined by a single edge. It is apparent that this graph contains two communities, namely the two cliques. However, Estrada and Hatano’s algorithm detects only Kq as a community when p is sufficiently larger than q. Our algorithm correctly detects both communities. Also, our method also finds the correct community structure in one of the classic benchmark networks, the Zachary karate club. }}

Many algorithms have been proposed in the last decade, and most of them focus on the non-overlapping community structures in the early days. Overlapping and hierarchical structures are another two important properties in complex networks, which have attracted researchers’ extensive concern in recent years. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage method which can detect the hierarchical, non-overlapping and overlapping community structures in complex networks. In this method, the \{CNM\} algorithm, a fast hierarchical agglomerative algorithm proposed by Clauset, Newman and Moore, is used in the first stage. In the second stage, a new evaluation function named as influence coefficient based on the local community structure is proposed, which can get the overlapping community structures at different overlapping levels by adjusting a tunable parameter. Besides, the proposed evaluation function can detect the wrongly classified nodes in the partition of the first stage and correct them. Finally, the computational complexity of the algorithm is low. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world network datasets show the efficiency of our method. }}

Exploring the fluctuating rules of autocorrelation can aid in understanding the fluctuating mechanism of crude oil prices. To study the role of fluctuating modes of autocorrelation in crude oil prices, which have time series characteristics, this study selected international crude oil spot prices as sample data to employ the methods of statistical physics. The fluctuating modes of autocorrelation were defined by the autocorrelation coefficient, symbolization, and a coarse-graining process. We set the modes as nodes and the transformation between modes as edges; the fluctuating mode weight network of autocorrelation was then built. Thus, the study of autocorrelation fluctuation was transformed to a network study. Then, certain aspects, such as the statistical properties, the “small-world” behavior, and the transmission medium in the network, could be analyzed using complex network theory and analytical methods. The periodicity of the fluctuation was calculated using a spectral analysis method. This study not only describes the fluctuation of the time series more precisely than other methods but also provides ideas for methods of studying the fluctuation of univariate autocorrelations. }}

It is argued that the diffusive evolution of the network on the Cayley tree shapes its fractality, self-similarity and the branching number criticality without any control parameter. The last attribute of the scale-free network is an intrinsic property of the skeleton, a special type of spanning tree which determines its fractality. }}

Some features could be extracted from node labels and other kinds of priori knowledge. But how to perform the feature classification without priori knowledge is a challenge. This paper addresses the key problem: how do we conduct role extraction in networks with only edge connections known? On the basis of behavior differences in dynamics, nodes are classified into three role groups: Leaders(L), Communicators(C) and Members(M). Unlike traditional community detections, we detect overlapping communities by link clustering first and then classify nodes according to the community entropy, which describes the disorder of how many different communities a node connects to. We propose a time saving and unsupervised learning approach for automatically discovering nodes’ roles based solely on network topology. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on six real-world networks through pinning control. By controlling communicator nodes, the controllability is enhanced and the cost for control is reduced obviously in networks with strong community structure. }}

Due to the large scale and complex structure of these networks, analysis and studies on a complete network require a lot of computational resources and storage space, which will also consume a large amount of energy. Sampling algorithms provide a new green approach for this problem. Especially some researches related to network communities with high energy consumption can be directly conducted on the sampled networks, which maintain the community structure of original networks. In this paper, we propose a sampling algorithm named Improved Forest Fire Sampling algorithm based on PageRank (IFFST-PR) based on the idea of Forest Fire Sampling and PageRank algorithm. IFFST-PR can maintain the community structure of original networks. We select a set of key nodes called community cluster center, according to a coefficient named community coefficient. Besides, we adopt PageRank to decide the order of initiative sampling nodes. To make a comprehensive comparison of IFFST-PR with other 6 algorithms, we use network community profile and Kolmogorov–Smirno D statistics to prove the consistency between sampled networks and original networks. Experiments applied on 3 different data sets show that IFFST-PR has better performance in terms of most parameters defined in network community profile than those of the other 6 algorithms. }}

In this paper, we study the impact of maximal vertex coverage (MVC) attack in large complex networks, where the attacker aims at deleting as many edges of the network as possible by attacking a small fraction of nodes. First, we present two metrics to measure the impact of \{MVC\} attack. To compute these metrics, we propose an efficient randomized greedy algorithm with near-optimal performance guarantee. Second, we generalize the \{MVC\} attack into an uncertain setting, in which a node is deleted by the attacker with a prior probability. We refer to the \{MVC\} attack under such uncertain environment as the probabilistic \{MVC\} attack. Based on the probabilistic \{MVC\} attack, we propose two adaptive metrics, and then present an adaptive greedy algorithm for calculating such metrics accurately and efficiently. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 real datasets. The results show that \{P2P\} and co-authorship networks are extremely robust under the \{MVC\} attack while both the online social networks and the Email communication networks exhibit vulnerability under the \{MVC\} attack. In addition, the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for computing the proposed metrics. }}

The strength of these methods is not only apparent in their systemic coherence but also in their capacity to consider a variety of components as a whole system. Given this background, the aim of this paper is to apply a methodology, tested for the Italian insular region of Sardinia, to an analysis of commuter accessibility in the United States through an indicator-based strategy. Spatial measures are applied to study the level of accessibility for commuters at the county level. The analysis provides us with an assessment of the accessibility for U.S. commuters and allows for the consideration of spatial planning objectives for U.S. counties. }}

This paper presents a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Affinity Propagation (APMOEA) which improves the accuracy of community detection. Firstly, \{APMOEA\} takes the method of affinity propagation (AP) to initially divide the network. To accelerate its convergence, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm selects nondominated solutions from the preliminary partitioning results as its initial population. Secondly, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm finds solutions approximating the true Pareto optimal front through constantly selecting nondominated solutions from the population after crossover and mutation in iterations, which overcomes the tendency of data clustering methods to fall into local optima. Finally, \{APMOEA\} uses an elitist strategy, called “external archive”, to prevent degeneration during the process of searching using the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. According to this strategy, the preliminary partitioning results obtained by \{AP\} will be archived and participate in the final selection of Pareto-optimal solutions. Experiments on benchmark test data, including both computer-generated networks and eight real-world networks, show that the proposed algorithm achieves more accurate results and has faster convergence speed compared with seven other state-of-art algorithms. }}

This paper proposes a study framework that combines grey relation analysis (GRA) and complex network theory to reveal the interdependence among oil price fluctuations from the one-to-one to many-to-many perspective. We used 26 groups of weekly oil price time series involving \{OPEC\} and non-OPEC oil spot prices and global representative oil future prices as empirical data. We attempted to characterize the oil price fluctuations’ spread and interdependence before and after the global ﬁnancial crisis and analyze possible leading roles. Our main findings focused on the changes before and after the global ﬁnancial crisis. First, the \{GRA\} results showed the interdependence among oil price fluctuations is strengthened, which indicated the globalization characteristic of oil price fluctuations. Second, the general characteristic of oil price fluctuations’ interdependent network showed the global oil prices tend to be more obvious regional collectivization, and the average spreading path length of global oil price fluctuations becomes shorter. Third, the nodes’ characteristic of network showed the number of the leading and intermediary oil prices are reduced, particularly, the role of the \{WTI\} and Brent oil future prices is relatively weakened. Fourth, the division of network community showed the more remarkable double characteristics both of the globalization and regionalization of global oil price fluctuations. These findings provide a novel perspective to understand the oil market before and after the global ﬁnancial crisis. }}

This method results in confusion over the invulnerability of various types of complex networks. By normalizing network performance and defining a baseline, this paper defines the invulnerability index as the integral of the normalized network performance curve minus the baseline. This quantitative method seeks to measure network invulnerability under both edge and node attacks and provides a definition on the distinguishment of the robustness and fragility of networks. To demonstrate the proposed method, three small-world networks were selected as test beds. The simulation results indicate that the proposed invulnerability index can effectively and accurately quantify network resilience and can deal with both the node and edge attacks. The index can provide a valuable reference for determining network invulnerability in future research. }}

The results indicate that some indicators of plan network such as average degree, clustering coefficient and average shortest distance has increased. However, due to expansion of service radius, the network efficiency decreased slightly. Then, aiming at important nodes failure and line failure, the paper compares the network flexibility after node failure and line failure, and calibrates the key nodes in the network. The results show that the node and line failure have smaller impacts on the planning network. The fundamentality of some nodes changes with the network improvement.

The proposed randomly occurring phenomena include both probabilistic missing measurements and randomly occurring coupling delays which are described by two random variable sequences satisfying individual probability distributions, respectively. Rather than the common Lipschitz-type function, a more general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to characterize the nonlinearities in the networks. The purpose of the addressed H ∞ state estimation problem is to design a state estimator such that, for all admissible nonlinear disturbances, missing measurements as well as coupling delays, the dynamics of the augmented systems is guaranteed to be exponentially mean-square stable and attenuated to a given H ∞ performance level. By constructing a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and utilizing convex optimization method as well as Kronecker product, we derive the sufficient conditions under which the desired state estimator exists. An illustrative example is exploited to show the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation scheme. }}

They are conventionally classified according to the country they were built, to the style (Roman, classic and contemporary) or to the construction site. In this study, we show that labyrinths can be modeled as complex networks, whose metrics can be used to classify them in terms of their difficulty to find the way out. This is performed by calculating the absorption time, defined as the time it takes for a particle on an internal node to reach an output node through a random walk. The absorption time correlates well with the shortest paths and length of the networks, as expected, and has a very high correlation (Pearson coefficient of 0.97) with the betweenness, therefore allowing one to quantify the level of complexity of any labyrinth. It is shown that the conventional classification is inappropriate to distinguish between labyrinths, because some with very similar properties exist in different countries or were built in distinct time periods. A refined analysis in 77 famous labyrinths indicated that the majority were built for aesthetic purposes, with relatively small absorption times. Furthermore, with the expectation maximization algorithm, we could combine the complex network metrics to identify four clusters of labyrinths that differ in terms of density and shape. }}

The gap discovered between international crude oil prices and the crude oil price based on exchange rates may indicate the fluctuation of the forex burden. There exist different fluctuant patterns in the fluctuation process of the forex burden in different periods. Hence, we proposed an approach combining econometrics and complex network theory to explore the transmission mechanism of these fluctuant patterns. In this study, we defined the forex burden and the fluctuant patterns by normalization, sliding windows of data and econometric models. And then we set the fluctuant patterns as nodes and the transformation between patterns as edges; in this way, the transmission complex network is constructed. The results show that different major fluctuant patterns with different probabilities appear in different scales. The fluctuant patterns transferred into each other conveniently. And the transmission medium can help to identify the transitional periods in the process of the transmission. The contribution of this study to the energy policy decision-making is that the formulations of related policies under different period lengths require different reference standards. }}

Furthermore, we can also change the stability and direction of bifurcating periodic solutions by choosing appropriate control parameters. Numerical simulation results confirm that the new feedback controller using time delay is efficient in controlling Hopf bifurcation. }}

We also provide another example of network model using a combination of preferential and random attachment mechanisms (P-R model) and compare it with the distribution of the Tsallis entropy. In this case, we show that by adequately identifying the exponent factor q , the degree distribution can also be written in the q -exponential form.

The numerical results indicate that each driver’s three running costs and the corresponding total cost are relevant to the gap of the time the driver enters the network. The results can help us to further explore each driver’s trip cost in a more complex network under other route choice behavior. }}

And the researches on whether the common topologies of public transport network for cities in different scales do not rely on some extend factors such as population, society or economic, and the researches on the evolutionary mechanisms of public transport network are still limited. This paper studies the public transport networks of 330 cities in China based on the space P concept. Statistical results show that the degree distribution of all networks can be described by an exponential function. It reveals that the evolution mechanism of public transport network is randomly connected instead of preferential attached. All the networks show typical small-world behaviors which characterized by larger clustering coefficient and smaller average shortest path. A transition between the dissortative small networks N&lt;1,000 and assortative large networks N7gt;1,000 is observed. Average clustering coefficient of nodes with degree k decreases with k as a power law, shows that city bus transfer networks are well characterized by hierarchical modularity. The results of this study may provide guidance and reference for researches on evolution mechanism of urban public transport systems and transport network evolution modeling. }}

We further propose a stochastic optimization algorithm to rapidly detect a local community, which allows for uncovering the directional modular characteristics in directed networks. Numerical results show that the proposed method can resolve detailed local communities with directional information and provide more structural characteristics of directed networks than previous methods. }}

A new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed and by using quadratic convex approach, reciprocal convex technique and Jensen׳s inequality, sufficient conditions for the synchronization of complex networks are derived. Based on the average dwell-time method and delay-probability-distribution-dependent condition, the synchronization criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. }}

Unlike other proposed solutions, there is no need to assume that the network has multiple copies of contents; the protocol finds all contents reliably, even if every node in the network starts with a unique content. The scaling behavior of the size of the giant connected component of a random graph with heavy-tailed degree distributions under bond percolation is at the heart of our results. The percolation search algorithm can be directly applied to make unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, such as Gnutella, Limewire and other file-sharing systems (which naturally display heavy-tailed degree distributions and approximate scale-free network structures), scalable. For example, simulations of the protocol on the limewire crawl number 5 network [Ripeanu et al., Mapping the Gnutella network: properties of large-scale peer-to-peer systems and implications for system design, \{IEEE\} Internet Comput.

The effect of spatial domain on the mean square H∞ synchronization is also embodied in this criterion. When the coupled \{SPDSs\} cannot achieve the mean square H∞ synchronization, the adaptive controllers are adopted for the coupled SPDSs, and the effectiveness of the adaptive controllers is verified via a rigorous mathematical analysis. When the number of the nodes in the complex networks is large, pinning control is a natural choice. The adaptive pinning control strategy is also presented and a criterion is obtained which guarantees the mean square H∞ synchronization of coupled SPDSs. Numerical experiments are also given to illustrate the correctness of our results. }}

abstract = {A fundamental problem in the study of complex networks is to provide quantitative measures of correlation and information flow between different parts of a system. To this end, several notions of communicability have been introduced and applied to a wide variety of real-world networks in recent years. Several such communicability functions are reviewed in this paper. It is emphasized that communication and correlation in networks can take place through many more routes than the shortest paths, a fact that may not have been sufficiently appreciated in previously proposed correlation measures. In contrast to these, the communicability measures reviewed in this paper are defined by taking into account all possible routes between two nodes, assigning smaller weights to longer ones. This point of view naturally leads to the definition of communicability in terms of matrix functions, such as the exponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument is either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the network. Considerable insight on communicability can be gained by modeling a network as a system of oscillators and deriving physical interpretations, both classical and quantum-mechanical, of various communicability functions. Applications of communicability measures to the analysis of complex systems are illustrated on a variety of biological, physical and social networks. The last part of the paper is devoted to a review of the notion of locality in complex networks and to computational aspects that by exploiting sparsity can greatly reduce the computational efforts for the calculation of communicability functions for large networks. }}

As a special case, projective synchronization in a \{DRCN\} without time delay is analyzed by using a different method. The corresponding synchronization criterion is given, which can be realized by adopting single-node adaptive control. This paper extends previous work, where the nodes of the \{DRCN\} are partially linear, there is limitation of the coupling matrix or the scale factors of the nodes are all equal. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization criteria.

The foundation and importance of this quantity relating to some topological and dynamic properties prompt us to explore the role of determinant identities for Laplace matrices. We introduce the basic electrically equivalent technique to determine an exact analytical expression for the quantity on the contact graph of disk packings, which is proposed by Zhang et al. (2009). Our theoretical results shed light on the relationship between the microscopic change of the quantity and topological iteration of the network. In particular, we compare the entropy of spanning trees on the network with the other two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattices. We show that the new model is a small-world scale-free network with the maximum entropy so far found.

These time series can be investigated from a complex network perspective. Using two-state Markov chain and the binary visibility graph, we investigate these time series. Moreover, several topological aspects of the constructed graph, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and mean visibility length are studied. Our results show that the Markov-binary visibility algorithm stands as a simple method to discriminate statistically dependent and independent systems. Some remarkable examples confirm the reliability of Markov-binary visibility graph for time series analysis. }}

abstract = {Buzzword-based viral marketing, known also as digital word-of-mouth marketing, is a marketing mode attached to some carriers on the Internet, which can rapidly copy marketing information at a low cost. Viral marketing actually uses a pre-existing social network where, however, the scale of the pre-existing network is believed to be so large and so random, so that its theoretical analysis is intractable and unmanageable. There are very few reports in the literature on how to design a spreading scheme for viral marketing on real social networks according to the traditional marketing theory or the relatively new network marketing theory. Complex network theory provides a new model for the study of large-scale complex systems, using the latest developments of graph theory and computing techniques. From this perspective, the present paper extends the complex network theory and modeling into the research of general viral marketing and develops a specific spreading scheme for viral marking and an approach to design the scheme based on a real complex network on the \{QQ\} instant messaging system. This approach is shown to be rather universal and can be further extended to the design of various spreading schemes for viral marketing based on different instant messaging systems. }}

However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also discuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks. }}

To show the usefulness of this approach in practice, we also carry out numerical simulations on some concrete complex networks. Our results are completely consistent with the previous conclusions derived by graph theory methods. Furthermore, we show that the first excited state appears always on the largest connected component of the network.

Graph theoretic analysis has been extensively applied to study the dynamics of functional brain networks in the recent years. The selection of appropriate thresholding methods to construct weighted/unweighted subnetworks to detect cognitive load induced changes in brain׳s electrical activity remains an open challenge in the functional brain network research. This paper reviews the application of statistical and information theoretic metrics to construct the functional brain networks, proposes a novel Branch-and-Bound based thresholding algorithm that extracts the influential subnetwork, and applies efficient computational techniques and complex network metrics to detect and quantify the cognitive activities. The empirical analyses showcase the efficiency of the proposed thresholding algorithm by highlighting the changing neuronal patterns during cognitive activity when compared to that of baseline activity. Statistical evaluation of the results further validates the efficiency of the proposed method as well. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm in detecting subtle cognitive load induced changes in functional brain networks. }}

In general, when Ω ( c ) reaches its local maximum, especially the first one, the corresponding number of communities c is likely to be optimal in community detection. Moreover, the statistic Ω ( c ) can also measure the significance of community structures in complex networks, which has been paid more attention recently. Numerical and empirical results show that the index Ω ( c ) is effective in both artificial and real world networks. }}

These results have been obtained both considering exchanges between nearest neighbors or in a mean field scheme. In the present paper we study the effect of distributing the agents on a complex network. We have considered archetypical complex networks: Erdös–Rényi random networks and scale-free networks. The presence of a poverty line with finite wealth is preserved but spatial correlations are important, particularly between the degree of the node and the wealth. We present a detailed study of the correlations, as well as the changes in the Gini coefficient, that measures the inequality, as a function of the type and average degree of the considered networks. }}

A brain complex network analysis approach was used to assess the time-varying topological properties of the functional networks extracted from the electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Late \{L2\} learners showed a lower degree of parallel information transfer and a slower propagation between regions of the brain functional networks while processing sentences containing a gender mismatch condition as compared with a standard sentence configuration. In contrast, no such differences between these conditions were detected in the Spanish monolinguals. This indicates that when a morphosyntactic language incongruence that does not exist in the native language is presented in the second language, the neural activation pattern is configured differently in highly proficient late bilinguals than in monolinguals. }}

Increasing either average node degree or homogeneity of degree distribution will facilitate epidemic spreading. When packet generation rate ρ is small, increasing ρ favors epidemic spreading.

However, it may suffer from a bad choice of initial seeds (also called centers) that seriously affect the clustering accuracy and the convergence rate. Additionally, in K-means, the number of communities should be specified in advance. Till now, it is still an open problem on how to select initial seeds and how to determine the number of communities. In this study, a new parameter-free community detection method (named K-rank-D) was proposed. First, based on the fact that good initial seeds usually have high importance and are dispersedly located in a network, we proposed a modified PageRank centrality to evaluate the importance of a node, and drew a decision graph to depict the importance and the dispersion of nodes. Then, the initial seeds and the number of communities were selected from the decision graph actively and intuitively as the ‘start’ parameter of K-means. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over competing methods for community detection. }}

The first provides a general summary of the fracture network through the description of the number of nodes, edges, diameter, radius, lengths and clustering coefficients. A second group of features centers on the description of communicability in the network by means of three indexes recently proposed. In addition, we apply centrality measures (betweenness, closeness, eigenvector and eccentricity) for quantifying the importance of nodes in the entire network. Finally, we identify a topology for fracture networks using a classification based on the degree of communicability. The most important results obtained in this work are focused in the topological characteristic patterns found in fracture networks applying the approach of complex networks that in general provide local and global parameters of connectivity and communicability. }}

In this paper, we propose an efficient method for adjusting these classical algorithms to match the requirement for discovering overlapping communities in complex networks, which is based on a local definition of community strength. The method can in principle be applied with any clustering algorithm. Tests on a set of computer generated and real-world networks give excellent results.

This paper addresses the heart issue about how to choose pinning nodes for pinning control, where pinning control aims to control a network to an identical state by injecting feedback control signals to a small fraction of nodes. We explore networks’ controllability from not only mathematical analysis, but also the aspects of network topology and information diffusion. Then, the connection between pinning control and information diffusion is given, and pinning node selection is transferred into multi-spreader problem in information diffusion. Based on information diffusion, a heuristic method is proposed to select pinning nodes by optimizing the spreading ability of multiple spreaders. The proposed method greatly improves the controllability of large practical networks, and provides a new perspective to investigate pinning node selection. }}

When the network grows to some certain size, we introduce an SIR-like disease such as pandemic influenza H1N1/09 to the population. Due to its rapid spread, the population size changes slowly, and thus the disease spreads on correlated networks with approximately fixed size. To predict the disease evolution on correlated networks, we first review two node-based \{SIR\} models incorporating degree correlations and an edge-based \{SIR\} model without considering degree correlation, and then compare the predictions of these models with stochastic \{SIR\} simulations, respectively. We find that the edge-based model, even without considering degree correlations, agrees much better than the node-based models incorporating degree correlations with stochastic \{SIR\} simulations in many respects. Moreover, simulation results show that for networks with positive correlation, the edge-based model provides a better upper bound of the cumulative incidence than the node-based \{SIR\} models, whereas for networks with negative correlation, it provides a lower bound of the cumulative incidence. }}

Subsequently, one by one, all communities in the network are obtained by repeating this process. The use of the local information in the proposed algorithm directly leads to the reduction of complexity. The algorithm runs in O ( n + m ) time for a general network and O ( n ) for a sparse network, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in a network. The algorithm fast produces the desired results when applied to search for communities in a benchmark and five classical real-world networks, which are widely used to test algorithms of community detection in the complex network. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, neither global modularity nor local modularity is utilized in the proposal. By converting the considered problem into a graph, the proposed algorithm can also be applied to solve other cluster problems in data mining. }}

Our results indicate that the evolution of investors’ behavior is affected by the network structure of stock market and the effect of risk dominance degree of investment behavior; the stability of equilibrium states of investors’ behavior dynamics is directly related with the risk dominance degree of some behavior; connectivity and heterogeneity of the network plays an important role in the evolution of the investment behavior in stock market. }}

Firstly, the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) of degree generated by \{EVC\} is modified according to the actual degree distribution, rather than just following uniform distribution. \{BPA\} is the generation of probability in order to model uncertainty. Secondly, semi-local centrality combined with modified \{EVC\} is extended to be applied in weighted networks. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. }}

In this review, we present a relevant panel of candidate genes related to the immune system in the context of solid organ transplantation; we discuss the most convincing reports of genetic associations with outcomes in renal transplantation and highlight the most promising loci among the vast body of literature. }}

Each infected individual is allowed to select a limited number of neighbors to contact, and a tunable parameter is introduced to control the preference to contact through high-weight or low-weight edges. Simulation results on six real networks show that the epidemic prevalence can be largely promoted when strong ties are favored. By comparing with two statistical null models, we show that the distribution pattern of weights, rather than the topological structure, mainly contributes to the observations. Further analysis suggests that the weight–weight correlation strongly affects the results: high-weight edges are more significant in keeping high epidemic prevalence when the weight–weight correlation is positive. }}

Compared with the widely used Pearson coefficient, Spearman coefficient is rank-based, nonparametric, and size-independent. Thus it is more effective to assess linking patterns of diverse networks, especially for large-size networks. We demonstrate this point by testing a variety of empirical and artificial networks. Moreover, we show that normalized Spearman ranks of stubs are subject to an interesting linear rule where the correlation coefficient is just the Spearman coefficient. This compelling linear relationship allows us to directly produce networks with any prescribed Spearman coefficient. Our method apparently has an edge over the well known uncorrelated configuration model. }}

Conventional literatures analyze the network reliability assuming that the failure rates of all components in networks following the same membership function. However, most real-world networks do not abide by this regulation, especial complex ones. Therefore, in this paper, a new method is developed based on cellular automata (CA) and fuzzy logic following different types of fuzzy failure rates. The proposed method has two separate processing procedures: the computing of fuzzy numbers (CFN) and the decomposing model based on cellular automata (DB-CA). The combination of these procedures can be used to topology decomposition and the fuzzy reliability evaluation of any real network. Finally, The proposed method is improved by numerical network examples with a variety of membership functions, and the benchmark water delivery network in Shelby county is provided to estimate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. }}

P d reflects the interactive effect between the weight fluctuation and variation of nodes and links (topological structure) for each real network. For airport networks the exponent β is 0.4 and the creation probability P d is equal to 0.018 (China), 0.025 (US), 0.03 (Brazil) and 0.04 (Europe). This model quantitatively describes and reproduces these real airport networks. }}

In order to avoid congestion, we minimize the maximum betweenness, which is a measure for concentration of routing paths passing through a node in the network. Danila et al. propose a packet routing strategy in which, instead of shortest paths, they used efficient paths, which are the paths with the minimum total summations of weights assigned to nodes in the respective paths. They use a heuristic algorithm in which the weights are updated step by step by using the information of betweenness of each node in every step and the respective total summations of weights for paths through the nodes with large degrees become comparatively large. Thus passage through such nodes, where congestion almost occurs, is likely to be avoided in their algorithm. The convergence time by their algorithm is, however, quite long. In this paper, we propose a new efficient heuristic algorithm which balances traffic on networks by achieving minimization of the maximum betweenness in the much smaller number of iteration steps for convergence than that by the algorithm of Danila et al. }}

The energy parameters of protein dynamics we considered are bonded potential, angle potential, dihedral potential, improper potential, kinetic energy, Van der Waals potential, electrostatic potential, total energy and potential energy. The shape of the h ( q ) curves from MF-DFA indicates that these time series are multifractal. The numerical values of the exponent h ( 2 ) of MF-DFA show that the series of total energy and potential energy are non-stationary and anti-persistent; the other time series are stationary and persistent apart from series of pressure (with H ≈ 0.5 indicating the absence of long-range correlation). The degree distributions of their converted \{HVGs\} show that these networks are exponential. The results of fractal analysis show that fractality exists in these converted HVGs. For each energy, pressure or volume parameter, it is found that the values of h ( 2 ) of MF-DFA on the time series, exponent λ of the exponential degree distribution and fractal dimension d B of their converted \{HVGs\} do not change much for different proteins (indicating some universality). We also found that after taking average over all proteins, there is a linear relationship between 〈 h ( 2 ) 〉 (from MF-DFA on time series) and 〈 d B 〉 of the converted \{HVGs\} for different energy, pressure and volume. }}

Comparative analysis is conducted for different years, which indicates that the survivability of China flight flow network has an increasing trend and the network is more dependent on several key airports. Comparative analysis is also made for various attacks, which demonstrates that the flight flow network has strong robustness against random attack, but is vulnerable to deliberate attack. The reliability of the entire network is dominated by a few major airports, thus, the safe and effective operation of these airports should be ensured and it is essential to build some multi-hub systems in the future. }}

In this paper, we apply a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based analysis technique on \{EEG\} data, captured during face perception tasks, to explore the temporal evolution of phase synchronization, from the onset of a stimulus. Our explorations show that there exists a small set (typically 3–5) of unique synchronized patterns or synchrostates, each of which are stable of the order of milliseconds. Particularly, in the beta ( β ) band, which has been reported to be associated with visual processing task, the number of such stable states has been found to be three consistently. During processing of the stimulus, the switching between these states occurs abruptly but the switching characteristic follows a well-behaved and repeatable sequence. This is observed in a single subject analysis as well as a multiple-subject group-analysis in adults during face perception. We also show that although these patterns remain topographically similar for the general category of face perception task, the sequence of their occurrence and their temporal stability varies markedly between different face perception scenarios (stimuli) indicating toward different dynamical characteristics for information processing, which is stimulus-specific in nature. Subsequently, we translated these stable states into brain complex networks and derived informative network measures for characterizing the degree of segregated processing and information integration in those synchrostates, leading to a new methodology for characterizing information processing in human brain. The proposed methodology of modeling the functional brain connectivity through the synchrostates may be viewed as a new way of quantitative characterization of the cognitive ability of the subject, stimuli and information integration/segregation capability. }}

abstract = {The classification of texts has become a major endeavor with so much electronic material available, for it is an essential task in several applications, including search engines and information retrieval. There are different ways to define similarity for grouping similar texts into clusters, as the concept of similarity may depend on the purpose of the task. For instance, in topic extraction similar texts mean those within the same semantic field, whereas in author recognition stylistic features should be considered. In this study, we introduce ways to classify texts employing concepts of complex networks, which may be able to capture syntactic, semantic and even pragmatic features. The interplay between various metrics of the complex networks is analyzed with three applications, namely identification of machine translation (MT) systems, evaluation of quality of machine translated texts and authorship recognition. We shall show that topological features of the networks representing texts can enhance the ability to identify \{MT\} systems in particular cases. For evaluating the quality of \{MT\} texts, on the other hand, high correlation was obtained with methods capable of capturing the semantics. This was expected because the golden standards used are themselves based on word co-occurrence. Notwithstanding, the Katz similarity, which involves semantic and structure in the comparison of texts, achieved the highest correlation with the \{NIST\} measurement, indicating that in some cases the combination of both approaches can improve the ability to quantify quality in MT. In authorship recognition, again the topological features were relevant in some contexts, though for the books and authors analyzed good results were obtained with semantic features as well. Because hybrid approaches encompassing semantic and topological features have not been extensively used, we believe that the methodology proposed here may be useful to enhance text classification considerably, as it combines well-established strategies. }}

The first investigation reveals that the outage of the second (backup) 400 kV Bina–Gwalior–Agra line on 29 July 2012 led to the cascading failure through the grid, which can be simulated and explained from the perspective of the complex networks theory. In this paper, a new model of a power grid involving the active and reactive power loads is proposed and then used to analyze the cascading behavior of power grids, which is also used to explain the reason of the blackout happening in India. Furthermore, some strategic advices are given for improving the stability and security of power grids, especially Indian power grids. }}

It is found that the effect of the deviation depends on the network randomness p (the fraction of random shortcuts): for larger p (p &gt; 0.15), the spiking regularity keeps being improved with increasing q; while, for smaller p (p &lt; 0.15), the spiking regularity can reach the best performance at an optimal intermediate q value, indicating the occurrence of “deviation-optimized spike coherence”. The synchronization becomes enhanced with decreasing q, and the enhancing extent for a random \{HH\} neuron network is stronger than for a regular one. These behaviors show that the spike coherence and synchronization of the present \{HH\} neurons on random networks can be more strongly enhanced by various other types of external noise than by Gaussian noise, whereby the neuron firings may behave more periodically in time and more synchronously in space. Our results provide the constructive roles of the \{NGN\} on the spiking activity of the present system of \{HH\} neuron networks. }}

This model consists in sampling a random bipartite graph with prescribed degree distribution. Indeed, we show that any complex network may be viewed as a bipartite graph with some specific characteristics, and that its main properties may be viewed as consequences of this underlying structure. We also propose a growing model based on this observation. }}

In this model, the initial node loads are defined as a nonlinear function of the generalized betweenness with a power exponent α , and the local distribution strategy is adopted to assign the failed nodes’ loads to their neighbors. In frame of the \{BA\} network, an interesting conclusion is reached through numerical simulations: there is a threshold α T ≈ 0.6 , in the case of α &gt; α T , attacking the nodes with larger loads is more prone to large scale cascading failures; while for α &lt; α T , attacking the nodes with smaller loads will more easily lead to the whole network’s paralysis. Finally, we indicate that this phenomenon is rooted in the differences of initial loads distribution for different values of α . }}

First, the cumulative distributions of weighted degree, degree, number of routes that connect to each station, and node weight (peak-hour trips at a station) uniformly follow the exponential law. Meanwhile, the node weight shows positive correlations with the corresponding weighted degree, degree, and number of routes that connect to a station. Second, a new richness parameter of a node is explored by its node weight and the connectivity, weighted connectivity, average shortest path length and efficiency between rich nodes can be fitted by composite exponential functions to demonstrate the rich-club phenomenon. }}

By means of the presented controllers and corresponding update laws, the outer synchronization between two complex delayed networks with adaptive coupling can be achieved without calculating the eigenvalues of the coupling configuration matrix. Simultaneously, the outer coupling matrix of the network and the system parameters of node dynamics are also identified.

The immune system is a complex network involving immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, and the complement system. Monitoring and ideally influencing the allo-response of the organ recipient against the donor antigens may help to personalize the immunosuppressive therapy including the disclosure of those patients who are suitable for weaning or even discontinuation of immunosuppression.

abstract = {Abstract Community detection is a topic of interest in the study of complex networks such as the protein–protein interaction networks and metabolic networks. In recent years, various methods were proposed to detect community structures of the networks. Here, a kind of local modularity with tunable parameter is derived from the Newman–Girvan modularity by a special self-loop strategy that depends on the community division of the networks. By the self-loop strategy, one can easily control the definition of modularity, and the resulting modularity can be optimized by using the existing modularity optimization algorithms. The local modularity is used as the target function for community detection, and a self-consistent method is proposed for the optimization of the local modularity. We analyze the behaviors of the local modularity and show the validity of the local modularity in detecting community structures on various networks. }}

abstract = {Abstract Cascading failures in interconnected networks have received more and more attention. In previous works, the basic assumption is that networks share the same capacity redundancy. However, this setting cannot capture the real case very well. Hence, in this paper, we analyze the effect of capacity redundancy disparity on the robustness of interconnected networks. In isolated networks, it is well known that the complex network’s robustness can be improved by increasing its capacity redundancy. In interconnected networks where two networks share the same capacity redundancy, the similar result holds. Yet this result is not necessarily true in interconnected networks where two networks are different in capacity redundancy. We find that when the capacity redundancy of one network is fixed, the robustness of the whole system may not follow another network’s capacity redundancy. More specifically, when the fixed network’s capacity redundancy is very small or very large, the robustness of the whole system increases as another network’s capacity redundancy increases. But there exists a certain range within which the increase of one network’s capacity redundancy results in the robustness decline of the whole system. This counterintuitive feature appears under different coupling patterns such as assortative, disassortative, or random coupling. This result advances our understanding of the robustness of interconnected networks. }}

The obtained result implies that the network will achieve exponential synchronization for appropriate communication delays if the network’s weighted adjacency matrix is of scrambling property and the coupling strength is large enough. Note that, our synchronization condition is very new, which would be easy to check in comparison with those previously reported LMIs. Moreover, we extend the result to the case when the interaction topology is switching. The maximal allowable upper bounds of communication delays are obtained in each case.

However, few efforts have been made to use node diversity within network structures to measure spreading ability. The two-step framework described in this paper uses a robust and reliable measure that combines global diversity and local features to identify the most influential network nodes. Results from a series of Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) epidemic simulations indicate that our proposed method performs well and stably in single initial spreader scenarios associated with various complex network datasets. }}

In our study, we analyze the potential impact of carpooling as a collective phenomenon emerging from people׳s mobility, by network analytics. Based on big mobility data from travelers in a given territory, we construct the network of potential carpooling, where nodes correspond to the users and links to possible shared trips, and analyze the structural and topological properties of this network, such as network communities and node ranking, to the purpose of highlighting the subpopulations with higher chances to create a carpooling community, and the propensity of users to be either drivers or passengers in a shared car. Our study is anchored to reality thanks to a large mobility dataset, consisting of the complete one-month-long \{GPS\} trajectories of approx. 10% circulating cars in Tuscany. We also analyze the aggregated outcome of carpooling by means of empirical simulations, showing how an assignment policy exploiting the network analytic concepts of communities and node rankings minimizes the number of single occupancy vehicles observed after carpooling. }}

In this paper we study a possibility to simulate stochastic processes which move edges in a network leading to a scale-free structure. Scale-free networks are characterized by a “fat-tail” degree distribution with considerably higher presence of so called hubs – nodes with very high degree. To understand and predict very large networks it is important to study the possibility of parallel simulation. We consider a class of stochastic processes which keeps the number of edges in the network constant called equilibrium networks. This class is characterized by a preferential selection where the edge destinations are chosen according to a preferential function f(k) which depends on the node degree k. For this class of stochastic processes we prove that it is difficult if not impossible to design an exact parallel algorithm if the function f(k) is monotonous with an injective derivative. However, in the important case where f(k) is linear we present a fully scalable algorithm with almost linear speedup. The experimental results confirm the linear scalability on a large processor cluster. }}

However, we recently observe that various malicious information, such as computer virus and rumors, are broadly spread via social networks. To restrict these malicious information, it is critical to develop effective method to discover the diffusion source nodes in social networks. Many pioneer works have explored the source node identification problem, but they all based on an ideal assumption that there is only a single source node, neglecting the fact that malicious information are often diffused from multiple sources to intentionally avoid network audit. In this paper, we present a multi-source locating method based on a given snapshot of partially and sparsely observed infected nodes in the network. Specifically, we first present a reverse propagation method to detect recovered and unobserved infected nodes in the network, and then we use community cluster algorithms to change the multi-source locating problem into a bunch of single source locating problems. At the last step, we identify the nodes having the largest likelihood estimations as the source node on the infected clusters. Experiments on three different types of complex networks show the performance of the proposed method. }}

abstract = {Abstract In a recent work (Shao et al., 2009), a nonconsensus opinion (NCO) model was proposed, where two opinions can stably coexist by forming clusters of agents holding the same opinion. The \{NCO\} model on lattices and several complex networks displays a phase transition behavior, which is characterized by a large spanning cluster of nodes holding the same opinion appears when the initial fraction of nodes holding this opinion is above a certain critical value. In the \{NCO\} model, each agent will convert to its opposite opinion if there are more than half of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood. In this paper, we generalize the \{NCO\} model by assuming that each agent will change its opinion if the fraction of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood exceeds a threshold T ( T ≥ 0.5 ). We call this generalized model as the \{NCOT\} model. We apply the \{NCOT\} model on different network structures and study the formation of opinion clusters. We find that the \{NCOT\} model on lattices displays a continuous phase transition. For random graphs and scale-free networks, the \{NCOT\} model shows a discontinuous phase transition when the threshold is small and the average degree of the network is large, while in other cases the \{NCOT\} model displays a continuous phase transition. }}

abstract = {Abstract Random simulations from complicated combinatorial sets are often needed in many classes of stochastic problems. This is particularly true in the analysis of complex networks, where researchers are usually interested in assessing whether an observed network feature is expected to be found within families of networks under some hypothesis (named conditional random networks, i.e., networks satisfying some linear constraints). This work presents procedures to generate networks with specified structural properties which rely on the solution of classes of integer optimization problems. We show that, for many of them, the constraints matrices are totally unimodular, allowing the efficient generation of conditional random networks by specialized interior-point methods. The computational results suggest that the proposed methods can represent a general framework for the efficient generation of random networks even beyond the models analyzed in this paper. This work also opens the possibility for other applications of mathematical programming in the analysis of complex networks. }}

Here, by developing a series of algorithms, this study provided a whole anatomical neural network of the macaque monkey. Then, the drifts in centrality from normal to \{PD\} networks were described in terms of complex network analysis and summarized with principal component analysis. Results revealed that the areas including the striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, prefrontal lobe, thalamus, hippocampus, visual cortex, insula, etc., showed relatively notable drifts in their own patterns. The present study also demonstrated that the current targets of \{DBS\} shared a common feature: their centrality values being relatively low in the normal brain while intensely drifting with PD. }}

We propose a model to grow scale-free networks with tunable motif distributions through a combined operation of preferential attachment and triad motif seeding steps. Numerical experiments show that the constructed networks have adjustable distributions of the local triad motifs, meanwhile preserving the global features of power-law distributions of node degree, short average path lengths of nodes, and highly clustered structures. }}

The overall topological structures and functional features of a public transportation network, therefore, must be fully understood to assist the safety management of rail transit and planning for sustainable development. Based on the complex network theory, this study took the Beijing Subway system (BSS) as an example to assess the robustness of a subway network in face of random failures (RFs) as well as malicious attacks (MAs). Specifically, (1) the topological properties of the rail transit system were quantitatively analyzed by means of a mathematical statistical model; (2) a new weighted composite index was developed and proved to be valid for evaluation of node importance, which could be utilized to position hub stations in a subway network; (3) a simulation analysis was conducted to examine the variations in the network performance as well as the dynamic characteristics of system response in face of different disruptions. The results reveal that the \{BSS\} exhibits typical characteristics of a scale-free network, with relatively high survivability and robustness when faced with RFs, whereas error tolerance is relatively low when the hubs undergo MAs. In addition, illustrations of dynamic variations in the influence of the \{BSS\} under a series of \{MAs\} were provided by spatial analysis techniques of Geographical Information System (GIS), which directly verified the earlier conclusions. We believed the proposed methodology and the results obtained could contribute to a baseline for relevant research of transportation topological robustness. }}

We prove exact relations among the thus defined node displacement, the information centrality and the Kirchhoff index.

This paper addresses these technique questions. Surprisingly, it is found that a network under a typical framework can realize synchronization subject to any linear feedback pinning scheme by using adaptive tuning of the coupling strength. In addition, it is found that the nodes with low degrees should be pinned first when the coupling strength is small, which is contrary to the common view that the most-highly-connected nodes should be pinned first. Furthermore, it is interesting to find that the derived pinning condition with controllers given in a high-dimensional setting can be reduced to a low-dimensional condition without the pinning controllers involved. Finally, simulation examples of scale-free networks are given to verify the theoretical results. }}

We have been exploring the efficacy of techniques from complex networks to the study of dense granular materials as a means to: (i) uncover such design principles and (ii) identify suitable metrics that quantify the evolution of structure during deformation. Herein, we characterize the developing network structure and loss of connectivity in a quasistatically deforming granular medium from the perspective of complex networks. Attention is paid to the evolution of the contact and contact force networks at the local or mesoscopic level, i.e., a particle and its immediate neighbors, as well as the macroscopic level. We explore network motifs and other topological properties at these multiple length scales, in an attempt to find that which best correlates with the constitutive properties of nonaffine deformation and dissipation, spatially and with respect to strain. Key processes or rearrangement events that cause loss of connectivity within the material domain, e.g. microbanding and force chain buckling, are investigated. Network statistics of these processes, previously shown to be major sources of energy dissipation and nonaffine deformation, are then tied to corresponding trends observed in the evolving macroscopic network. It is shown that consideration of the unweighted contact network alone is insufficient to tie dissipation to loss of material connectivity. }}

Preferential attachment in the \{BA\} model operates on the assumption that a node which has more links has a better likelihood to create new links. In this work, we expand the \{PA\} mechanism by treating it as a cyclic mechanism which is linked to both direct and indirect neighbours of a node. The assumption behind this extension is that the preference of nodes is influenced by their indirect neighbours as well. We show that traditional \{PA\} can be absorbed as a special case of this new growth model, which we name ‘cyclic preferential attachment’ (CPA). We also discuss the properties of simulated networks that were generated based on CPA. Finally, we compare and contrast the \{CPA\} based networks with the traditional \{PA\} based networks and several real-world networks of similar sizes and link-to-node ratios, and show that \{CPA\} offers more flexibility in modeling real world networks. }}

This paper reveals a new measure for assessing the influence effect based on influence scope maximization, which can complement the traditional measure of the expected number of influenced nodes. A novel method for identifying influential nodes in complex networks with community structure is proposed. This method uses the information transfer probability between any pair of nodes and the k-medoid clustering algorithm. The experimental results show that the influential nodes identified by the k-medoid method can influence a larger scope in networks with obvious community structure than the greedy algorithm without reducing the expected number of influenced nodes. }}

The main focus of this paper is, however, the devising of survival strategies through selective networking, to alter the fate of an arbitrarily chosen cluster: whether this be to revive a dying cluster to life, or to make a weak survivor into a stronger one. Although such goals are typically achieved by networking with relatively small clusters, our results suggest that it ought to be possible also to network successfully with peers and larger clusters. The main indication of this comes from the probability distributions of mass differences between survivors and their immediate neighbours, which show an interesting universality; they suggest strategies for winning against the odds. }}

Moreover, the frictional interface is mapped in the global–local parameter space of the corresponding functional friction network, showing the evolution path and, eventually, the residual stage. Furthermore, we show that with respect to shear direction, parallel aperture patches are more adaptable to environmental stimuli than perpendicular profiles. We characterize the pure-contact profiles using the same approach.

Then the time series are converted into complex networks by the visibility algorithm. The topological properties of the networks such as scale-free property and small-world effect imply that there is a close relationship among the numbers of repetitious behaviors performed by people during certain periods of time. Our work implies that there is intrinsic regularity in the human collective repetitious behaviors. The conclusions may be helpful to develop some new approaches to investigate the fractal feature and mechanism of human dynamics, and provide some references for the management and forecast of human collective behaviors. }}

Traditional node matching problem of networks always hypothesize that a proportion of matching nodes are known. However, if the ratio of matched nodes is very small, the matching accuracy of the remaining nodes cannot be evaluated accurately. What is more, we may have not any matched nodes for reference at all. In view of this, this paper established the mathematic model of node matching problem based on the adjacency matrixes of networks, and presented an evolutionary algorithm to solve it. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory matching precision in the absence of any matched nodes. }}

In this paper, we focus on the deterministic chaotic Rössler time series and stochastic noisy periodic data that yield substantially different structures of networks. In particular, we test an extensive range of network topology statistics, which have not been discussed in previous work, but which are capable of providing a comprehensive statistical characterization of the dynamics from different angles. Our goal is to find out how they reflect and quantify different aspects of specific dynamics, and how they can be used to distinguish different dynamical regimes. For example, we find that the joint degree distribution appears to fundamentally characterize spatial organizations of cycles in phase space, and this is quantified via an assortativity coefficient. We applied network statistics to electrocardiograms of a healthy individual and an arrythmia patient. Such time series are typically pseudoperiodic, but are noisy and nonstationary and degrade traditional phase-space based methods. These time series are, however, better differentiated by our network-based statistics. }}

Theoretical results indicate that the epidemic threshold of the random mobile network with diverse infection periods is larger than the counterpart with the same infection period. Moreover, the heterogeneity of individual susceptibility and infectivity can play a significant impact on disease transmission. In particular, the homogeneity of individuals will avail to the spreading of epidemics. Numerical examples verify further our theoretical results very well. }}

Disassortative coupling is more robust for sparse coupling while assortative coupling performs better for dense coupling. We provide an explanation for this constructive phenomenon via examining cascading process from the microscopic point of view.

In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of people in susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and rumor spreading dynamics. We first study the impact of community structure on people’s susceptibility. Although the community structure can reduce the number of infected people for same infection rate, it will not significantly affect nodes’ susceptibility. We find the susceptibility of individuals is sensitive to the choice of spreading dynamics. For \{SIR\} spreading, since the susceptibility is highly correlated to nodes’ influence, the topological indicator k -shell can better identify highly susceptible individuals, outperforming degree, betweenness centrality and PageRank. In contrast, in rumor spreading model, where nodes’ susceptibility and influence have no clear correlation, degree performs the best among considered topological measures. Our finding highlights the significance of both topological features and spreading mechanisms in identifying highly susceptible population. }}

By comparing the intensity and density of connections between the two networks, we find that high weight connections in Chinese language networks prevail more than those in English language networks. Furthermore, some of the topological and weighted quantities are compared. The results display some differences in the structural organizations between the two language networks. These observations indicate that the two languages may have different linguistic mechanisms and different combinatorial natures. }}

The minimum dominating set (MDS) approach has rapidly emerged as a promising algorithmic method to analyze complex biological networks integrated with human disorders, which can be composed of a variety of omics data, from proteomics and transcriptomics to metabolomics.

abstract = {Abstract Society is now, more than ever, highly dependent on the large-scale networks that underpin its functions. In relatively recent times, significant failures have occurred on large-scale networks that have a considerable impact upon sizable proportions of the world’s inhabitants. The failure of infrastructure has, in turn, begot a subsequent loss of services supported by that network. Consequently, it is now vitally important to evaluate the robustness of such networks in terms of the services supported by the network in question. Evaluating network robustness is integral to service provisioning and thus any network should include explicit indication of the impact upon service performance. Traditionally, network robustness metrics focused solely on topological characteristics, although some new approaches have considered, to a degree, the services supported by such networks. Several shortcomings of these new metrics have been identified. With the purpose of solving the drawbacks of these metrics, this paper presents a new measure called endurance, which quantifies the level of robustness supported by a specific topology under different types of multiple failure scenarios, giving higher importance to perturbations affecting low percentages of elements of a network. In this paper, endurance of six synthetic complex networks is computed for a range of defined multiple failure scenarios, taking into account the connection requests that cannot be satisfied. It is demonstrated that our proposal is able to quantify the robustness of a network under given multiple failure scenarios. Finally, results show that different types of networks react differently depending on the type of multiple failure. }}

The question which individuals should be immunized in order to mitigate the impact of the virus on the rest of population has received quite some attention in the literature. The dynamics of the of a virus spread through a population is often represented as information spread over a complex network. The strategies commonly proposed to determine which nodes are to be selected for immunization often involve only one centrality measure at a time, while often the topology of the network seems to suggest that a single metric is insufficient to capture the influence of a node entirely. In this work we present a generic method based on a genetic algorithm (GA) which does not rely explicitly on any centrality measures during its search but only exploits this type of information to narrow the search space. The fitness of an individual is defined as the estimated expected number of infections of a virus following \{SIR\} dynamics. The proposed method is evaluated on two contact networks: the Goodreau's Faux Mesa high school and the \{US\} air transportation network. The \{GA\} method manages to outperform the most common strategies based on a single metric for the air transportation network and its performance is comparable with the best performing strategy for the high school network. }}

Specifically, we remove approximately the longest simple path from a network iteratively until there are no paths left in the network. We propose two algorithms, the random augmenting approach (RPA) and the Hamilton-path based approach (HPA), for finding the approximately longest simple path in a network. Results demonstrate that steps of longest-path attacks increase with network density linearly for random networks, while exponentially increasing for scale-free networks. The more homogeneous the degree distribution is, the more fragile the network, which is different from the previous results of node or edge attacks. \{HPA\} is generally more efficient than \{RPA\} in the longest-path attacks of complex networks. These findings further help us understand the vulnerability of complex systems, better protect complex systems, and design more tolerant complex systems. }}

The statistical properties of directed weighted complex network are applied to reveal the critical factors, the key event chains and the important classes in DWACN. Analysis results demonstrate that \{DWACN\} has characteristics of small-world networks with short average path length and high weighted clustering coefficient, and display the properties of scale-free networks captured by that the cumulative degree distribution follows an exponential function. This modeling and analysis method can assist us to discover the latent rules of accidents and feature of faults propagation to reduce accidents. This paper is further development on the research of accident analysis methods using complex network. }}

First, we discover that steel products warehouse-out of different warehouses in a large-scale logistics system can be characterized by burst, and the warehouse-out inter-event time follows the power-law distribution with exponents close to α = 2.5 , which differs from the two classical models proposed by Barabasi (2005) and Vazquez (2005) respectively. By analyzing the warehouse-out inter-event time distribution of the products in one certain large-scale logistics system, we further discuss burst features and mechanisms of logistics system. Additionally, we find that in population behaviors, burst features can be explained by the priority that rooted in holidays and interior task scheduling. However, warehouse-out behaviors of active individuals do not show any features of burst. Further, we find that warehouse-out quantity of steel products follows Fractal Brownian motion with the \{HURST\} exponent higher than 0.5 by means of R / S , which infers that the quantity of products in a logistics system is not only guided by prices in the present market, but also related closely to the previous quantity of warehouse-out. Based on V statistic, we compare memory length of different products in warehouses. Finally, we apply complex networks visibility graphs for further validation of fractal features in a logistics system and find that almost every visibility graph exhibits small-world and scale-free features. Both R / S and complex networks visibility graphs reinforce that the warehouse-out quantity of products in a logistics system is not a random walk process, but contains intrinsic regularities and long-term correlation between present and previous warehouse-out quantity. }}

A new method based on the local degree central node to detect the local community is proposed. In our method, the local community is not discovered from the given starting node, but from the local degree central node that is associated with the given starting node.

Methods Magnetoencephalography measurements were conducted in 36 survivors of severe sepsis and septic shock three times within a time range of 12 months after discharge from intensive care unit. We analyzed steady state visual evoked responses using a set of familiar vs. unfamiliar pictures. Results Sepsis survivors exhibit oscillatory deficits in terms of an impaired response to periodic visual stimulation. Oscillatory deficits and neuropsychological impairments obtained by the DemTect questionnaire were strongly linked. Impaired responses were equally found during the presentation of familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. Compared to familiar stimuli however, the response to unfamiliar stimuli was significantly lower in the follow up but not in the post-acute stage. Conclusions We assume that the processing of unfamiliar pictures requires a higher amount of networking. In case of a disrupted network, complex networking might not be maintained. Significance Results indicate that neural synchrony might be restored to a certain level while more complex networking remains impaired. }}

The weak-factor operator is close to the well-known clique-graph operator but it rather operates in terms of bicliques in a multipartite graph. We address the problem of the termination of the series of graphs obtained by iteratively applying the weak-factor operator starting from a given input graph. As for the clique-graph operator, it turns out that some graphs give rise to series that do not terminate. Therefore, we design a slight variation of the weak-factor operator, called clean-factor, and prove that its associated series terminates for all input graphs. In addition, we show that the multipartite graph on which the series terminates has a very nice combinatorial structure: we exhibit a bijection between its vertices and the chains of the inclusion order on the intersections of the maximal cliques of the input graph. }}

On observation of the evolution of the maximum coreness, it is found that it has some sudden changes with the occurrence of major shocks. The highest core, which has high clustering characteristic, is tend to be located in the area that can directly or indirectly cause the major shocks. By comparing the energy distribution in each shell, we find that the energy proportion of the highest core is high, especially before the major shocks. }}

A mean distance between two nodes of degrees k i and k j in such networks equals to 〈 l ij 〉 = A - B log ( k i k j ) for a fixed value of the product k i k j . The scaling is valid over several decades. Parameters A and B depend on the mean value of a node degree 〈 k 〉 nn calculated for the nearest neighbors.

However it is still a challenging problem that has been addressed only with topological information in recent years. Based on the belief that network nodes with a great number of common neighbors are more likely to be connected, many similarity indices have achieved considerable accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by the natural assumption that the effect of missing links on the estimation of a node’s clustering ability could be related to node degree, in this paper, we propose a degree-related clustering coefficient index to quantify the clustering ability of nodes. Unlike the classical clustering coefficient, our new coefficient is highly robust when the observed bias of links is considered. Furthermore, we propose a degree-related clustering ability path (DCP) index, which applies the proposed coefficient to the link prediction problem. Experiments on 12 real-world networks show that our proposed method is highly accurate and robust compared with four common-neighbor-based similarity indices (Common Neighbors(CN), Adamic-Adar(AA), Resource Allocation(RA), and Preferential Attachment(PA)), and the recently introduced clustering ability (CA) index. }}

Our simulations presented that the quantitative relations between the Hurst indexes and the exponents of degree distribution function are different for different series and the visibility graph inherits some important features of the original time series. Further, we convert some quarterly macroeconomic series including the growth rates of value-added of three industry series and the growth rates of Gross Domestic Product series of China to graphs by the visibility algorithm and explore the topological properties of graphs associated from the four macroeconomic series, namely, the degree distribution and correlations, the clustering coefficient, the average path length, and community structure. Based on complex network analysis we find degree distributions of associated networks from the growth rates of value-added of three industry series are almost exponential and the degree distributions of associated networks from the growth rates of \{GDP\} series are scale free. We also discussed the assortativity and disassortativity of the four associated networks as they are related to the evolutionary process of the original macroeconomic series. All the constructed networks have “small-world” features. The community structures of associated networks suggest dynamic changes of the original macroeconomic series. We also detected the relationship among government policy changes, community structures of associated networks and macroeconomic dynamics. We find great influences of government policies in China on the changes of dynamics of \{GDP\} and the three industries adjustment.

Consequently, there exists a close connection between the human mobility pattern and the city's zones. However, it is not easy to collect large-scale society-wide data that can precisely capture the underlying relations between the individual's movement and the regional functions. Hence, our knowledge for understanding the basic patterns of human mobility is still limited. In order to discover the functions of different regions in a city, we propose an affinity based method in this paper. The affinity is a recently introduced metric for measuring the correlation of two connecting node in a complex network. The proposed model groups different functional zones by measuring user's arrival/departure distribution via relative entropy. In addition to this, we also identify the intensity of each functional zone by taking kernel density estimation (KDE) method. In the end, some experiments are conducted to evaluate our method with a large-scale real-life dataset, which consists of 3 million cellphone users' records from a period of one month. Our findings on the interaction between the mobility pattern and the regional functions can capture the city dynamics efficiently and provide a valuable reference for urban planners. }}

Firstly, a consensus control protocol under leaderless network is proposed. By applying the graph theory and LaSalle invariance principle, the protocol is proved feasible. Secondly, the consensus problem of heterogeneous multi-agent systems is discussed with a static leader and an active leader, respectively. Particularly, when the velocity of the active leader cannot be obtained in real time, a new neighbour-based consensus control protocol based on distributed observers and auxiliary systems is developed. Some sufficient conditions for consensus are established under fixed undirected connected topology. Finally, some examples were presented to illustrate the theoretical results. }}

Here, we perform framing analysis on a corpus of news texts on the population and family planning issue in the Philippines by operating two varying approaches: human-based and computer-assisted. A singular holistic approach to framing is initially implemented where coders/domain experts classify each news text to a specific pre-defined frame. This traditional approach is known to raise serious issues on the reliability and validity of the results mainly due to human’s intrinsic biases. To address such issues, we propose a novel technique that synergically combines the method of Matthes and Kohring (2008) and complex networks approach. In our model, the codings of texts are cast as a network of content analytic variables (CAVs). Our proposed method tackles the clustering issue that \{MK\} raised, which plagues framing scholars in the quantitative identification of news frames in texts. Moreover, the research is significant on a societal level as it also aims to gain perspective for reasons on the lack of progress in discussions about suitable population policies in most developing countries like the Philippines. }}

Heart failure can be explained as a complex, unstable, adaptive and self-organized biological phenomenon with intrinsic regulatory mechanisms. Recent findings The systems biology approach, that synthesizes information from biological molecules and networks involved in heart failure progression, leads from the regulatory modules of natriuretic peptide system and RAAS, to a more comprehensive network-based biological system with clinical significance. This kind of biological and clinical analysis of heart failure is based: a) in three fields of research or disciplines, modeling, omics and complex networks, and b) in the two directions of systems biology, functional composition (bottom–up direction) and functional decomposition (top–down direction). Summary This systems biology approach, with a new conceptual paradigm of heart failure progression and mechanisms, is explaining the physiological and pathological conditions of heart failure with an integrated and more meaningful method. }}

In the literature, much effort has been devoted to design new centrality measurements. However, the reliability of these centrality measurements has not been fully assessed, particularly with respect to the fact that many real networks are facing different kinds of manipulations such as addition, removal or rewiring of links. In this paper, we focus on the robustness of classic centrality measures against network manipulation. Our analysis is based on both artificial and real networks. We find that the centrality measurements are generally more robust in heterogeneous networks. Biased link manipulation could more seriously distort the centrality measures than random link manipulation. Moreover, the top part of the centrality ranking is more resistant to manipulation. }}

The simplest form of the community structure problem is the partitioning of unweighted and undirected networks into disjoint communities. However, module detection in weighted networks or communities with overlapping modules may lead to more realistic applications. Optimisation of the modularity metric is a popular method for community structure detection (Newman and Girvan 2004) and here we extend its use to propose mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models for (i) partitioning of weighted networks and (ii) detection of overlapping communities. The mathematical programming nature of the methods proposed provide users with an adaptability that may not be available in alternative modelling frameworks. Overall, we show that our methods improve existing methodologies in terms of applicability and adaptability and offer a versatile solution to the community detection problem. }}

In this paper, we propose a new weighted evolving network model.

Particularly, some other properties of the distributions, such as the droop-head and heavy-tail effects, can also be reflected by this model. }}

It is noticed that the synchronization speed sensitively depends on the adjustable positive constants μ i . Furthermore, the coupling configuration matrix is not necessary to be symmetric or irreducible, and the inner coupling matrix need not be symmetric. In addition, the node dynamic need not satisfy the very strong and conservative uniformly Lipschitz condition. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results. }}

One of the most important models has been proposed in Lieberman et al. (2005), adapting to a weighted directed graph the process described in Moran (1958). The Markov chain associated with the graph can be modified by erasing all non-trivial loops in its state space, obtaining the so-called Embedded Markov chain (EMC). The fixation probability remains unchanged, but the expected time to absorption (fixation or extinction) is reduced. In this paper, we shall use this idea to compute asymptotically the average fixation probability for complete bipartite graphs Kn,m. To this end, we firstly review some recent results on evolutionary dynamics on graphs trying to clarify some points. We also revisit the ‘Star Theorem’ proved in Lieberman et al. (2005) for the star graphs K1,m. Theoretically, \{EMC\} techniques allow fast computation of the fixation probability, but in practice this is not always true. Thus, in the last part of the paper, we compare this algorithm with the standard Monte Carlo method for some kind of complex networks. }}

The dynamical behaviour of each node on the consensus problem is also studied. It is found that the degree distribution of this new model represents a transition between power-law and exponential scaling, while the Barábasi–Albert scale-free model is only one of its special (limiting) cases.

Accordingly, we propose a so-called effective path index (EP) in this paper to leverage effective influence of endpoints and strong connectivity in similarity calculation. For demonstrating excellence of our index, the comparisons with six mainstream indices are performed on experiments in 15 real datasets and results show a great improvement of performance via our index. }}

These compounds promoted the synthesis and evaluation of new inhibitors for HMGR, named HMGRIs. The high number of possible candidates creates the necessity of Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship models in order to guide the \{HMGRI\} synthesis. There are two main problems of the reported \{QSAR\} models: the homogeneous series of the compounds and the chirality of many candidates. In this work, we propose for the first time a \{QSAR\} model for a very large and heterogeneous series of HMGRIs. The model is based on the Topological Indices (TIs) of molecular structures. Using the predictions of this model as input, we construct the first complex network that describes the drug–drug similarity relationships for more than 1600 experimentally non-explored chiral \{HMGRIs\} isomers. We also presented a reduced version of this network (Giant Component) that contains the most representative set of chiral \{HMGRI\} candidates. The work suggests a new mixed application in the \{QSAR\} study of relevant aspects of structural diversity by using chiral/non-chiral TIs, combined with complex networks. }}

This research combines the theory of complex networks with multi-agent modelling technology basis on the computer experimental methods, establishes a multi-agent simulation model of information diffusion in scale-free network environment, simulates the process of information diffusion and analyses delay characteristics of information diffusion in scale-free network environment. The results show that not all of the diffusion processes in scale-free network can simulated by third-order delay structure, when the value of M is relatively great we should consider using fourth- order delay structure to simulate the diffusion behaviours; In addition, the greater the value of the scale-free networks parameter M is, the shorter the corresponding average delay time of the delay function is. }}

In this article, we introduce a possible failure pattern of geographical networks–“regional failure”–by which nodes and edges within a region malfunction. Based on a previous spatial network model (Louf et al., 2013), we study the robustness of geographical networks against regional failure, which is measured by the fraction of nodes that remain in the largest connected component, via simulations. A small-area failure results in a large reduction of their robustness measure. Furthermore, we investigate two pre-deployed mechanisms to enhance their robustness: One is to extend the cost–benefit growth mechanism of the original network model by adding more than one link in a growth step, and the other is to strengthen the interconnection of hubs in generated networks. We measure the robustness-enhancing effects of both mechanisms on the basis of their costs, i.e., the amount of excessive links and the induced geographical length. The latter mechanism is better than the former one if a normal level of costs is considered. When costs exceed a certain level, the former has an advantage. Because the costs of excessive links affect the investment decision of real-world infrastructure networks, it is practical to enhance their robustness by adding more links between hubs. These results might help design robust geographical networks economically. }}

Another metric was derived from the dynamics of the network growth, based on the variation of the number of connected components. The scores assigned by the human judges according to three text quality criteria (coherence and cohesion, adherence to standard writing conventions and theme adequacy/development) were correlated with the network measurements. Text quality for all three criteria was found to decrease with increasing average values of outdegrees, clustering coefficient and deviation from the dynamics of network growth. Among the criteria employed, cohesion and coherence showed the strongest correlation, which probably indicates that the network measurements are able to capture how the text is developed in terms of the concepts represented by the nodes in the networks.

abstract = {Abstract Due to globalization, the characteristic of many systems in biology, engineering and sociology paradigms can nowadays be captured and investigated as networks of connected communities. Detecting natural divisions in such complex networks is proved to be extremely NP-hard problem that recently enjoyed a considerable interest. Among the proposed methods, the field of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) reveals outperformed results. Despite the existing efforts on designing effective multi-objective optimization (MOO) models and investigating the performance of several \{MOEAs\} for detecting natural community structures, their techniques lack the introduction of some problem-specific heuristic operators that realize their principles from the natural structure of communities. Moreover, most of these \{MOEAs\} evaluate and compare their performance under different algorithmic settings that may hold unmerited conclusions. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, to reformulate the community detection problem as a \{MOO\} model that can simultaneously capture the intra- and inter-community structures. Secondly, to propose a heuristic perturbation operator that can emphasize the search for such intra- and inter-community connections in an attempt to offer a positive collaboration with the \{MOO\} model. One of the prominent multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (the so-called MOEA/D) is adopted with the proposed community detection model and the perturbation operator to identify the overlapped community sets in complex networks. Under the same MOEA/D characteristic settings, the performance of the proposed model and test results are evaluated against three state-of-the-art \{MOO\} models. The experiments on real-world and synthetic social networks of different complexities demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model to define community detection problem. Moreover, the results prove the positive impact of the proposed heuristic operator to harness the strength of all \{MOO\} models in both terms of convergence velocity and convergence reliability. }}

Nodes in the same cluster are governed by the same dynamical function, while the functions for different clusters are different. For the coupling scheme, the effects of the coupling are assumed to be only cooperative, i.e., the coupling matrix is a Metzler matrix with zero row sums, and the connections between the same cluster can be few. For this type of coupling, the main difference of this paper with previous works is that the cluster synchronization is realized by pinning control technique. A simple pinning control strategy is proposed and some sufficient criteria to realize cluster synchronization with both static and adaptive control strength are given. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify our theoretical results. }}

Recently, network self-similarity as a natural outcome of the evolution of real-world systems has also attracted much attention within the physics literature. Here we investigate the scaling of density in complex networks under two classical box-covering renormalizations–network coarse-graining–and also different community-based renormalizations. The analysis on over 50 real-world networks reveals a power-law scaling of network density and size under adequate renormalization technique, yet irrespective of network type and origin. The results thus advance a recent discovery of a universal scaling of density among different real-world networks [P.J. Laurienti, K.E. Joyce, Q.K. Telesford, J.H. Burdette, S. Hayasaka, Universal fractal scaling of self-organized networks, Physica A 390 (20) (2011) 3608–3613] and imply an existence of a scale-free density also within–among different self-similar scales of–complex real-world networks. The latter further improves the comprehension of self-similar structure in large real-world networks with several possible applications. }}

In hyperbolic disk \{SEAM\} model determines the minimum angular range of a sector which possesses the maximal edge aggregation of nodes. The set of nodes within such sector has dense internal links, which corresponds with the characteristic of community structure. Based on \{SEAM\} model, we propose a fast community detection algorithm called Greedy Optimization Modularity Algorithm (GOMA) which employs greedy optimization strategy and hyperbolic coordinates. \{GOMA\} firstly divides initial communities according to the quantitative results of sector edge aggregation given by \{SEAM\} and the nodes’ hyperbolic coordinates, then based on greedy optimization strategy, only merges the two angular neighboring communities in hyperbolic disk to optimize the network modularity function, and consequently obtains high-quality community detection. The strategies of initial community partition and merger in hyperbolic space greatly improve the speed of searching the most optimal modularity. Experimental results indicate that \{GOMA\} is able to detect out high-quality community structure in synthetic and real networks, and performs better when applied to the large-scale and dense networks with strong clustering. }}

Such systems have a variety of sensory inputs that provide access to the richness, complexity, and noise of real-world signals. Specifically, the systems we design and implement are ab initio simulated spiking neural networks (SSNNs) with cellular resolution and complex network topologies that evolve according to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We desire to understand how external signals (like speech, vision, etc.) are encoded in the dynamics of such SSNNs. In particular, we are interested in identifying and confirming the extent to which various population-level measurements (or transforms) are information-preserving. Such transforms could be used as an unambiguous way of identifying the nature of the input signals, when given only access to the \{SSNN\} dynamics. Our primary objective in this paper is to empirically examine the extent to which a couple of graph metrics provide an information-preserving transform between the input signals and the output signals. In particular, we focus on the standard deviation of the time-varying distributions for local influence (weighted out-degree) and local impressionability (weighted in-degree), which provide insight into information encoding at the population-level in the dynamics of SSNNs. We report the encouraging results of an experiment carried out in the Language Acquisition and Robotics Group. }}

Understanding the composition of such networks requires an intricate decomposition of the network into modules, taking into account the manner in which network links are distributed among the nodes. There exists for each set of highly interlinked nodes little connectivity with the next set of highly interlinked nodes. This inherent property of nodes makes community detection a popular approach for analyzing the structure of complex networks. In this study, we attempt to understand the structure of the intraurban bus network of Ireland’s capital city, Dublin in a two-step approach. We first analyze the modular structure of the network by identifying potential communities. Secondly, we assess the prominence of each network node by examining the module-based topological properties of the nodes. Results of this empirical study reveal a clear pattern of independent communities, indicating thus, an implicit multi-community structure of the intraurban bus network. Examination of the geographic characteristics of the identified communities shows a degree of socio-economic divisions of the Dublin city. Furthermore, a large majority of the important nodes (vital transportation hubs) are located at the city center, implying that most of the bus lines in Dublin city tend to intersect the city’s core. }}

In this paper, we present a simple but effective similarity-based prediction strategy based on label propagation, which mimics the communication between people naturally. We perform an experimental comparison of the proposed method against four classic local similarity-based link prediction algorithms using real-world networks. The experimental results show that our method offers higher precision than these well-known approaches. Hence, we can provide more accurate friend recommendations for online social networks and reduce experimental costs in the fields of biology, and better understand the evolution mechanism of complex networks. }}

Connectivity in the data is extracted from the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of global correlations. We address the question whether removal of these nodes during the surgery is crucial in the suppression or reduction in the quantity of post-operative seizures. From five \{ECoG\} records, local areas with high synchronization power appear to be significantly involved in the development of epileptic seizures. The other two areas seem not to be fundamental in the seizures onset and development. Moreover, the approach proposed shed new light in cortical connectivity patterns in the human temporal lobe.

The experimental results on computer generated networks and real-world networks showed that our method makes a better tradeoff of accuracy and runtime. Based on the analysis of the results, we observe that the nontrivial closed walks of order three and four can be considered as the basic elements in constructing community structures. Meanwhile, we discover that those nontrivial closed walks outperform trivial closed walks in the task of analyzing the structure of networks. The double peak structure problem is mentioned in the last part of the article. We find that our proposed method is a novel way to solve the double peak structure problem.

An alternative node selection criterion is also proposed in order to study robustness and vulnerability of such complex networks, based on network efficiency. And lastly, a new procedure – the inverted adaptive strategy – is presented to sort the nodes in order to anticipate network breakdown. Finally, the robustness of the three alliance networks are analyzed with (1) a normalized multi-scale measure of vulnerability, (2) an adaptive strategy based on four different criteria and (3) an inverted adaptive strategy based on the efficiency criterion. The results show that Star Alliance has the most resilient route network, followed by SkyTeam and then oneworld. It was also shown that the inverted adaptive strategy based on the efficiency criterion – inverted efficiency – shows a great success in quickly breaking networks similar to that found with betweenness criterion but with even better results. }}

Two methods of attachment are considered; first, attachment of an edge between a newly created node and an existing node in the network, and secondly by attachment of an edge between two existing nodes. Splitting is also considered in two separate ways; first by selecting each node with equal probability and secondly, selecting the node with probability proportional to its degree. Exact solutions for the degree distributions are found and scale-free structure is exhibited in those networks where the candidates for splitting are chosen with uniform probability, those that are chosen preferentially are distributed with a power law with exponential cut-off. }}

abstract = {Abstract Typically, contagion strength is modeled by a transmission rate λ , whereby all nodes in a network are treated uniformly in a mean-field approximation. However, local agents react differently to the same contagion based on their local characteristics. Following our recent work (Montakhab and Manshour, 2012 [42]), we investigate contagion spreading models with local dynamics on complex networks. We therefore quantify contagions by their quality, 0 ⩽ α ⩽ 1 , and follow their spreading as their transmission condition (fitness) is evaluated by local agents. Instead of considering stochastic dynamics, here we consider various deterministic local rules. We find that initial spreading with exponential quality-dependent time scales is followed by a stationary state with a prevalence depending on the quality of the contagion. We also observe various interesting phenomena, for example, high prevalence without the participation of the hubs. This special feature of our “threshold rule” provides a mechanism for high prevalence spreading without the participation of “super-spreaders”, in sharp contrast with many standard mechanism of spreading where hubs are believed to play the central role. On the other hand, if local nodes act as agents who stop the transmission once a threshold is reached, we find that spreading is severely hindered in a heterogeneous population while in a homogeneous one significant spreading may occur. We further decouple local characteristics from underlying topology in order to study the role of network topology in various models and find that as long as small-world effect exists, the underlying topology does not contribute to the final stationary state but only affects the initial spreading velocity. }}

In Europe and Italy, scholars and practitioners have used landscape planning tools for the analysis and management of historical landscapes that include elements such as the sense of belonging of local societies to cultural heritage sites. In this paper the authors present a study of prehistoric settlements focusing on the Nuragic system developed on the Pranemuru plain in Sardinia during the Bronze Age. We investigate the hypothesis that the spatial patterns of the Nuraghes obey rules of inter-visibility control over the surrounding territory. We check the inter-visibility thesis by means of a quantitative approach, which integrates \{GIS\} based viewshed and complex network analysis. Nuragic inter-visibility is studied through network modelling and assessed with respect to a topological analysis. Results show a hierarchical organisation and not a random structure in the inter-visibility network: hence, consistent rules influenced the construction of Nuragic settlements on the Pranemuru plain. We conclude speculating that inter-visibility cannot be considered the sole factor that influenced the placement of Nuragic towers. The inter-visibility among these towers is plausibly connected with the presence of other human and natural resources. }}

The size of the domain is according to the magnitude of earthquake. In this way, the seismic data in the region of California are mapped to a topology of earthquake network. It is discovered that the earthquake networks in different time spans behave as scale-free networks. This result can be interpreted in terms of the Gutenberg–Richter law. Discovery of small-world characteristic is also reported on the earthquake network constructed by our method. The Omori law emerges as a feature of seismicity for the out-going links of the network. These characteristics highlight a novel aspect of seismicity as a complex phenomenon and will help us to reveal the internal mechanism of seismic system. }}

In errors nodes are randomly removed along with all their tipping edges, while in attacks the nodes with highest degrees are removed from the network. Interestingly, in many cases, the small-worldness of violated networks increased as more nodes underwent an attack. This indicates an important role of the hub nodes in controlling the small-worldness of Watts–Strogatz networks. The profile of changes in the small-worldness as a result of errors/attacks was independent of network size, while it was influenced by average degree and rewiring probability of Watts–Strogatz model. We also found that the pattern of the changes of the small-worldness in real-world networks is completely different than that of the Watts–Strogatz networks. Therefore, although Watts–Strogatz model is often used for constructing networks with small-world property, the resulting networks have different properties compared to real-world ones in terms of robustness in the small-worldness index against errors/attacks. }}

There are many drugs described with very different affinity to a large number of receptors. In this work, we selected Drug–Bacteria Pairs (DBPs) of affinity/non-affinity drugs with similar/dissimilar bacteria and represented it as a large network, which may be used to identify drugs that can act on bacteria. Computational chemistry prediction of the biological activity based on one-target Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (ot-QSAR) studies substantially increases the potentialities of this kind of networks avoiding time and resource consuming experiments. Unfortunately almost all ot-QSAR models predict the biological activity of drugs against only one bacterial species. Consequently, multi-tasking learning to predict drug's activity against different species with a single model (mt-QSAR) is a goal of major importance. These mt-QSARs offer a good opportunity to construct drug–drug similarity Complex Networks. Unfortunately, almost \{QSAR\} models are unspecific or predict activity against only one receptor. To solve this problem, we developed here a multi-bacteria \{QSAR\} classification model. The model correctly classifies 202 out of 241 active compounds (83.8%) and 169 out of 200 non-active cases (84.5%). Overall training predictability was 84.13% (371 out of 441 cases). The validation of the model was carried out by means of external predicting series, classifying the model 197 out of 221 (89.4%) cases. In order to show how the model functions in practice a virtual screening was carried out recognizing the model as active 86.7%, 520 out of 600 cases not used in training or predicting series. Outputs of this \{QSAR\} model were used as inputs to construct a network. The observed network has 1242 nodes (DBPs), 772,736 edges or \{DBPs\} with similar activity (sDBPs). The network predicted has 1031 nodes, 641,377 sDBPs. After edge-to-edge comparison, we have demonstrated that the predicted network is significantly similar to the observed one and both have distribution closer to exponential than to normal. }}

The empirical degree distribution of community graph has a unique nature, where it consists of two distinct parts, exponential and power law distribution. In this paper, we propose a modified model of community graph [Pollner et al. Europhys. Lett. 73 (2006) 478.] that mimics the empirical features of it. The growth mechanism of the model is a combination of preferential and non-preferential attachment in a higher level. We show that the model can reproduce the unique degree distribution by theoretical and numerical analysis. While such features might stem from some other reasons, we would expect to provide a unique aspect of community graph. }}

Then, we evaluate the properties of each node from the resulting networks by calculating the cumulative distribution of characteristic parameters such as degree, clustering coefficient, etc. Based on the maximum vertical distance of each pair of distributions, global similarity testing methods are proposed with consideration of the inhomogeneity of parameter distributions and the scale of the networks. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the strategy in terms of robustness and topological information mining.

Throughout these phases, the actors of the service ecosystem switch from a goods-dominant logic to a transitional logic and finally to a service-dominant logic. The actors of the service ecosystem are initially oriented towards dyadic-dominant relationships, but later move to triadic-dominant relationships, until all the actors of the complex network directly or indirectly interact with one another. }}

We show that considerable savings in computation time can be achieved by first filtering the input network based on correlations between cheap and more costly centrality metrics.

Existing studies show that the blackout size exhibits phase transitions as the loading level increases. This paper investigates the impact of the topology of a power grid on phase transitions in its robustness. Three spectral graph metrics are considered: spectral radius, effective graph resistance and algebraic connectivity. Experimental results from a model of cascading failures in power grids on the \{IEEE\} power systems demonstrate the applicability of these metrics to design/optimise a power grid topology for an enhanced phase transition behaviour of the system. }}

Over the past decade, with the advancement of data collection techniques, such as GPS, transit smart cards, and mobile phones, various types of travel trajectory data are increasingly complementing or replacing conventional travel diaries and stated preference data. Other location-aware data are used in studying human movement patterns, such as social network check-in data and banknote dispersal data. Abundance of the emerging trajectory data has driven a new wave of travel behaviour research, and introduced new research problems. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the travel behaviour studies categorised by trajectory data types. Based on the literature review, research challenges are discussed and promising research topics in this field are proposed for future studies. }}

The methods are applied to and evaluated with two biological network models, a simplified regulatory network for a switch with three interconnected positive circuits, and a more complex network for cell cycle control in Xenopus frog eggs. }}

Based on the finding that more than two miRNAs can target the same gene, we constructed a microRNA co-target network and analyzed it from the perspective of the complex network. We found that a network having a positive assortative mixing can be characterized by small-world and scale-free characteristics which are found in most complex networks. The network was further analyzed by the nearest-neighbor average connectivity, and it was shown that the more assortative a microRNA network is, the wider the range of increasing average connectivity. In particular, an assortative network has a power-law relationship of the average connectivity with a positive exponent. A percolation analysis of the network showed that, although the network is diluted, there is no percolation transition in the network. From these findings, we infer that the microRNAs in the network are clustered together, forming a core group. The same analyses carried out on different species confirmed the robustness of the main results found in the microRNA networks of humans. }}

This model requires only a small fraction of the total number of agents to use \{MC\} routes, and effectively mitigates congestion in networks under homogeneous or heterogeneous transport demand, offering new insights for improving the efficiency of practical transport networks. }}

While several such characterizations have already been obtained analytically (mostly for adjacency spectra), characterization of Laplacian spectra of direct product and strong product graphs has remained an open problem. Here we develop practical methods to estimate Laplacian spectra of direct and strong product graphs from spectral properties of their factor graphs using a few heuristic assumptions. Numerical experiments showed that the proposed methods produced reasonable estimation with percentage errors confined within a ± 10 % range for most eigenvalues. }}

By using the Lyapunov functional method, some delay-dependent synchronization criteria in terms of linear matrix inequality are proposed to ensure the mean square synchronization between the master system and the slave system. A singular value decomposition lemma is introduced to solve the control design problem for the case of the lower bound of neuron activation function is nonzero, which is different from the previous literature. Two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the limited network bandwidth could be saved by using the proposed design scheme. }}

In this article, the statistical features of China’s aviation system (CAS) are investigated through a complex network approach by examining weekly flight patterns. The correlation study proves the existence of a spatial hierarchical structure within China’s aviation network, which implies a more complex spatial mechanism. Subsequently the spatial structure of \{CAS\} is explored based on the flight distances between airport cities. In light of three measurements of node strength, population and GDP, It has been decided that the spatial effect of China’s aviation system should be analyzed separately in term of different distance scales. Only for medium- and long-distance travel, the flight patterns conform to a gravitation law; therefore, the distance dependence function can be generalized as a scaling relationship. In summary, from a complex network angle, this paper provides preliminary but enlightening insights to understanding the unique spatial mechanism of aviation systems. }}

A key step in this process is the development of noninvasive functional neuroimaging biomarkers that can be used to determine if nicotinic agents are eliciting their targeted biological effect, ideally through modulation of a fundamental aspect of neuronal function. To that end, neuroimaging researchers are beginning to understand how nicotinic modulation affects “intrinsic” brain networks to elicit potentially therapeutic effects. An intrinsic network is a functionally and (often) structurally connected network of brain areas whose activity reflects a fundamental neurobiological organizational principle of the brain. This review summarizes findings of the effects of nicotinic drugs on three topics related to intrinsic brain network activity: (1) the default mode network, a group of brain areas for which activity is maximal at rest and reduced during cognitive tasks, (2) the salience network, which integrates incoming sensory data with prior internal representations to guide future actions and change predictive values, and (3) multi-scale complex network dynamics, which describe these brain's ability to efficiency integrate information while preserving local functional specialization. These early findings can be used to inform future neuroimaging studies that examine the network effects of nicotinic agents. }}

By using the consensus convergence of a switched linear system associated with the switching topology, explicit bounds of the maximum deviation between nodes are obtained in the form of a scalar inequality involving the property of the consensus convergence, the homogeneous and heterogeneous dynamics of individual nodes for the local and global cases. These analytical results are simple yet generic, which can be used to explore synchronization issues of various complex networks. Finally, a numerical simulation illustrates their effectiveness. }}

Moreover, we identified topological regimes in which cooperation always prevails at short times, but where unconditional cooperators are favored over conditional tag-based helpers, even though the latter initially have a slight reproductive advantage. After very long times, we found that all four strategies appeared about equally often, meaning that only one quarter of agents refused cooperation egoistically. However, our study suggests that intra-tag generosity can quickly evolve to dominate over other strategies in spatially structured environments that are otherwise detrimental to cooperative behavior. }}

It is found that both the \{LNG\} and pipeline gas import and export trade networks display scale-free distributions, while the countries in the \{LNG\} trade network are linked more closely than those in the pipeline gas trade network. The markets in North America, Europe and Asia are not integrated, which indicates that a unified global natural gas market has not yet been formed. However, the degree of integration between the European and Asian markets is relative strong during 2000–2011. Finally, the integration among international natural gas markets and the inter-regional \{LNG\} trades are highly interrelated and mutually influencing. }}

In this paper, we define a heterogeneity index 0 ≤ H &lt; 1 to quantify the degree heterogeneity of any given network. We analytically show the existence of an upper bound of H = 0.5 for exponential networks, thus explain why exponential networks are homogeneous. On the other hand, we also analytically show that the heterogeneity index of an infinite power law network is between 1 and 0.5 if and only if its degree exponent is between 2 and 2.5. We further show that for any power law network with a degree exponent greater than 2.5, there always exists an exponential network such that both networks have the same heterogeneity index. This may help to explain why 2.5 is a critical degree exponent for some dynamic behaviors on power law networks. }}

Different from the research perspectives adopted in these works, the work presented in this paper treats software execution processes as an evolving complex network for the first time. The concept of software mirror graph is introduced as a new model of complex networks to incorporate the dynamic information of software behavior. The experimentation paradigm with statistical repeatability was applied to three distinct subject programs to conduct several software experiments. The corresponding experimental results are analyzed by treating the software execution processes as an evolving directed topological graph as well as an evolving software mirror graph. This results in several new findings. While the software execution processes may demonstrate as a small-world complex network in the topological sense, they no longer expose the small-world effects in the temporal sense. Further, the degree distributions of the software execution processes may follow a power law. However, they may also follow an exponential function or a piecewise power law. }}

For both models, we study the sequence of clogged roads up to the traffic gridlock and display the fragilities of the network. In the electrical model, by increasing the external potential, resistors burn out, as the voltage drop between the ends increases above a certain threshold. Analyzing both models, we observed some power-law functions that occur only near a traffic gridlock as well as the dependence on topological features of the network and influence on flux and the robustness in Apollonian networks of different generations. }}

By using the Lyapunov stability theory for a synchronization error system, asymptotic output synchronization of the overall networks can be established for the attenuated couplings even without any control input. Moreover, based on the adaptive regulation strategy, an approach for application of knowledge of electricity is proposed to physically realize the self-regulating networks. Finally, numerical simulations on a Rössler oscillator network are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived results. }}

Using techniques of complex-network theory, we study our system as a type of preferential-attachment model with fitness, and we analyze its macro behavior to clarify the properties of the city-size distributions it predicts. First, restricting the geographical fitness to take positive values and using a continuum approach, we show that the city-size distributions predicted by our model asymptotically approach Pareto distributions with coefficients greater than unity. Then, allowing the geographical fitness to take negative values, we perform local coefficient analysis to show that the predicted city-size distributions can deviate from Pareto distributions, as is often observed in actual city-size distributions. As a result, the model we propose can generate a generic class of city-size distributions, including but not limited to Pareto distributions. For applications to city-population projections, our simple model requires randomness only when new cities are created, not during their subsequent growth. This property leads to smooth trajectories of city population growth, in contrast to other models using Gibrat’s law. In addition, a discrete form of our dynamical equations can be used to estimate past city populations based on present-day data; this fact allows quantitative assessment of the performance of our model. Further study is needed to determine appropriate formulas for the geographical fitness. }}

abstract = {Prevailing models of the evolutionary prisoner’s game on networks always assume that agents are pursuing their own profit maximization. But the results from experimental games show that many agents have other-regarding preference. In this paper, we study the emergence of cooperation from the prisoner’s dilemma game on complex networks while some agents exhibit other-regarding preference such as inequality aversion, envious and guilty emotions. Contrary to common ideas, the simulation results show that the existence of inequality aversion agents does not promote cooperation emergence on a \{BA\} (Barabási and Albert) scale-free network in most situations. If the defection attraction is big and agents exhibit strong preference for inequality aversion, the frequency of cooperators will be lower than in situations where no inequality aversion agents exist. In some cases, the existence of the inequality agents will even induce the frequency of cooperators to zero, a feature which is not observed in previous research on the prisoner’s dilemma game when the underlying interaction topology is a \{BA\} scale-free network. This means that if an agent cares about equality too much, it will be difficult for cooperation to emerge and the frequency of cooperators will be low on \{BA\} networks. The research on the effect of envy or guilty emotions on the emergence of cooperation in the prisoner’s dilemma game on \{BA\} networks obtains similar results, though some differences exist. However, simulation results on a \{WS\} (Watts and Strogatz) small-world network display another scenario. If agents care about the inequality of agents very much, the \{WS\} network favors cooperation emergence in the prisoners’ dilemma game when other-regarding agents exist. If the agent weight on other-regarding is lowered, the cooperation frequencies emerging on a \{WS\} network are not much different from those in situations without other-regarding agents, although the frequency of cooperators is lower than those of the situation without other-regarding preference agents sometimes. All the simulation results imply that inequality aversion and its variations can have important effects on cooperation emergence in the prisoner’s dilemma game, and different network topologies have different effects on cooperation emergence in the prisoner’s dilemma game played on complex networks. }}

abstract = {Many networks of interest in the science, including social networks, computer networks and the World Wide Web, are found to be divided naturally into communities or groups. The problem of detecting communities is one of the outstanding issues in the study of network systems. Based on the improved shared nearest neighbor (SNN) similarity matrix, spectral method and fuzzy c -means (FCM) clustering algorithm, this paper proposes a new algorithm for detecting the communities in complex networks. The experiment reveals the validity of the presented method. The results are compared with other ones obtained by the different existing well methods and the conclusion is that the accuracy of the results calculated by this approach is much better than the known ones. }}

abstract = {Abstract Comprehensive and thorough supervision of all banking institutions under a Central Bank’s regulatory control has become necessary as recent banking crises show. Promptly identifying bank distress and contagion issues is of great importance to the regulators. This paper proposes a methodology that can be used additionally to the standard methods of bank supervision or the new ones proposed to be implemented. By this, one can reveal the degree of banks’ connectedness and thus identify “core” instead of just “big” banks. Core banks are central in the network in the sense that they are shown to be crucial for network supervision. Core banks can be used as gauges of bank distress over a sub-network and promptly raise a red flag so that the central bank can effectively and swiftly focus on the corresponding neighborhood of financial institutions. In this paper we demonstrate the proposed scheme using as an example the asset returns variable. The method may and should be used with alternative variables as well. }}

This paper initiates a novel approach for simultaneously identifying the topological structure and unknown parameters of uncertain general complex networks with time delay.

Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to monitor the on-line evolution of network topological structure.

The results indicate that oil trade has formed a global competition pattern and that the role played by the Asian-Pacific region in the evolution of this competition pattern is becoming increasingly prominent. In addition, global competition intensity has continued to rise, and non-OECD countries have become the main driving force for this increase in global competition intensity. The large oil importers are the most significant parts of the global oil-trading competition pattern. They are not only the major participants in the competition for oil resources but also play important roles in the transmission of oil-trading competition. China and the United States especially display the feature of globalization, whose impacts of transmission reach across the whole oil-trading competition network. Finally, a “5C” (changeability, contestability, cooperation, commitment and circumstances) policy framework is put forward to maintain the stability of oil trade and improve the energy security of oil importers in various aspects. }}

Consequently, we extend the concepts of subgraph centrality and clustering for complex networks represented by hypergraphs: complex hyper-networks. The first parameter characterizes the node participation in different sub-hypergraphs and the second one characterizes the transitivity in the hyper-network through the proportion of hyper-triangles to paths of length two. Another measure characterizing the formation of triples of mutually adjacent groups in the hyper-network is also introduced. All of these characteristics are studied in three different hyper-networks: a scientific collaboration hyper-network, an ecological competition hyper-network and the hyper-network formed by the American corporate elite in 1999. }}

The adaptive controllers are added to part of nodes, and the adaptive laws are depend on Markov chain and error states. Two numerical examples are exhibited to illustrate the validity of the theoretical results.

Interestingly, the networks which evolved under different learning rules showed different scalings with edge densities. The causal learning rule scaled similarly to its underlying graph (i.e. Erdös-Renyi random graph, in this study), on which a network can grow, while the Hebbian-like rule did not. }}

In this paper, the concept of pinning control in complex networks is applied to cluster data. Firstly, an adaptive method for constructing sparse and connected networks is proposed. Secondly, a dissimilarity measure is computed via a dynamic system in which vertices are expected to reach a consensus state regarding a reference trajectory. The reference is forced into the system by pinning control. A theoretical analysis was carried out to prove the convergence of the dynamic system under certain parameter constraints. The results using real data sets have showed that the proposed method performs well in the presence of clusters with different sizes and shapes comparing to some well-known clustering methods. }}

This paper investigates the properties of v / c in complex small-world and scale-free networks by introducing the congestion effects, described by link cost functions. The relationship between v / c and the degree of the node is mainly discussed. Finally, a simple strategy is presented to balance the tradeoff between traffic congestion and a waste of capacity. }}

Simulation results suggest that compared with the \{SW\} network, the \{SF\} network is more vulnerable to deliberate vertex attacks and more robust to deliberate edge attacks. In the \{SF\} network, deliberate vertex attacks can result in larger cascading failures than deliberate edge attacks; however, in the \{SW\} network the situation is opposite.

We detected the communities in the oil trade networks and analyzed their evolutionary properties and stabilities over time. We found that the unweighted and weighted international oil trade networks show many different features in terms of community number, community scale, distribution of countries, quality of partitions, and stability of communities. Two turning points occurred in the evolution of community stability in the international oil trade network. One is the year 2004–2005 which correlates with changes in demand and supply in the world oil market after the Iraq War, and the other is the year 2008–2009 which is connected to the 2008 financial crisis. Different causations of instability show different features and this should be considered by policy makers. }}

Human behavior such as contact precautions and social distancing clearly influence disease prevalence, but disease prevalence can in turn alter human behavior, forming a coupled, nonlinear system. Moreover, in many cases, the spatial structure of the population cannot be ignored, such that social and behavioral processes and/or transmission of infection must be represented with complex networks. Research on studying coupled disease–behavior dynamics in complex networks in particular is growing rapidly, and frequently makes use of analysis methods and concepts from statistical physics. Here, we review some of the growing literature in this area. We contrast network-based approaches to homogeneous-mixing approaches, point out how their predictions differ, and describe the rich and often surprising behavior of disease–behavior dynamics on complex networks, and compare them to processes in statistical physics. We discuss how these models can capture the dynamics that characterize many real-world scenarios, thereby suggesting ways that policy makers can better design effective prevention strategies. We also describe the growing sources of digital data that are facilitating research in this area. Finally, we suggest pitfalls which might be faced by researchers in the field, and we suggest several ways in which the field could move forward in the coming years. }}

And then, the \{BN\} parameters are learnt by using the cases which are designed from the seismic data in the period between 00:00:00 on January 1, 1992 and 00:00:00 on January 1, 2012. At last, predictions are done for the data in the period between 00:00:00 on January 1, 2012 and 00:00:00 on January 1, 2015 combining the \{BN\} with the parameters. The results show that the success rate of the prediction including delayed prediction is about 65%. It is also discovered that the predictions for some nodes have high rate of accuracy under investigation. }}

A new version of the adaptive control strategy is proposed to adjust control parameters to compensate for the adverse impact of network attenuation faults, nonlinearities and sampling errors. Based on the adaptive adjustment laws, an approach that is application of knowledge of electricity is introduced to physically realize the adaptive controllers. Using Lyapunov stability theory for the synchronization error system, asymptotic synchronization of the overall networks can be established for the nonlinearly sampling and faulty couplings. Finally, the proposed adaptive control schemes are tested by simulation on Chua׳s circuit network. }}

Here we discuss the complex network of signaling pathways occurring during PTI, focusing on the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases. }}

In the proposed algorithm, two measures are proposed to determine whether to add a node to a community and whether to merge two communities to form a new community. The proposed algorithm can automatically discover evolutionary community structure in weighted networks whose number of nodes and communities is changing over time and does not need to determine the number of communities in advance. The algorithm is tested using a synthetic network and two real-word complex networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can discover evolutionary community structure in dynamic weighted networks effectively. }}

Here we show that investors can overcome this complexity and globally minimize risk in portfolio models for any given expected return, provided the margin requirement remains below a critical, empirically measurable value. In practice, for markets with centrally regulated margin requirements, a rational stabilization strategy would be keeping margins small enough. This result follows from ground states of the random field spin glass Ising model that can be calculated exactly through convex optimization when relative spin coupling is limited by the norm of the network’s Laplacian matrix. In that regime, this novel approach is robust to noise in empirical data and may be also broadly relevant to complex networks with frustrated interactions that are studied throughout scientific fields. }}

abstract = {AbstractObjective Etomidate mimics some typical epileptic neurophysiological features, such as the appearance of spikes and high frequency oscillations, when it is administrated to epileptic patients. However, little is known about its influence on the underlying cortical network. An assessment of comparable cortical dynamics between seizures and etomidate would allow for a more detailed study of the network parameters underlying the ictal stage by using etomidate as a proxy. The objective of the present work is to show that temporal lobe seizures produce network changes comparable to the ones elicited by etomidate administration. Methods Scalp and foramen ovale electrodes (FOE) recordings from nine temporal lobe epilepsy patients were analyzed under the complex network perspective. The clustering coefficients, average path lengths, density of links, modularity and spectral entropy were calculated during the pre-ictal and ictal stages and post-etomidate administration. Etomidate administration produced no seizure in any of the analyzed cases. Results The density of lines (six of nine patients) and spectral entropy (eight of nine patients) displayed similar behavior to the preictal–ictal transition when etomidate effects altered the epileptic network (FOE + scalp). When considering only the mesial sub-network, changes induced by etomidate perfusion replicated the same type of imbalance observed during the ictal stage in the nine patient’s sample and in eight out of nine regarding the preictal stage. Both statistical significance at a level of 1% and size effects, evaluated by using the standardized mean differences, show similar network changes during the preictal–ictal and preictal–etomidate transitions. Conclusions Etomidate perfusion in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy induces network changes comparable to the changes resulting from seizures. Significance The finding reported here could improve the study of network dynamics during the ictal phase, not only with electrophysiological methods, but also in other cases, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. }}

Finding out the explanations behind the phenomena that networked systems can still function efficiently after some structural damages or the malfunction of certain nodes is meaningful to both the design of solid systems and the defend against failures. It is still indistinct what kind of resilience networked systems which change their topological structures incessantly over time might have. Nevertheless, earlier studies have frequently overlooked to consider the temporal characteristics which in many real scenarios are of great concern, or have considered only the temporality without spatiality which is not reasonable in the real world case. In this paper, we first take the spatiality of connections and communications between nodes, except for the temporal ordering of connection events which has solely been noticed by previous studies, into consideration for measuring and assessing the robustness of the temporal network. We propose a novel temporal efficiency metric, and correspondingly, develop a new temporal robustness evaluation method for temporal network models. The proposed metric and method show their validity through numerical simulations of three temporal network models and we give our evaluations and discussions. }}

We then focus on pinning-based consensus and flocking control of mobile multi-agent networked systems. One of the main challenges with consensus and flocking control is that the topology of the corresponding dynamical network is time-varying, which depends on the states of all the agents in the network. Looking forward to the next decade, we expect to have a much deeper understanding of the relationship between the effectiveness of pinning control and the structural properties of a complex network, which may result in better control of large scale networked systems. }}

Local metric like degree centrality is simple but less effective. Global metrics such as betweenness and closeness centrality perform well in ranking nodes, but are of high computational complexity. Recently, to rank nodes effectively and efficiently, a semi-local centrality measure has been proposed as a tradeoff between local and global metrics. However, in semi-local centrality, only the number of the nearest and the next nearest neighbors of a node is taken into account, while the topological connections among the neighbors are neglected. In this paper, we propose a local structural centrality measure which considers both the number and the topological connections of the neighbors of a node. To evaluate the performance of our method, we use the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model to simulate the epidemic spreading process on both artificial and real networks. By measuring the rank correlation between the ranked list generated by simulation results and the ones generated by centrality measures, we show that our method can rank the spreading ability of nodes more accurately than centrality measures such as degree, k -shell, betweenness, closeness and local centrality. Further, we show that our method can better distinguish the spreading ability of nodes. }}

We observe that inflexible individuals are very effective in consensus achievement and also in the rate of ordering process in complex networks. Zealots make the magnetization of the system to vary exponentially with time. We obtain that on \{SF\} networks, increasing the zealots’ population, Z , exponentially increases the rate of consensus achievement. The time needed for the system to reach a desired magnetization, shows a power-law dependence on Z . As well, we obtain that the decay time of the order parameter shows a power-law dependence on Z . We also investigate the role of zealots’ degree on the rate of ordering process and finally, we analyze the effect of network’s randomness on the efficiency of zealots. Moving from a regular to a random network, the re-wiring probability P r w increases. We show that with increasing P r w , the efficiency of zealots for reducing the consensus achievement time increases. The rate of consensus is compared with the rate of ordering for different re-wiring probabilities of \{WS\} networks. }}

The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a controller that can synchronize the concentration of the mRNA and the protein of \{GRNs\} in finite time with probability. Based on the recent finite-time stability theorem of stochastic nonlinear systems, sufficient conditions are first established for ensuring the finite-time stochastic stability of synchronization error in probability. Then, the gain parameters of the controller are obtained by solving a linear matrix inequality and the robust finite-time synchronization is guaranteed for \{GRNs\} with uncertain parameters. Compared with the previous references, a continuous finite-time controller is designed to achieve the synchronization objective and a constructive method that may accelerate the convergence is discussed. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. }}

Instead they are organized around main functional units. Integration of the communities depends on the assembly of the hydrophobic spine and phosphorylation of the activation loop. Single mutations can significantly disrupt the dynamic infrastructure and thereby interfere with long-distance allosteric signaling that propagates throughout the whole molecule. Dynamics is proposed to be the underlying mechanism for allosteric regulation in protein kinases. }}

The objective of our algorithm is to maximize a new structural robustness measure, natural connectivity, which provides a sensitive and reliable measure of the structural robustness of complex networks and has lower computation complexity. We initially applied this method to several networks with different degree distributions for contrast analysis and investigated the basic properties of the optimal network. We discovered that the optimal network based on the power-law degree distribution exhibits a roughly “eggplant-like” topology, where there is a cluster of high-degree nodes at the head and other low-degree nodes scattered across the body of “eggplant”. Additionally, the cost to rewire links in practical applications is considered; therefore, we optimized this method by employing the assortative rewiring strategy and validated its efficiency. }}

Specifically, assume that each node in the network contains an agent that, at a given period t , can be found in one of five states: sentiment neutrality, exuberant optimism, non-exuberant optimism, exuberant pessimism and non-exuberant pessimism. Local interaction rules, similar to those one encounters in rumor propagation models, make agents change their sentiment as they contact with others. Under a continuous-time framework, the proposed setting delivers a stable fixed-point equilibrium, meaning that the shares of agents in each sentiment category will converge to constant steady-state levels. The inspection of the same structure of analysis in discrete-time indicates that the stability outcome continues to hold when the connectivity degree is equal to 1. However, this result might change as one considers higher-order connectivity. In this last case, persistent endogenous waves of optimism and pessimism emerge under a reasonable parameterization of the model. }}

In this paper we address the interplay between the motifs’ cooperation properties and their abundance in a number of real-world networks including yeast protein–protein interaction, human brain, protein structure, email communication, dolphins’ social interaction, Zachary karate club and Net-science coauthorship networks. First, the amount of cooperativity for all possible undirected subgraphs with three to six nodes is calculated. To this end, the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisoner’s Dilemma game is considered and the cooperativity of each subgraph is calculated as the percentage of cooperating agents at the end of the simulation time. Then, the three- to six-node motifs are extracted for each network. The significance of the abundance of a motif, represented by a Z -value, is obtained by comparing them with some properly randomized versions of the original network. We found that there is always a group of motifs showing a significant inverse correlation between their cooperativity amount and Z -value, i.e. the more the Z -value the less the amount of cooperativity. This suggests that networks composed of well-structured units do not have good cooperativity properties. }}

The results indicate that the global oil export core network displays a scale-free behaviour, in which the trade position of nodes presents obvious heterogeneity and the ‘hub nodes’ play a ‘bridge’ role in the formation process of the trade network. The current global oil trade network can be divided into three trading blocs, including the ‘South America-West Africa-North America’ trading bloc, the ‘Middle East–Asian–Pacific region’ trading bloc, and ‘the former Soviet Union–North Africa–Europe’ trading bloc. Geopolitics and diplomatic relations are the two main reasons for this regional oil trade structure. Moreover, the global oil trade network presents a ‘robust but yet fragile’ characteristic, and the impacts of trade interruption always tend to spread throughout the whole network even if the occurrence of export disruptions is localised. }}

Both these aspects affect the propagation of the epidemic outbreak, for example the predicted outbreak sizes. Contact patterns can be represented at different levels of information content: as a temporal network (with temporal information about the contacts and who that is in contact with whom), as a static network (without information bout the time of the contacts) or as a fully connected system (where everyone can be in contact with everyone with equal chance all the time). We compare the predicted final outbreak sizes for these three contact-pattern representations, given the current state of the outbreak. We find that the temporal component has a strong influence on the diversity of outbreak sizes. }}

We simulate the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic process on synthetic scale-free networks and real-world networks by applying our rewiring algorithm. Experiments show that epidemics spread faster on networks with higher level of overlapping communities. Furthermore, overlapping communities’ effect interacts with the average degree’s effect.

Results To identify associations between diseases and protein complexes, we first constructed a protein complex network where two protein complexes are connected by shared genes.

A leave- one-out cross-validation method was used to assess the performance of the method. As a result, the performance in term of area under the \{ROC\} curve (AUC) was archived at a relative high value (&gt; 0.96).

A recent model, supported by neurophysiology, generates target selectivity by being sharply tuned to the unique spatiotemporal profile associated with target motion. Target neurons are likely connected in a complex network where some provide more direct output to behavior, whereas others serve an inter-regulatory role. These interactions may regulate attention and aid in the robust detection of targets in clutter observed in behavior. }}

We show that for a large class of dynamical systems and network topologies there is a critical coupling strength at which the systems undergo a transition from incoherent to coherent behavior. We find that the critical coupling strength at which this transition takes place is k c = ( Z λ ) − 1 , where Z depends only on the uncoupled dynamics of the individual systems on each node, while λ is the largest eigenvalue of the network adjacency matrix. Thus we achieve a separation of the problem into two parts, one depending solely on the node dynamics, and one depending solely on network topology. }}

Decision-makers generally rely either on historical data or intuitive prediction to gauge the rate of improvement and level of R&amp;D spending to achieve the desired improvement. This paper introduces a systematic way of forecasting the endogenous progress potential of a product based on the complexity of its knowledge structure. The knowledge structure represents knowledge associated with the product's core technology and the configuration of the components and sub-systems supporting the core technology. Topological properties of complex networks are applied to assess the knowledge complexity of a product relative to its class. Analyses of the complexity of knowledge structures for a set of energy harvesting devices confirm that node degree and clustering coefficient provide distinguishing topological properties whereas community size and membership number do not clearly differentiate the knowledge structure complexity. We discuss the implications of these findings on forecasting progress potential. }}

We also show how oriented spanning trees can be used to explicitly and systematically construct optimal networks under network topological constraints.

The results of the extensive simulation work on standard complex network models show that, except in a case that does not seem to be common in social networks, taking the tie strength into account does not change in a radical manner the long-run steady-state behavior of the studied games. Besides model networks, we also included a real-life case drawn from a coauthorship network. In this case also, taking the weights into account only changes the results slightly with respect to the raw unweighted graph, although to draw more reliable conclusions on real social networks many more cases should be studied as these weighted networks become available. }}

The community structure of complex networks reveals both their organization and hidden relations among their constituents. Most of the researches in the field of community detection mainly focus on the topological structure of the network without performing any content analysis. In recent years, a number of researches have proposed approaches which consider both the contents that are interchanged in networks, and the topological structures of the networks in order to find more meaningful communities. In this research, the effect of topic analysis in finding more meaningful communities in social networking sites in which the users express their feelings toward different objects (like movies) by means of rating is demonstrated by performing extensive experiments. }}

In detail, by using the impulsive signals from agents and virtual leaders, several impulsive control protocols are designed for reaching the second-order consensus of multi-agent systems with fixed or switching topologies. The theoretical analysis is also given to guarantee the second-order consensus based on algebraic graph theory and stability theory of impulsive differential equations. Finally, two typical examples are used to validate the above developed theoretical results. }}

The derived stability condition indicates that the smallest real part of eigenvalues of the Laplacian sub-matrix corresponding to the unpinned vertices can be used to measure the stabilizability of a digraph with a given pinned vertex set. A pinned vertex set can stabilize a directed network to some unstable trajectories, for instance, to a chaotic trajectory of the uncoupled systems, if and only if the pinned vertex set can access all other vertices in the digraph. Furthermore, in the bigraph case, the analytical estimation of the stabilizability’s lower bound suggests that an optimal pinning strategy should take not only the vertex degree, but also the shortest path between pairs of vertices into considerations. }}

By a series of simulations, we show that the structural properties of complex networks, such as the clustering coefficient and degree correlation, have a major influence on the dynamics of the market. We find that the network effect is increased if the interaction pattern of agents is characterized by a high clustering coefficient, or a positive degree correlation.

In this paper, the dynamic road risk for pedestrian evacuation in a densely populated area of Beijing was studied with consideration of different influencing factors. Firstly, the eight influencing factors including road width, node degree, safety betweenness, road resistor coefficient, building threat, pedestrian counterflow, illegal vehicle parking and traffic flow were considered to assess the road risk for pedestrian evacuation. Secondly, based on complex network theory, electric circuit theory and real situation of the roads, the comprehensive assessment function for road risk was developed quantitatively based on the eight influencing factors. Thirdly, we analyzed road risk for pedestrian evacuation considering different situations: current condition, regular condition, and optimal condition; the risk distribution maps were drawn to directly show the risk level. Through assessments, the roads with high risk for pedestrian evacuation were found, and an optimized evacuation plan was obtained and analyzed. This mathematical model can guide the emergency evacuation in real time. The process and the results are essential for improving the efficiency of evacuations which should considerably reduce the possibility of injuries, deaths and other losses in the disaster. }}

The algorithm is illustrated and compared with spectral clustering and \{NMF\} by using artificial examples and other classic real world networks. Experimental results show the significance of the proposed approach, particularly, in the cases when community structure is obscure. }}

Secure electrical power supply requires, together with careful operation, a robust design of the electrical power grid topology. Currently, the impact of the topology on grid robustness is mainly assessed by purely topological approaches, that fail to capture the essence of electric power flow. This paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, to relate the topology of a power grid to its robustness against cascading failures by deliberate attacks, while also taking the fundamental characteristics of the electric power grid into account such as power flow allocation according to Kirchhoff laws. Experimental verification on synthetic power systems shows that the proposed metric reflects the grid robustness accurately. The proposed metric is used to optimize a grid topology for a higher level of robustness. To demonstrate its applicability, the metric is applied on the \{IEEE\} 118 bus power system to improve its robustness against cascading failures. }}

The most successful approach to describe how coherent behavior emerges in these complex systems is given by the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. This model has been traditionally studied in complete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, complex systems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as complex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the field of synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we provide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global dynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which encompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis of several numerical results. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments on variations of the Kuramoto model in networks, including the presence of noise and inertia. The rich potential for applications is discussed for special fields in engineering, neuroscience, physics and Earth science. Finally, we conclude by discussing problems that remain open after the last decade of intensive research on the Kuramoto model and point out some promising directions for future research. }}

This coupled system is an important motif in complex networks. Thus, our study is a basic step for understanding structure formation in large networks. We use the Morris–Lecar neuron with class I and class \{II\} excitabilities as a node. Homogeneous (coupling the same class neurons) and heterogeneous (coupling different class neurons) cases are considered for both excitatory and inhibitory coupling. For the homogeneous system class \{II\} neurons are suitable for achieving both complete and cluster synchronization in excitatory and inhibitory coupling, respectively. For the heterogeneous system with inhibitory coupling, the class I hub neuron has a wider parameter region of synchronous firings than the class \{II\} hub. Moreover, the class I hub neuron with the excitatory synapse gives rise to bifurcations of synchronized states and multi-stability (coexistence of a few different states) is observed. }}

abstract = {Abstract Evolutionary foodweb models are used to build food webs by the repeated addition of new species. Population dynamics leads to the extinction or establishment of a newly added species, and possibly to the extinction of other species. The food web structure that emerges after some time is a highly nontrivial result of the evolutionary and dynamical rules. We investigate the evolutionary food web model introduced by Loeuille and Loreau (2005), which characterizes species by their body mass as the only evolving trait. Our goal is to find the reasons behind the model's remarkable robustness and its capability to generate various and stable networks. In contrast to other evolutionary food web models, this model requires neither adaptive foraging nor allometric scaling of metabolic rates with body mass in order to produce complex networks that do not eventually collapse to trivial structures. Our study shows that this is essentially due to the fact that the difference in niche value between predator and prey as well as the feeding range are constrained so that they remain within narrow limits under evolution. Furthermore, competition between similar species is sufficiently strong, so that a trophic level can accommodate several species. We discuss the implications of these findings and argue that the conditions that stabilize other evolutionary food web models have similar effects because they also prevent the occurrence of extreme specialists or extreme generalists that have in general a higher fitness than species with a moderate niche width. }}

In this work, a method is proposed to map complex networks of \{AIDS\} prevalence in the \{US\} counties, incorporating information about the chemical structure, molecular target, organism, and results in preclinical protocols of assay for all drugs in the cocktail. Different machine learning methods were trained and validated to select the best model. The Shannon information invariants of molecular graphs for drugs, and social networks of income inequality were used as input. The nodes in molecular graphs represent atoms weighed by Pauling electronegativity values, and the links correspond to the chemical bonds. On the other hand, the nodes in the social network represent the \{US\} counties and have Gini coefficients as weights. We obtained the data about anti-HIV drugs from the ChEMBL database and the data about \{AIDS\} prevalence and Gini coefficient from the \{AIDSVu\} database of Emory University. Box–Jenkins operators were used to measure the shift with respect to average behavior of drugs from reference compounds assayed with/in a given protocol, target, or organism. To train/validate the model and predict the complex network, we needed to analyze 152,628 data points including values of \{AIDS\} prevalence in 2310 counties in the \{US\} vs. ChEMBL results for 21,582 unique drugs, 9 viral or human protein targets, 4856 protocols, and 10 possible experimental measures. The best model found was a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity above 0.80 in training and external validation series. }}

To contend with the issue, the paper mainly considers easily obtained inflow and outflow of a link and road capacity as input, and proposes a route guidance strategy for a single destination road network based on the determination of free-flow or congested conditions on alternative routes. An extended strategy for a complex network and a feedback approximation for avoiding forecast are further explored. Weaknesses of the strategy are also explicitly analyzed. To test the strategy, simulation investigations are conducted on two networks with multiple parallel routes. The results indicate that the strategy is able to provide stable splitting rates and to approximate user optimal equilibrium in different conditions, in particular when traffic demand is high. This strategy has potential to be applied in an urban road network due to its simplicity and easily obtained input data. The strategy is also applicable for single destination if some alternatives and similar routes are available. }}

We suggest that one way forward for analysis of brain networks will be to quantify aspects of their organization which are likely to be generic properties of a broader class of biological systems. In this introductory review article we will highlight four important aspects of complex systems in general: fractality or scale-invariance; criticality; small-world and related topological attributes; and modularity. For each concept we will provide an accessible introduction, an illustrative data-based example of how it can be used to investigate aspects of brain organization in neuroimaging experiments, and a brief review of how this concept has been applied and developed in other fields of biomedical and physical science. The aim is to provide a didactic, focussed and user-friendly introduction to the concepts of complexity science for neuroscientists and neuroimagers. }}

This value completely determines the dynamics of the model and interestingly, the threshold is not dependent on the functional form of the nonlinear incidence rate. Furthermore, if the transmission rate is less than or equal to the threshold value, the disease will die out. Otherwise, it will be permanent. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate the theoretical results. We also consider the effect of the nonlinear incidence on the epidemic dynamics. }}

The analysis of αreverse and \{RKD\} processes shows information diffusion irreversibility in small-world and scale-free but not in random networks. It also shows that random networks are more stable toward attacks, resulting a complete information diffusion process over the entire network. Finally, a real Complex network example, represented as a “virtual friendship network” was analyzed and found to share properties of both random and small-world networks. Therefore, it is characterized to be somewhere between random and small-world network models or in other words, it is a randomized small-world network model. }}

The robustness of a power grid does not always increase monotonically with the capacity. This property is different from the results obtained in previous studies, which have indicated that the robustness increases monotonically with capacity. To understand the non-monotonic phenomenon, the cascading failure is divided into several sub-stages, and we analyze the number of overloaded nodes and the average remaining load in each sub-stage. The results indicate that the increasing capacity is barely able to reduce the number of overloaded nodes at the beginning of malfunction, which may lead to more nodes being removed subsequently, including certain nodes with many connections or large load. More loads remain in the power grid such that certain nodes cannot take the load. This eventually causes overloading of more nodes and a decline in the robustness of the power grid. The conclusion may be useful for power grid planners seeking to design grids with cost-effective capacity. }}

When a zooming out strategy is applied new matrix functions are introduced, which give a more global picture of the topological surrounds of a node. These indices permit a modulation of the scales at which the environment of a node influences its centrality. We apply them to the study of 10 protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. We illustrate the similarities and differences between the generalized subgraph centrality indices as well as among them and some classical centrality measures. We show here that the use of centrality indices based on the zooming in strategy identifies a larger number of essential proteins in the yeast \{PPI\} network than any of the other centrality measures studied. }}

The improvements are three-fold: (1) in the optimization problem formulation, we introduce a third objective function to minimize the impacts of the switching off operations onto the existing network topology; (2) in the optimization problem formulation, we use the final results of cascades, rather than only a short horizon of one step cascading, to evaluate the effects of the switching off strategies; (3) in the optimization algorithm, the fast non-dominated sorting mechanisms are incorporated into the \{MBDE\} algorithm: a new algorithm, namely non-dominated sorting binary differential evolution algorithm (NSBDE) is then proposed. The numerical application to the topological structure of the 380 kV Italian power transmission network proves the benefits of the improvements. }}

The presented pressure traces show regular and occasional pressure transient waves in various complex networks. Histogram analysis of the rate of change of head provides some insight into transient behaviour in these sites. Although there was no distinct correlation between network characteristics (ie. length, diameter, age) and transient behaviour, network complexity was observed to change the transient characteristics. Transient characteristics were observed to be strongly influenced by likely sources, in particular commercial customers. The data highlights the need to understand, quantify and characterise transients and hence link to possible impacts, such as structural or water quality failures. }}

In this paper, the simulated annealing strategy is used to maximize the modularity of a network, associating with a dissimilarity-index-based and with a diffusion-distance-based k -means iterative procedure. The proposed algorithms outperform most existing methods in the literature as regards the optimal modularity found. They can not only identify the community structure, but also give the central node of each community during the cooling process. An appropriate number of communities can be efficiently determined without any prior knowledge about the community structure. The computational results for several artificial and real-world networks confirm the capability of the algorithms. }}

In this paper, we explore the statistical properties of Chinese language networks (CLNs) within the framework of complex network theory. Based on one of the largest Chinese corpora, i.e. People’s Daily Corpus, we construct two networks (CLN1 and CLN2) from two different respects, with Chinese words as nodes. In CLN1, a link between two nodes exists if they appear next to each other in at least one sentence; in CLN2, a link represents that two nodes appear simultaneously in a sentence. We show that both networks exhibit small-world effect, scale-free structure, hierarchical organization and disassortative mixing. These results indicate that in many topological aspects Chinese language shapes complex networks with organizing principles similar to other previously studied language systems, which shows that different languages may have some common characteristics in their evolution processes. We believe that our research may shed some new light into the Chinese language and find some potentially significant implications. }}

In this paper, we have demonstrated the occurrence of multi-stable states in a system of identical phase oscillators that are dynamically coupled. We find that the multi-stable state is comprised of a two cluster synchronization state where the clusters are in anti-phase relationship with each other and a desynchronization state. We also find that the phase relationship between the oscillators is asymptotically stable irrespective of whether there is synchronization or desynchronization in the system. The time scale of the coupling affects the size of the clusters in the two cluster state. We also investigate the effect of both the coupling asymmetry and plasticity asymmetry on the multi-stable states. In the absence of coupling asymmetry, increasing the plasticity asymmetry causes the system to go from a two clustered state to a desynchronization state and then to a two clustered state. Further, the coupling asymmetry, if present, also affects this transition. We also analytically find the occurrence of the above mentioned multi-stable–desynchronization–multi-stable state transition. A brief discussion on the phase evolution of nonidentical oscillators is also provided. Our analytical results are in good agreement with our numerical observations. }}

Using ROV, we construct a source estimator for tree graph and generalize it to arbitrary graph. Based on the generalized estimator, a novel Propagation Centrality (PC) algorithm is proposed, which could locate the propagation source on arbitrary graph with complexity O(N3). With \{PC\} algorithm, source location is converted into finding out a Breadth-First-Search (BFS) spanning tree with the maximal \{ROV\} from infected graph.

However, if the network consists of large numbers of genes and interactions, the oscillation generator is deeply hidden in the complicated interactions. We apply the dominant phase-advanced driving path method proposed in Qian et al. (2010) [1] to reduce complex genomic regulatory networks to one-dimensional and unidirectionally linked network graphs where negative regulatory loops are explored to play as the central generators of the oscillations, and oscillation propagation pathways in the complex networks are clearly shown by tree branches radiating from the loops.

Signature-based approaches for identifying data types are easily fooled and analysts can only investigate a small fraction of network events. However, neural networks can learn to identify subtle patterns in a suitably chosen input space. To this end, we have developed a signal processing approach for classifying data files which readily adapts to new data formats. We evaluate the performance for three input spaces consisting of the power spectral density, byte probability distribution and sliding-window entropy of the byte sequence in a file. By combining all three, we trained a deep neural network to discriminate amongst nine common data types found on the Internet with 97.4% accuracy. }}

Characteristic collaboration patterns were identified for each researcher, and their analysis revealed that larger affine groups tend to be less stable. }}

We show that this combinatorial optimization method, together with the information contained in the Laplacian spectrum, allows an exact reconstruction of small networks and leads to good approximations in the case of networks with larger orders. We also show that the method can be used to generate a quasi-optimal topology for a network associated to a dynamic process (like in the case of metabolic or protein–protein interaction networks of organisms). }}

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that is able to detect overlapping and non-overlapping community structures in complex networks. This algorithm uses a number of agents for investigation of the input network. These agents consider different nodes’ closeness in their investigations. Various experiments are carried out on both synthetic and real-world networks that prove that the proposed algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art algorithms of this field both in terms of the accuracy and execution time. }}

To make a real-world complex network controllable with its desired topology, the study on network controllability has been one of the most critical and attractive subjects for both network and control communities. In this paper, based on a given directed–weighted network with both state and control nodes, a novel optimization tool with extremal dynamics to generate an optimal network topology with minimum control nodes and complete controllability under Kalman’s rank condition has been developed. The experimental results on a number of popular benchmark networks show the proposed tool is effective to identify the minimum control nodes which are sufficient to guide the whole network’s dynamics and provide the evolution of network topology during the optimization process. We also find the conclusion: “the sparse networks need more control nodes than the dense, and the homogeneous networks need fewer control nodes compared to the heterogeneous” (Liu et al., 2011  [18]), is also applicable to network complete controllability. These findings help us to understand the network dynamics and make a real-world network under the desired control. Moreover, compared with the relevant research results on structural controllability with minimum driver nodes, the proposed solution methodology may also be applied to other constrained network optimization problems beyond complete controllability with minimum control nodes. }}

Both impulsive and continuous parts of the fuzzy model have different multiple time-varying delays, which make the considered model general and practical. A novel lemma on exponential stability of impulsive delayed differential equations was established, in which the impulsive functions exhibit multiple time-varying delays. By utilizing the proposed lemma, Lyapunov functions, the stochastic analysis techniques, and the Kronecker product, general criteria ensuring global exponential synchronization in mean square of the addressed \{TS\} fuzzy complex networks are obtained. Moreover, the theory of function minimum value is utilized to reduce the conservativeness of the obtained synchronization criteria, which also makes them simple and easy to be verified in practical applications. Results of this paper improve and extend some existing ones. Numerical simulations including small-world network coupled with time-delayed Lorenz system are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results. }}

Meanwhile a bi-scale method is proposed to combine the information of microscale (neighbors) and mesoscale (communities) in the observed networks.

abstract = {Abstract The electric power grid is a critical infrastructure that delivers electricity from power generation sources to consumers. At this time, renewable and distributed sources of electricity as well as new technologies that introduce large loads are significantly changing load profiles in low-voltage grids. This trend calls for reassessing the structure of low-voltage grids to examine if they can safely accommodate the new load profiles. The future smart grid will also rely on information and communications networks to support decentralized power distribution. The information and communications network nodes may depend on the grid for power supply, leading to bidirectional interdependence between the two types of networks that could affect the reliability of the power grid. This paper focuses on the problem of enhancing the reliability of future low-voltage grids by improving their structure and dealing with their interdependence with information and communications networks. The paper investigates the structural features of a low-voltage grid and assesses their influence on the ability of the grid to handle new load profiles. Concepts from complex networks theory are used to derive relevant structural metrics that characterize the structural properties of low-voltage grids and performance metrics are proposed to assess their operational performance. Several low-voltage networks are analyzed under various loading scenarios to observe the influence of structural metrics of a low-voltage grid on its operational metrics. Based on this analysis, a constraint programming formulation is proposed for the cost-optimal and robust structural design of a low-voltage grid. In addition, a design algorithm is proposed that considers the interdependence of information and communications network nodes on power grid nodes to increase the reliability of the grid. }}

abstract = {Abstract In the context of dynamical systems, time series analysis is frequently used to identify the underlying nature of a phenomenon of interest from a sequence of observations. For signals with a self-affine structure, like fractional Brownian motions (fBm), the Hurst exponent H is one of the key parameters. Here, the use of quantile graphs (QGs) for the estimation of H is proposed. A \{QG\} is generated by mapping the quantiles of a time series into nodes of a graph. H is then computed directly as the power-law scaling exponent of the mean jump length performed by a random walker on the QG, for different time differences between the time series data points. The \{QG\} method for estimating the Hurst exponent was applied to fBm with different H values. Comparison with the exact H values used to generate the motions showed an excellent agreement. For a given time series length, estimation error depends basically on the statistical framework used for determining the exponent of the power-law model. The \{QG\} method is numerically simple and has only one free parameter, Q , the number of quantiles/nodes. With a simple modification, it can be extended to the analysis of fractional Gaussian noises. }}

By receiving the network nodes evolution, the topology of such a kind of network with identical or different nodes, or even with varying topology can be monitored. In comparison with previous methods, time delay is taken into account in this simple, analytical and systematic synchronization-based technique. Particularly, the weight configuration matrix is not necessarily symmetric or irreducible, and the inner-coupling matrix need not be symmetric. Illustrative simulations are provided to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. }}

This in turn motivates our research in developing two new network growth models in which a new node is connected to an old node with the probability that depends not only on the degree but also on the “age” of the old node. Through computational and empirical studies, we demonstrate that our models have better explanatory power than the existing ones.

It is of theoretical interest and practical significance in modern science. So far, a large number of algorithms have been proposed to detect community structures in complex networks, but most of them are suitable for a specific network structure. In this paper, a novel method (called CDMIC) is proposed to detect the communities in un-weighted, weighted, un-directed, directed and signed networks by constructing a dissimilarity distance matrix of network and identifying community centers with maximizing modularity. For a given network, we first estimate the distance between all pairs of nodes for constructing the dissimilarity distance matrix of the network. Then, this distance matrix is input to the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm to extract a candidate center set of community. Thirdly, we rank these centers in descending order according to the sum of their availability and responsibility. Finally, we determine the community structure by selecting the center subset from the candidate center set in an incremental manner to make the modularity maximization. On three real-world networks and some synthetic networks, experimental results show that our \{CDMIC\} method has higher performance in terms of classification accuracy and normalized mutual information (NMI), and ability to tolerate the resolution limitation. }}

Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic continues to grow in an exponential form and has evident seasonal fluctuations. We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities. }}

The initial generation of generators and the initial loads of substations are calculated according to the path efficiency and the load of the consumers. If a node fails, it is removed from the power grid, and all paths passing through it will fail to transfer power. In that case, the loads of the corresponding consumers are redistributed within the whole network. During the failure cascading and propagation procedure, our node removal rule is to remove the first overload node along the opposite direction of power flow, then the network distributes load and goes on the cascade procedure. Our new removal rule for nodes does suppress the large scale cascading failures. This work would be very helpful for designing the protective relay system and the tolerant parameters of the grid. }}

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy community detection method that iteratively propagates membership-degrees of all vertices. In each iteration, a candidate seed vertex of a potential community is first selected according to the topological characteristics. After that, the membership-degrees are propagated among adjacent vertices so that a number of communities can be obtained with respect to all selected seeds. To ensure that the modularity keeps improving, in each iteration we discard the selected seeds that decreases the modularity of the community decomposition. In this manner, the topological information about the network can be fully utilized, and communities gradually emerge along with the acceptance of new seeds. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that our approach has impressive performance and is robust on both disjoint and fuzzy community detections. Moreover, the proposed approach exhibits a high flexibility between computational complexity and overall performance. }}

We show that the conserved CUP-homology domain (CHD) of human 4E-T interacts directly with \{DDX6\} in both the presence and absence of the central \{MIF4G\} domain of CNOT1. The 2.1-Å resolution structure of the corresponding ternary complex reveals how 4E-T \{CHD\} wraps around the RecA2 domain of \{DDX6\} and contacts CNOT1. Although 4E-T \{CHD\} lacks recognizable sequence similarity with Edc3 or Pat1, it shares the same DDX6-binding surface. In contrast to 4E-T, however, the Edc3 and Pat1 \{FDF\} motifs dissociate from \{DDX6\} upon \{CNOT1\} \{MIF4G\} binding in vitro. The results underscore the presence of a complex network of simultaneous and/or mutually exclusive interactions in DDX6-mediated repression. }}

abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we aim at estimating the state of an ensemble of mobile agents. Specifically, each agent is an oscillator which moves along a circle at a given time-varying angular velocity. We assume that an agent can measure the distance from the other oscillators only when they are in its proximity. We propose a recursive algorithm which, based on these intermittent and uncertain measurements, is capable of estimating in real-time the relative angular position of the agents. The algorithm combines the information coming from the collected measures with the information on the agents’ dynamics, and its convergence is proved by means of interval analysis. The theoretical analysis is complemented with extensive numerical simulations. }}

The atomic interactions within the network provide the structural support for this ‘signaling highway’. Network descriptors, capturing network signaling efficiency, explain allostery in terms of signal transmission. In this review we will survey the key applications of graph theory to protein allostery. The complex network approach introduces a new perspective in biochemistry; as for applications, the development of new drugs relying on allosteric effects (allo-network drugs) represents a promising avenue of contact network formalism. }}

In this paper, an agent-based model is established to quantitatively analyze the impacts of suppressing guides on information spreading. We find that the spreading threshold depends on the attractiveness of the information and the topology of the social network with no suppressing guides at all. Usually, one would expect that the existence of suppressing guides in the spreading procedure may result in less diffusion of information within the overall network. However, we find that sometimes the opposite is true: the manipulating nodes of suppressing guides may lead to more extensive information spreading when there are audiences with the reversal mind. These results can provide valuable theoretical references to public opinion guidance on various information, e.g., rumor or news spreading. }}

This predicts that C becomes about 3/4, when K is sufficiently large. However, we find that this is not satisfied when K is large, because of the periodic boundary condition of the ring lattice. We further investigate how the change in C of the ring lattice affects behavior of coupled dynamical systems on the ring lattice. }}

abstract = {Abstract Graph theory has long been used in quantitative geography and landscape ecology and has been applied in Earth and atmospheric sciences for several decades. Recently, however, there have been increased, and more sophisticated, applications of graph theory concepts and methods in geosciences, principally in three areas: spatially explicit modeling, small-world networks, and structural models of Earth surface systems. This paper reviews the contrasting goals and methods inherent in these approaches, but focuses on the common elements, to develop a synthetic view of graph theory in the geosciences. Techniques applied in geosciences are mainly of three types: connectivity measures of entire networks; metrics of various aspects of the importance or influence of particular nodes, links, or regions of the network; and indicators of system dynamics based on graph adjacency matrices. Geoscience applications of graph theory can be grouped in five general categories: (1) Quantification of complex network properties such as connectivity, centrality, and clustering; (2) Tests for evidence of particular types of structures that have implications for system behavior, such as small-world or scale-free networks; (3) Testing dynamical system properties, e.g., complexity, coherence, stability, synchronization, and vulnerability; (4) Identification of dynamics from historical records or time series; and (5) spatial analysis. Recent and future expansion of graph theory in geosciences is related to general growth of network-based approaches. However, several factors make graph theory especially well suited to the geosciences: Inherent complexity, exploration of very large data sets, focus on spatial fluxes and interactions, and increasing attention to state transitions are all amenable to analysis using graph theory approaches. }}

Methods Seventy-nine patients with either abnormal sputum cytology or lung cancer were entered into the study. First, high-resolution bronchovideoscopy with white light was performed. Observations were repeated using \{NBI\} light to examine microvascular structures in the bronchial mucosa. Spectral features of the \{RGB\} (red/green/blue) sequential videoscope system were changed from a conventional \{RGB\} filter to the new \{NBI\} filter. The wavelength ranges of the \{NBI\} filter were: 400–430 nm (blue), 400–430 nm (green) and 520–560 nm (red). Results The following were clearly observed with \{NBI\} with high-resolution bronchovideoscopy: increased vessel growth and complex networks of tortuous vessels of various sizes, in squamous dysplasia; some dotted vessels, in addition to increased vessel growth and complex networks of tortuous vessels, in ASD; several dotted vessels and spiral or screw type tumor vessels of various sizes and grades, in SCC. Capillary blood vessel and/or tumor vessel mean diameters of ASD, CIS, microinvasive and invasive carcinoma were 41.4 ± 9.8 μm, 63.7 ± 8.2 μm, 136.5 ± 29.9 μm and 259.4 ± 29.6 μm, respectively. These results indicated a statistically significant increase of mean vessel diameters in the four groups (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion \{NBI\} with high-resolution bronchovideoscopy was useful for detecting the increased vessel growth and complex networks of tortuous vessels, dotted vessels and spiral or screw type tumor vessels of bronchial mucosa. This may enable detecting the onset of angiogenesis during multi-step carcinogenesis of the lung. }}

abstract = {Graph and Complex Network theory is expanding its application to different levels of matter organization such as molecular, biological, technological, and social networks. A network is a set of items, usually called nodes, with connections between them, which are called links or edges. There are many different experimental and/or theoretical methods to assign node–node links depending on the type of network we want to construct. Unfortunately, the use of a method for experimental reevaluation of the entire network is very expensive in terms of time and resources; thus the development of cheaper theoretical methods is of major importance. In addition, different methods to link nodes in the same type of network are not totally accurate in such a way that they do not always coincide. In this sense, the development of computational methods useful to evaluate connectivity quality in complex networks (a posteriori of network assemble) is a goal of major interest. In this work, we report for the first time a new method to calculate numerical quality scores S(Lij) for network links Lij (connectivity) based on the Markov–Shannon Entropy indices of order k-th (θk) for network nodes. The algorithm may be summarized as follows: (i) first, the θk(j) values are calculated for all j-th nodes in a complex network already constructed; (ii) A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to seek a linear equation that discriminates connected or linked (Lij=1) pairs of nodes experimentally confirmed from non-linked ones (Lij=0); (iii) the new model is validated with external series of pairs of nodes; (iv) the equation obtained is used to re-evaluate the connectivity quality of the network, connecting/disconnecting nodes based on the quality scores calculated with the new connectivity function. This method was used to study different types of large networks. The linear models obtained produced the following results in terms of overall accuracy for network reconstruction: Metabolic networks (72.3%), Parasite–Host networks (93.3%), CoCoMac brain cortex co-activation network (89.6%), \{NW\} Spain fasciolosis spreading network (97.2%), Spanish financial law network (89.9%) and World trade network for Intelligent &amp; Active Food Packaging (92.8%). In order to seek these models, we studied an average of 55,388 pairs of nodes in each model and a total of 332,326 pairs of nodes in all models. Finally, this method was used to solve a more complicated problem. A model was developed to score the connectivity quality in the Drug–Target network of \{US\} \{FDA\} approved drugs. In this last model the θk values were calculated for three types of molecular networks representing different levels of organization: drug molecular graphs (atom–atom bonds), protein residue networks (amino acid interactions), and drug–target network (compound–protein binding). The overall accuracy of this model was 76.3%. This work opens a new door to the computational reevaluation of network connectivity quality (collation) for complex systems in molecular, biomedical, technological, and legal–social sciences as well as in world trade and industry. }}

abstract = {Abstract The last decade witnessed a great development of the structural and dynamic study of complex systems described as a network of elements. Therefore, systems can be described as a set of, possibly, heterogeneous entities or agents (the network nodes) interacting in, possibly, different ways (defining the network edges). In this context, it is of practical interest to model and handle not only static and homogeneous networks but also dynamic, heterogeneous ones. Depending on the size and type of the problem, these networks may require different computational approaches involving sequential, parallel or distributed systems with or without the use of disk-based data structures. In this work, we develop an Application Programming Interface (APINetworks) for the modeling and treatment of general networks in arbitrary computational environments. To minimize dependency between components, we decouple the network structure from its function using different packages for grouping sets of related tasks. The structural package, the one in charge of building and handling the network structure, is the core element of the system. In this work, we focus in this \{API\} structural component. We apply an object-oriented approach that makes use of inheritance and polymorphism. In this way, we can model static and dynamic networks with heterogeneous elements in the nodes and heterogeneous interactions in the edges. In addition, this approach permits a unified treatment of different computational environments. Tests performed on a C++11 version of the structural package show that, on current standard computers, the system can handle, in main memory, directed and undirected linear networks formed by tens of millions of nodes and edges. Our results compare favorably to those of existing tools.

Nature of problem: The computational modeling and handling of complex systems, described as a network of interacting elements, is nowadays a topic of paramount importance. In the general case, it is necessary to represent static or dynamic, time dependent, sets of heterogeneous entities related through heterogeneous interactions. In turn, and depending on the size and nature of the problem, different computational approaches may be required. Thus, we can resort to sequential, parallel or distributed systems and to disk-based data structures. Different tools are available that satisfy one or several of these requirements. However, a unified approach for dealing with heterogeneous networks in arbitrary computational environments is still pending. Solution method: To address the above issues, we have developed an Application Programming Interface: APINetworks. The \{API\} is organized in several packages where the one responsible for the network structure acts as the core element. We resort to an object-oriented approach, that makes use of inheritance and polymorphism. In this way, we can model static and dynamic networks and include heterogeneous agents in the nodes and heterogeneous interactions in the edges. In addition, this approach permits a unified treatment, transparent to the user, of different computational environments: sequential, parallel, distributed, memory-based or disk-based.

This analysis is further extended to the case where only a small fraction of coupling gains are choosen to be adjusted. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions and utilizing the proposed lemma, two sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the network synchronization by using the proposed adaptive laws. Finally, numerical examples are given to validate the theoretical results. }}

Furthermore, the stability of virus-free equilibria is analyzed via a threshold value associated with the topology of the Internet and the model parameters. It is established that, if the threshold value is less than or equal to the unity, the virus-free equilibria are alternatively globally attractive, resulting in virus eradication, while if the threshold value is greater than unity, the antivirus-independent virus equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, leading to virus diffusion, while the antivirus-dependent virus equilibrium also is globally asymptotically stable.

abstract = {Abstract The link prediction algorithm which based on node similarity is the research hotspot in recent years. In addition, there are some methods which based on the network community structure information to predict the missing links, however, these studies only concerned about the obvious information between different communities such as direct links. We found that it is hard to predict the missing links if the two communities have little direct connections. In fact, there is similarity between communities such as the similarity between nodes and this similarity is significant for prediction. So, we define a community similarity feature which named community relevance by using not only the obvious information but also the latent information between different communities in this paper. Then a novel algorithm which based on the community relevance and ruler inference is proposed to predict missing links. In this method, we extract the community structure by using the local information of the network first. Next, calculate the relevance of each pair of communities by using the new community relevance indices. Finally, a simple prediction model which based on ruler inference is applied to estimate the probability of the missing links. It is shown that the proposed method has more effective prediction accuracy and the community relevance features improve the predictor with low time complexity, with experiments on benchmark networks and real-world networks in different scales, and compared with other ten sate of the art approaches. }}

Proper modeling of spatially heterogeneous systems requires additional model features and added modeling scales, beyond those required for spatially homogenous systems. These different modeling scales are defined here as different layers in the hierarchical relationships in a network. For example, protein molecules and cells that contain the protein molecules belong to different scales. }}

This paper presents the results of a study using a simple model to investigate the impacts of basic architecture characteristics on the spread of failures through a system-of-system after an initial failure occurs. The study reported here uses a non-symmetric inter-grid only failure model to investigate the sensitivity of failure progression due to failure in dependent nodes in a system-of-system composed of dependent grid networks to the several basic parameters, including initial failure size, grid node density and grid interdependency radius. Despite the use of only an inter-grid failure mechanism, the study results generally showed a rapid failure propagation to a steady state condition. A possible mechanism for this return to steady state in terms of the expanding failure front and probability that existing dependent nodes lie outside of the failure front is discussed. }}

This result agree with the fact that many real world transportation networks naturally evolve to this kind of correlation. We explain our results showing that for the disassortative case the clusters in the gradient network turn out to be as much elongated as possible, reducing the pressure congestion J and observing the opposite behavior for the assortative case. Finally we apply our model to real world networks, and the results agree with our theoretical model. }}

Modularity optimisation is a widely accepted method for community detection. It has been shown that the modularity optimisation has a resolution limit because it is unable to detect communities with sizes smaller than a certain number of vertices defined with network size. In this paper we propose a metric for describing community structures that enables community detection better than other metrics. We present a fast local expansion algorithm for community detection. The proposed algorithm provides online multiresolution community detection from a source vertex. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in both real-world and synthetic networks. }}

In this paper, we consider two kinds of epidemic spreading models named SIR-DIAL model and SIR-NIAL model, and propose methods to solve the \{FAY\} problem based on the replica similarity during the epidemic process. To acquire high accuracy, our methods need to observe the spreading information of as many epidemics as possible, and record state information of nodes at as many time steps as possible during the epidemic spreading process with SIR-DIAL model; but just the final results after the epidemic spreading process ends in SIR-NIAL model. }}

This result could be very important for some technological applications. On the other hand, far from the optimal correlation, W s scales logarithmically with the system size. }}

Analyzing the clustering results with the average age and parent–children relationship of each cluster may be helpful in detecting emergence. In addition, topological measures, within-cluster degree z and participation coefficient P, succeeded in determining whether there are emerging knowledge clusters. There were at least two types of development of knowledge domains. One is incremental innovation as in GaN and the other is branching innovation as in complex networks. In the domains where incremental innovation occurs, papers changed their position to large z and large P. On the other hand, in the case of branching innovation, they moved to a position with large z and small P, because there is a new emerging cluster, and active research centers shift rapidly. Our results showed that topological measures are beneficial in detecting branching innovation in the citation network of scientific publications. }}

We calculated the phase synchrony index between each possible pairs of \{EEG\} channels in alpha and beta frequency bands and analyzed the local interconnectedness, overall connectedness and small-world characteristic of brain network in different degree for two groups. Relative to healthy normal controls, the properties of cortical networks in \{MCI\} patients tend to be a shift of randomization. Lower σ of \{MCI\} had suggested that patients had a further loss of small-world attribute both during active and resting states. Our results provide evidence for the functional disconnection of brain regions in MCI. Furthermore, we found the properties of cortical networks could reflect the processing of conflict information in the selective attention task. The human brain tends to be a more regular and efficient neural architecture in the late stage of information processing. In addition, the processing of conflict information needs stronger information integration and transfer between cortical areas. }}

abstract = {Abstract We investigate an ensemble of coupled model neurons, consisting of groups of varying sizes and intrinsic dynamics, ranging from periodic to chaotic, where the inter-group coupling interaction is effectively like a dynamic signal from a different sub-population. We observe that the minority group can significantly influence the majority group. For instance, when a small chaotic group is coupled to a large periodic group, the chaotic group de-synchronizes. However, counter-intuitively, when a small periodic group couples strongly to a large chaotic group, it leads to complete synchronization in the majority chaotic population, which also spikes at the frequency of the small periodic group. It then appears that the small group of periodic neurons can act like a pacemaker for the whole network. Further, we report the existence of varied clustering patterns, ranging from sets of synchronized clusters to anti-phase clusters, governed by the interplay of the relative sizes and dynamics of the sub-populations. So these results have relevance in understanding how a group can influence the synchrony of another group of dynamically different elements, reminiscent of event-related synchronization/de-synchronization in complex networks. }}

The switching parameters are generated from a continuous-time irreducible Markov chain taking value in a finite-state space. The purpose of the problem addressed is to derive a sufficient condition such that the dynamics of the neural network is almost surely exponentially stable. By generalized Itô׳s formula, strong law of large numbers for martingales and ergodicity of Markov chain, the stochastic analysis approach is developed to establish the desired condition which depends only on the stationary distribution of the Markov chain and some constants. Two numerical examples are given to verify the usefulness of the stability condition. }}

When all nodes are colored, nodes with the same color are sorted into an independent set. Then we choose the nodes at the top positions of the ranking list according to their centralities. The experimental results for an artificial network and three empirical networks show that, comparing with the performance of traditional coloring method, the improvement ratio of our distance-based coloring method could reach 12.82%, 8.16%, 4.45%, 2.93% for the ER, Erdős, Polblogs and Routers networks respectively. }}

In this study, neurons and microglial cells were treated with ultrasounds (commonly used in diagnostics) and differences in cell proliferation and morphology were evaluated in comparison to control, untreated cells. Cell proliferation was evaluated by standard viability assessment, while the quantitative analysis of cell morphology, usually performed by edge and line detection algorithms, required the development of a new special algorithm. In fact, traditional software methodologies do not provide the appropriate tools for morphological analysis of neurons and microglial cells, typically characterized by a roughly triangular body and numerous elongations of different lengths resulting in a complex neuron–microglia network. This new method, based on a modified Hough Transform algorithm using a matching operator instead of the common gradient filter, enabled the automatic identification of cell elongations and branches, the extraction of related information, and the comparison of the data between control and treated neurons, as well as microglial cells. Results, based on the development of the new algorithm, showed that in ultrasound-treated cells, the number of elongations, as well as their maximum and mean lengths, increased significantly in comparison to control, untreated cells. These results were consistent with the standard microscopic evaluation. Furthermore, a significant correlation between cell morphology and proliferation suggested that ultrasounds induced cell differentiation affecting cell morphology, as well as the ability of neurons and microglial cells to form complex networks. Our results suggest the possibility of using ultrasounds, currently utilized in diagnostics, to reconstitute neuronal and microglial circuits that are often altered in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. }}

Most of the recently proposed schemes are vulnerable to one or more security attacks and are inefficient in terms of processing time. In this paper, the scheme proposed by Xue et al. has been reviewed and it has been found that the scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack, stolen smart card attack, server spoofing attack. This paper proposes a robust and efficient password based authentication scheme which is secure against all well known security attacks. Moreover, the scheme has a low computation and communication cost and does not suffer from time synchronization problem. A formal security analysis has been performed using \{AVISPA\} tool to prove the security of the protocol. }}

In this paper we present a decision tool to aid train planners obtain quickly good quality routes and schedules for short time horizons (e.g., daily) to better manage the limited track capacity available for train movements. This decision tool is made up of an integer programming (IP)-based capacity management model and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based solution procedure. The capacity management model assigns trains to routes based on the statistical expectation of running times in order to balance the railroad traffic. The \{GA\} procedure determines the best initial routes and release times for trains to depart from origin stations and enter a network, given travel time estimates across aggregated sections of a network. We test our modeling technique by comparing the travel times obtained for a network in Los Angeles using these initial routes and release times, with those obtained from a simulation model, presented by Lu et al. (2004), which has been shown to be representative of the real-world travel times. Our experimental results show that our recommended solution procedure is capable of lowering travel times, as estimated by Lu et al. (2004), by up to 20%. }}

We propose a summarizing graph based on virtual and real links (SGVR) approach to aggregate similar nodes in a scale-free graph into k non-overlapping groups based on user-selected attributes considering both virtual links (attributes) and real links (graph structures). An effective data structure called HB-Graph is adopted to adjust the subgroups and optimize the grouping results. Extensive experiments are carried out on actual and synthetic datasets. Results indicate that our proposed method is both effective and efficient. }}

We consider a simple distributed communication protocol, which is based on gossip and on the local knowledge each node has about resources hold by its neighbors. In particular, upon reception (or generation) of a novel query, a node relays the message to those neighbors that have resources whose profile matches the query. Moreover, the node gossips the query to other remaining neighbors, so that the query can be disseminated through the overlay. A mathematical analysis is provided to estimate the number of nodes receiving the query (and consequently, the portion of query hits), based on the network topology, resource availability and gossip probability. Results show that the use of unstructured networks, coupled with simple dissemination protocols, represent a viable approach to build \{P2P\} resource discovery systems. }}

Modularity has previously been observed to vary as a function of working memory capacity, therefore we hypothesized that both small-worldness and modularity would show age-related declines. We found that both small-worldness and modularity were negatively correlated with increasing age but that this decline was relatively slow. }}

They provide powerful IT-innovations for online social activities such as organizing contacts, publishing content, and sharing interests between friends who may never meet before. As more and more people become active users of OSNs, one may ponder questions such as (1) Do \{OSNs\} indeed improve our sociability? (2) To what extent can we expand our offline social spectrum in OSNs? (3) Can we identify some interesting user behaviors in OSNs? Our work in this paper attempts to answer these interesting questions. First, we systematically validate the existence of a new Dunbar׳s number in OSNs, which is ranging from 200 to 300 empirically. To reach this, we conduct local-structure analysis as well as user-interaction analysis on extensive real-world OSNs. Second, based on this new number, we divide \{OSN\} users into two categories: the rational and the aggressive, and find that rational users intend to develop close and reciprocated relationship, whereas aggressive users have no consistent behaviors. Third, we propose a simple model to highlight the constraints of time and cognition that may affect the evolution of \{OSNs\} heavily. Finally, we discuss the potential use of our findings for viral marketing and privacy management in OSNs. }}

There are two main differences of this paper with previous works: one is that the intermittent pinning control is aperiodic while that in previous works is periodic; the other is that the model is generalized from master–slave coupled systems of only two nodes to general nonlinear coupled networks. By using the aperiodically intermittent pinning control technique, a simple controller to pin the coupled networks to achieve quasi-synchronization is designed. Some sufficient criteria are obtained to guarantee global quasi-synchronization. Moreover, an adaptive algorithm for the control strength is also proposed to realize the quasi-synchronization. Finally, numerical simulations are given to show the validity of our theoretical results. }}

This paper presents a vertices similarity probability (VSP) model to find community structure without the priori knowledge of the type of complex network structure. As vertices in the same community have similar properties, the \{VSP\} model uses vertices similarity to find community structure which is a unified algorithm and can be used in any network without knowing the type of network structure. As “Common neighbor index” has been proved to be an effective index for vertices similarity, it is used to measure the vertices similarity probability. Then, we give the method to determine the number of communities using matrix perturbation theory. We apply the model to find community structure in real-world networks and artificial networks. The experimental results show that the \{VSP\} model is applicable to both unipartite networks and bipartite networks, and is able to find the community structure successfully without using the type of network structure. }}

We conjecture that preserving the universal network properties is a necessary step in artificial composition of music. Power-law exponents of node degree, node strength and/or edge weight distributions, mean degrees, clustering coefficients, mean geodesic distances, etc. are reported. With the network constructed, music can be composed artificially using a controlled random walk algorithm, which begins with a randomly chosen note and selects the subsequent notes according to a simple set of rules that compares the weights of the edges, weights of the nodes, and/or the degrees of nodes. By generating a large number of compositions, we find that this algorithm generates music which has the necessary qualities to be subjectively judged as appealing. }}

This is determined due the fact that most of the current reported molecular descriptors encode only information about the molecular structure. As a result, predicting the probability with which a drug is active against different viral species only with a single unifying model is a goal of major importance. In this paper we use the Markov Chain theory to calculate new multi-target entropy to fit a \{QSAR\} model that predicts by the first time an mt-QSAR model for 500 drugs tested in the literature against 40 viral species. We used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify drugs into two classes as active or non-active against the different tested viral species whose data we processed. The model correctly classifies 1424 out of 1445 non-active compounds (98.55%) and 281 out of 333 active compounds (84.38%). Overall training predictability was 95.89%. Validation of the model was carried out by means of external predicting series, the model classifying, thus, 698 out of 704 non-active compounds and 143 out of 157 active compounds. Overall validation predictability was 97.68%. The present work reports the first attempts to calculate within a unify framework probabilities of antiviral drugs against different virus species based on entropy analysis. We assembled for the first time a drug–virus complex network, for observed possible mechanism of action for the different drugs against viruses. }}

By providing a topology-dependent Lyapunov function, it is shown that distributed consensus tracking can be achieved in finite time under the condition that the nonlinear errors between the leader and the followers are bounded. Then, a new class of observer-based algorithms are designed to solve the finite-time consensus tracking problem without using relative velocity measurements. The main contribution of this paper is that, by computing the value of the Lyapunov function at the initial point, the finite settling time can be theoretically estimated for second-order multi-agent systems with the proposed control protocols. Finally, the effectiveness of the analytical results is illustrated by an application in low-Earth-orbit spacecraft formation flying. }}
