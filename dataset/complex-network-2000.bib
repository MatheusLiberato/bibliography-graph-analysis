The modeling of the bioreactor in our work is based on the zone cell network model for the stirred tank reactor containing two physical phases. In addition, devices in the reactor periphery and process control functions can be simulated. The models for process engineering and biological processes are formulated separately and implemented in a suitable program structure. The program enables to calculate different combinations of biological models and submodels in a process technology context. Different aspects of process technology (feeding strategies, control loops) can be included in the dynamic simulation. The modular integration of the biological phase models into the program structure also allows the transfer to complex network of zones modeling approaches. "

Extracellular signals that induce cells to divide, differentiate, or die trigger a complex network of cellular signaling pathways. Most often this process relies on the transfer of biological information from cell surface receptors to the nucleus, and \{GTPases\} belonging to the Ras superfamily play a pivotal role in this transfer. One approach that has been taken to interfere with oncogenic signaling of the Ras superfamily of proteins is to design compounds that block their prenylation—a lipid posttranslational modification that is required for the transforming activity of the GTPases. The chapter also discusses the activity assays of protein geranylgeranyltransferase I (PGGTase I) and protein farnesyltransferase (PFTase) inhibitors. "

The critical ethnographic study upon which this paper is based involved a research group of six nurses who worked in one critical care unit. Data-collection methods involved professional journalling, participant observation, and individual and focus group interviews. The nursing handover took on many forms and served different purposes. At the start of a shift, the nurse coordinator of the previous shift presented a ‘global’ handover of all patients to oncoming nurses. Nurses proceeded then to the bedside handover, where the intention changed from one that involved a broad overview of patients, to one that concentrated on a patient’s individual needs. Data analysis identified five practices for consideration: the global handover serving the needs of nurse coordinators; the examination; the tyranny of tidiness; the tyranny of busyness; and the need to create a sense of finality. In challenging nurses’ understanding of these practices, they can become more sensitive to other nurses’ needs, thus promoting the handover process as a site for collaborative and supportive communication.

They are internally differentiated: some members occupy a central position in the group, others are on the periphery or somewhere in between. This way of characterising a group is intuitive to seasoned observers but social network analysts seek a more systematic method for determining groups. Freeman [Freeman, L.C., 1996. Cliques, Galois lattices, and the structure of human social groups, Social Networks 18, 173–187.] describes a formal model based on the concept of overlapping social network cliques. Freeman's analysis produces results that are consistent with ethnographic results but his technique is not easily implemented for very large data sets. This paper describes two algorithms based on Freeman's clique–lattice analysis. The first implements his technique exactly; the second is a modification that exploits the clique structure, thereby enabling the analysis of large complex networks. We apply both algorithms to a real data set and compare the results. "

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdk inactivation is triggered by the phosphatase Cdc14, which is activated by a complex network of regulatory proteins that includes the protein kinase Cdc15 [3–6]. Here we show that the ability of Cdc15 to promote mitotic exit is inhibited by phosphorylation. Cdc15 is phosphorylated in vivo at multiple Cdk-consensus sites during most of the cell cycle, but is transiently dephosphorylated in late mitosis. Although phosphorylation appears to have no effect on Cdc15 kinase activity, a non-phosphorylatable mutant of Cdc15 is a more potent stimulator of mitotic exit than wild-type Cdc15, indicating that phosphorylation inhibits Cdc15 function in vivo. Interestingly, inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc15 is removed by the phosphatase Cdc14 in vitro, and overproduction of Cdc14 leads to Cdc15 dephosphorylation in vivo. Thus, Cdc15 serves both as an activator and substrate of Cdc14. Although this scheme raises the possibility that positive feedback promotes Cdc14 activation, we present evidence that such feedback is not essential for Cdc14 activation in vivo. Instead, Cdc15 dephosphorylation may promote some additional function of Cdc15 that is independent of its effects on Cdc14 activation. "

The foundation was subjected to a vertical eccentric load and to a sine dwell-type acceleration transmitted from a shaking table over which the shear stack was located.

To have a detailed description of the behaviour of the footing under the seismic motion, four coloured layers of sand were introduced into the deposit at different depths.

We have developed a novel and generic approach to create supported lipid membranes tethered by metal-affinity binding. By self-assembly we have generated various interfaces that display histidine sequences (6xHis) via polymer spacers. These histidine-functionalized interfaces are designed to allow specific docking and fusion of vesicles containing metal-chelating lipids. By means of surface plasmon resonance and atomic force microscopy we analyzed the formation and subsequently the structure of these solid-supported membranes. Although the affinity constant of single ligand-receptor pairs is only in the micromolar range, very stable immobilization of these membranes was observed. This behavior can be explained by multivalent interactions resembling many features of cell adhesion. The process is highly specific, because vesicle docking and bilayer formation are strictly dependent on the presence of metal-affinity ligand-receptor pairs. The surface accessibility and geometry of these tethered membranes were probed by binding of histidine-tagged polypeptides. The supported membranes show adsorption kinetics and values similar to planar supported monolayers. Using various combinations of metal-chelating and histidine-tagged lipids or thiols these metal-affinity-tethered membranes should make a great impact on probing and eventually understanding the dynamic dialog of reconstituted membrane proteins.

These cytokines form a complex network of molecular and cellular interactions that mediate protective immunity to worm infection, but also induce inappropriate inflammatory responses to allergic challenge. Although considerable attention has been given to the roles played by IL-4 in Th2 responses, the identification of the related cytokine IL-13 has led to a re-evaluation of how these two molecules combine in the generation of Th2 immunity. Recent reports have highlighted that in certain challenges, IL-4 and IL-13 act in combination to ensure the rapid onset of a Th2-like response. However, these studies have also identified specific responses that are attributable to the individual cytokines. For example, IL-13 appears to play a more dominant role than IL-4 in the expulsion of certain gastrointestinal parasites. In contrast, following schistosome infection, IL-13 induces a detrimental hepatic fibrosis, while IL-4 protects against endotoxemia. These results emphasise the complexity of the cytokine network, and highlight the care that needs to be taken when designing therapeutic intervention. "

During most of the 1980s, a great effort was put into the characterization of stimulatory cell surface receptors for cytokines and growth factors. In the last decade, a large number of inhibitory receptors have been identified and it has become apparent that inhibitory signaling pathways are subject to intricate regulatory mechanisms. Inhibitory and stimulatory signaling pathways work in concert with each other to establish activation thresholds and provide sensitive tuning mechanisms that help control cellular responses. LIRs/ILTs/MIRs are a novel family of inhibitory and stimulatory receptors expressed both in myeloid and lymphoid cells. They contain two or four immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and their cytoplasmic domains are either very short and without any signaling motifs or are long and contain a variable number of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). \{LIRs\} within the first group send stimulatory signals by association with the FcR common γ chain and \{LIRs\} within the second group deliver inhibitory signals by association with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the LIRs, their ligands, and biological functions. "

TGF-β expression in the prostate is under negative regulatory control of androgen. As experimental diabetes causes a regression of the prostate and decrease in serum testosterone levels in rats, we examined TGF-β alterations at the mRNA and protein levels in the diabetic rat prostate. Materials and Methods The expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 and their respective mRNAs in prostates from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic, insulin-treated diabetic and age-matched control rats were investigated, using relative multiplex RT-PCR, semi-quantitative Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results Induction of diabetes caused a significant reduction in prostatic weight and in serum testosterone levels in rats. Both mRNA and protein levels of TGF-β1, and mRNA level of TGF-β2 were up-regulated in the diabetic rat prostate. Insulin-treatment normalized changes observed in prostatic weight and serum testosterone levels, and reversed the alterations in the TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 expression at the gene transcript and protein levels to control levels. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that TGF-β1 is localized to prostatic stromal cells, whereas TGF-β2 is located in both epithelial and stromal cells. Conclusion These results suggest that TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 may be involved in the diabetes-induced regression of the prostate gland. "

We analyzed the expression of Eps15 and Eps15R during murine development, at the time of active neurogenesis. The most striking difference was at the level of subcellular localization, with Eps15 present in the cytosol and on the plasma membrane, while Eps15R exhibited mainly a nuclear localization. Interesting topographical differences also emerged. In the 12.5 days post coitum neuroepithelium, Eps15 was expressed in the ventricular zone, which contains proliferating neuroblasts, whereas Eps15R was found only in postmitotic neurons. Conversely, both proteins were expressed in sensory and cranial ganglia. At later times, the expression of Eps15 and Eps15R was widely maintained in neuronal structures. In other tissues, Eps15 was first seen in the liver primordium and at low levels in choroid plexus, lung, kidney and intestine; later on the expression was maintained at high levels in epithelia. Nuclear staining of Eps15R was present in kidney, intestine, lung and liver, as well as in heart and pancreas. "

Ink4 proteins act by antagonizing the formation and activation of cyclin D-CDK4 complexes, of which the ultimate downstream target as related to S-phase entry appears to be pRb. Cip/Kip inhibitors impinge upon that pathway by inhibiting \{CDK2\} kinases that participate in the inactivation of pRb and, like cyclin E, may also have roles independent of pRb. How the activities of these three classes of proteins are coordinated remains obscure. In recent years, development of mouse models has accelerated the elucidation of this complex network, showing roles that are sometimes cooperative and sometimes overlapping. We will discuss the interrelationships between Cip/Kip inhibitors and the components of the pRb pathway, and how their activities ultimately regulate cell proliferation. "

These models were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and by immunohistochemistry to determine the staining patterns of fibrillin-1 and elastin proteins representative of the microfibrillar framework and of the elastic fibers, respectively. After 2 mo of fibroblast culture in the dermal equivalent, elastin was undetectable, whereas fibrillin-1 staining was weak and microfibrils were infrequently observed by TEM. In the skin equivalent, fibrillin-1 and elastin were detected by immunostaining 15 d after epidermization and \{TEM\} revealed the typical structure and organization of the elastic network in the dermis, with elastin deposition on the microfibrillar scaffold.

An integrated study has been undertaken in order to explain the Miocene to Present kinematic evolution of the north-western Alps. Data from remote sensing, structural geology, seismotectonics and thermochronology have been analysed and compared. Remote sensing and structural analysis evidence that the Pennine-Graian nappe stack constitutes a continuous block, characterised by high-strain border-zones and by a quite homogenous internal deformation. The border-zones of this block are: (i) the normal SW-dipping Simplon fault; (ii) the broad dextral strike-slip system, constituted by the Rhone and Chamonix lines and by the Penninic and Briançonnais reactivated frontal thrusts, and, to the \{SE\} of the block, (iii) the recently discovered sinistral strike-slip Ospizio Sottile fault. A complex network of faults and fractures dissects the Pennine-Graian block, the most important being the E–W striking Aosta-Ranzola fault system. Even if these faults do not generally show large displacements in the Miocene, they constitute an important strain marker, since they have a regular frequency and indicate a general NE–SW extension of the block. Seismicity is mainly concentrated along the strike-slip border-zones and focal plane solutions generally agree with surface data (within discussed errors). Thermochronology indicates that, from the Late Miocene onwards, no major changes took place in the exhumation pattern, and hence in the overall kinematics. This evidence supports the general agreement between present-day deformation (seismotectonic data) and kinematics in the recent-past (structural geology data). Different tectonic reconstructions are checked with the discussed data set. In the authors’ opinion, the SW-ward orogen-parallel escape model better explain the presented body of structural, seismotectonic and thermochronology evidences. "

abstract = {The anorexia of infection is part of the host’s acute phase response (APR). Despite being beneficial in the beginning, long lasting anorexia delays recovery and is ultimately deleterious. Microbial products such as bacterial cell wall compounds (e.g., lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans), microbial nucleic acids (e.g., bacterial \{DNA\} and viral double-stranded RNA), and viral glycoproteins trigger the \{APR\} and presumably also the anorexia during infections. Microbial products stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins [ILs], tumor necrosis factor-α, interferons), which serve as endogenous mediators. Several microbial products and cytokines reduce food intake after parenteral administration, suggesting a role of these substances in the anorexia during infection. Microbial products are mainly released and cytokines are produced in the periphery during most infections; they might inhibit feeding through neural and humoral pathways activated by their peripheral actions. Activation of peripheral afferents by locally produced cytokines is involved in several cytokine effects, but is not crucial for the anorectic effect of microbial products and IL-1β. Cytokines increase leptin expression in the adipose tissue, and leptin may contribute to, but is also not essential for, the anorectic effects of microbial products and cytokines. In addition, a direct action of cytokines and microbial products on the central nervous system (CNS) is presumably involved in the anorexia during infection. Cytokines can reach \{CNS\} receptors through circumventricular organs and through active or passive transport mechanisms or they can act through receptors on endothelial cells of the brain vasculature and stimulate the release of subsequent mediators such as eicosanoids. De novo \{CNS\} cytokine synthesis occurs in response to peripheral infections, but its role in the accompanying anorexia is still open to discussion. Central mediators of the anorexia during infection appear to be neurochemicals involved in the normal control of feeding, such as serotonin, dopamine, histamine, corticotropin releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Reciprocal, synergistic, and antagonistic interactions between various pleiotropic cytokines, and between cytokines and neurochemicals, form a complex network that mediates the anorexia during infection. Current knowledge on the mechanisms involved suggests some therapeutic options for treatment. Substances that block common key steps in cytokine synthesis or cytokine action, or inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis, may hold more promise than attempts to antagonize specific cytokines. To target the neurochemical mediation of the anorexia during infection may be even more efficient. Future research should address these neurochemical mechanisms and the cytokine actions at the blood–brain barrier. Further unanswered questions concern the modulation of the anorexia during infection by gender and nutritional state. "

Functional synaptic connections were examined by recording simultaneously from pairs of neurons using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique.

The varying capability of normal and malignant cells to recognize and repair specific \{DNA\} lesions influences both cancer risk and the relative sensitivity or resistance of cancer cells towards cytotoxic agents. Using monoclonal antibody-based immunoanalytical assays, very low amounts of defined carcinogen-DNA adducts can be quantified in bulk genomic DNA, in individual genes, and in the nuclear \{DNA\} of single cells. \{DNA\} repair kinetics can, thus, be measured in a lesion-, gene-, and cell type-specific manner, and the \{DNA\} repair profiles of malignant cells can be monitored in individual patients. Even structurally very similar \{DNA\} lesions may be repaired with strongly differing efficiency. The miscoding \{DNA\} alkylation products O6-methylguanine and O6-ethylguanine, for example, differ only by one \{CH2\} group. These lesions are formed in \{DNA\} upon exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, both of which induce mammary adenocarcinomas in female rats at high yield. Unrepaired O6-alkylguanines in \{DNA\} cause G:C→A:T transition mutations via mispairing during \{DNA\} replication. O6-methylguanines are repaired at a similar slow rate in both transcriptionally active (H-ras, β-actin) and inactive genes (IgE heavy chain; bulk DNA) of the target mammary epithelia (which express the repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) at a very low level). In contrast, O6-ethylguanines are repaired ∼20 times faster than O6-methylguanines in both \{DNA\} strands of the transcribed genes selectively via an AGT-independent, as yet unclarified excision mechanism. Accordingly, G:C→A:T transitions resulting from the misreplication of an O6-methylated guanine at the second position of codon 12 (GGA) of H-ras represent a frequent “signature” mutation in rat mammary adenocarcinomas that develop after exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. However, this mutation is not observed when these tumors are induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, due to the fast repair of O6-ethylguanines in the H-ras gene. The key importance of “conventional” and “conditional” gene knockout technology for resolving the intricacies of the complex network of \{DNA\} repair pathways is briefly discussed. "

abstract = {This paper presents a theory-inflected consideration of how \{UK\} retailers play an active role in shaping the character of the international cut flower trade. More particularly, the centrality of knowledge to this role is examined. It is suggested that the metaphor of the network most effectively captures the vast webs of interdependent relationships that constitute the trade in cut flowers, while the metaphor of the circuit is used to understand the flow of knowledge through this network. The development and application of business knowledge by \{UK\} retailers, in the context of exchange relationships with flower producers in Kenya, is discussed. The author's preliminary field interviews with these agents are drawn upon, in order to demonstrate how the power of retailers to influence change in the cut flower trade hinges on their capacity to adapt complex networks in their favour and to circulate particular kinds of knowledge around these networks.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the design of an Operations System (OS) framework for implementing a proper telecommunications network in Korea Telecom. Since several types of \{OS\} frameworks are under consideration, the telecommunication network manager should now choose the best alternative for use later in establishing the infrastructure of operations systems. The decision making is done in this paper by means of a Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) analysis. A point to be noted in the present case is that the decision relevant information such as attribute weights and values of alternatives are not known exactly. Rather, these are to be taken in the form of rankings and/or bounds. To deal with such incomplete information, we employ a mathematical programming model-based \{MADM\} approach to the choice of an optimal \{OS\} framework design. This approach enables us to check dominance of alternatives and to obtain a set of non-dominated alternatives from evaluating five alternatives in reference to Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) standards. Scope and purpose Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) can be stated as a globalized and unified skeleton to meet the advanced operational environments of telecommunications networks and to handle heterogeneous and complex network elements. Although there are various subjects that should be addressed to accomplish TMN, we confine our attention to dealing with one important subject, design of an Operations System (OS) framework. This is necessary to manage telecommunications resources including networks in effective manner and for use as guidance in developing individual operations systems and in constructing a network management center. Several types of \{OS\} frameworks have been suggested by \{TMN\} standards. It is hence needed to evaluate each of these \{OS\} frameworks and then to choose an appropriate one in Korean \{TMN\} situation. Since this evaluation involves multiple criteria (or attributes), it is realized in this paper by a Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) analysis approach. The decision relevant information such as trade-off weights and individual criterion values are elicited from expert opinions which, however, is rather incomplete than exact numerical values. The decision making process with the incompletely identified information is presented in this paper. "

abstract = {The peopling of southern Italy must be traced back to the first expansion of the early forms of our species because of the geographical location of this area in the middle of the Mediterranean basin. Since then, the area was the site of a complex network of migration of different peoples, mainly from Phoenicia, Greece, Arabia, the Balkans, the Middle and Near East and north Africa, resulting in a heterogeneous pattern of both cultural and genetic interactions. In order to test the extent of the genetic impact of these various populations upon the peoples of southern Italy, a mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA)-based research program was undertaken. This would help trace the geographic origin and past history of these populations. Previous detailed and extensive investigations on the distribution of traditional marker allele frequencies in the Sicilian and Apulian extant populations, could only clearly detect the presence of the more recent gene flow from north Africa and the Middle East, superimposed on a predominant Greek genetic substratum. No traces of the ancient groups who peopled Italy in pre-Roman times were detected. Other authors still claim that it is possible to determine the existence of such ancient traces in southern Italy, stressing the difficulties connected to the reconstruction of human evolution based uniquely on the present structure of the genes. Until recently, population genetic studies have heavily relied upon indirect evidence from the genetics of extant populations as well as information gained from cultural, historical and anthropological sources. The possibility to recover \{DNA\} from ancient soft tissue, bone and teeth, and the development of sensitive molecular techniques, such as PCR, have enabled us to directly compare genetic diversity between extinct populations and their extant counterparts. This has also provided a temporal dimension to the study of molecular evolution. These comparisons will generate independent data to address archaeological issues concerning migration, population replacement, lineage extinction, inbreeding, and the genetic relationships of ancient human populations. \{DNA\} from bone and tooth samples obtained from the necropoles of Rifriscolaro (6th century BC) and Ticchiara (Bronze age), and \{DNA\} of extant populations from various Mediterranean areas, were extracted and analysed for mtDNA polymorphisms (region V, D-loop I and II). Moreover, in order to identify the remains of the family of the Prince Branciforte (a Sicilian maecenas and benefactor who lived between 16th and 17th centuries), molecular sex identification and mitochondrial \{DNA\} (mtDNA) analyses were used. a-DNA were extracted from the ribs of two adult and three young individuals. \{NJ\} and \{ML\} phylogenetic reconstructions, performed to verify the reliability of the identified ancient lineages, confirmed the clustering of the Mediterranean mtDNAs into distinct lineage groups, each defined by a set of associated polymorphisms. The joint analysis of D-loop I and \{II\} allowed the identification of at least three distinct lineages within the previously identified aplogroup 1 (or H). "

The three-dimensional structures of the oxidised and reduced Desulfovibrio gigas cytochrome c3 in solution were solved using 2D 1H-NMR data. The reduced protein structures were calculated using INDYANA, an extended version of \{DYANA\} that allows automatic calibration of \{NOE\} data. The oxidised protein structure, which includes four paramagnetic centres, was solved using the program PARADYANA, which also includes the structural paramagnetic parameters. In this case, initial structures were used to correct the upper and lower volume restraints for paramagnetic leakage, and angle restraints derived from 13C Fermi contact shifts of haem moiety substituents were used for the axial histidine ligands. Despite the reduction of the \{NOE\} intensities by paramagnetic relaxation, the final family of structures is of similar precision and accuracy to that obtained for the reduced form. Comparison of the two structures shows that, although the global folds of the two families of structures are similar, significant localised differences occur upon change of redox state, some of which could not be detected by comparison with the X-ray structure of the oxidised state: (1) there is a redox-linked concerted rearrangement of Lys80 and Lys90 that results in the stabilisation of haem moieties \{II\} and \{III\} when both molecules are oxidised or both are reduced, in agreement with the previously measured positive redox cooperativity between these two haem moieties. This cooperativity regulates electron transfer, enabling a two-electron step adapted to the function of cytochromes c3 as the coupling partner of hydrogenase; and (2) the movement of haem I propionate 13 towards the interior of the protein upon reduction explains the positive redox-Bohr effect, establishing the structural basis for the redox-linked proton activation mechanism necessary for energy conservation, driving \{ATP\} synthesis.

abstract = {Communication through gap junction channels provides a major signaling mechanism during early brain histogenesis, a developmental time during which neural progenitor cells are inexcitable and do not express ligand-gated channel responses to the major \{CNS\} neurotransmitters. Expression of different gap junction types during neurogenesis may therefore define intercellular pathways for transmission of developmentally relevant molecules. To better understand the molecular mechanism(s) by which growth and differentiation of neurons are modulated by gap junction channels, we have been examining the developmental effects of a specific set of cytokines on differentiation and gap junction expression in a conditionally immortalized mouse embryonic hippocampal neuronal progenitor cell line (MK31). When multipotent \{MK31\} cells are in an uncommitted state, they uniformly express the neuroepithelial intermediate filament class \{VI\} marker, nestin, are strongly coupled by gap junctions composed of connexin43 (Cx43) and express connexin45 (Cx45) at the mRNA level. As these cells undergo neuronal lineage commitment and exit from cell cycle, they begin to express the early neurofilament marker, NF66, and coupling strength and expression of Cx43 begin to decline with concurrent expression of other connexin proteins, including Cx26, Cx33, Cx36, Cx40 and Cx45. Terminal neuronal differentiation is heralded by the expression of more advanced neurofilament proteins, increased morphologic maturation, the elaboration of inward currents and action potentials that possess mature physiological properties, and changing profiles of expression of connexin subtypes, including upregulation of Cx36 expression. These important developmental transitions are regulated by a complex network of cell cycle checkpoints. To begin to examine the precise roles of gap junction proteins in traversing these developmental checkpoints and in thus regulating neurogenesis, we have focused on individual members of two classes of genes involved in these seminal events: \{ID\} (inhibitor of differentiation)-1 and \{GAS\} (growth arrest-specific gene)5. When \{MK31\} cells were maintained in an uncommitted state, levels of ID-1 mRNA were high and \{GAS5\} transcripts were essentially undetectable. Application of cytokines that promote neuronal lineage commitment and cell cycle exit resulted in down-regulation of ID-1 and upregulation of \{GAS5\} transcripts, whereas additional cytokine paradigms that promoted terminal neuronal differentiation resulted in the delayed down-regulation of \{GAS5\} mRNA. Stable \{MK31\} transfectants were generated for ID-1 and GAS5. In basal conditions, cellular proliferation was enhanced in the ID-1 transfectants and inhibited in the \{GAS5\} transfectants when compared with control \{MK31\} cells. When cytokine-mediated neurogenesis was examined in these transfected cell lines, constitutive expression of ID-1 inhibited and constitutive expression of \{GAS5\} enhanced initial and terminal stages of neuronal differentiation, with evidence that terminal neuronal maturation in both transfectant lines was associated with decreased cellular viability, possibly due to the presence of conflicting cell cycle-associated developmental signals. These experimental reagents will prove to be valuable experimental tools to help define the functional interrelationships between changing profiles of connexin protein expression and cell cycle regulation during neuronal ontogeny in the mammalian brain. The present review summarizes the current state of research involving the temporal expression of such connexin types in differentiating hippocampal neurons and speculates on the possible role of these intercellular channels in the development and plasticity of the nervous system. In addition, we describe the functional properties and expression pattern of the newly discovered neuronal-specific gap junctional protein, Cx36, in the developing mouse fetal hippocampus and in the rat retina and brain.

One general approach is to ask the respondents (egos) to delineate the core members (alters) of their personal networks according to affective criteria (e.g., “the most significant people in your life”). Another approach provides more guidance to the egos by asking about alters with whom they have had specific interactions or social exchanges (e.g., “discuss important matters”). Finally, most name generators have been criticized for their preoccupation with positive ties to the exclusion of the difficult or negative relationships that may be an important part of ego's social world. An experiment (2×2 factorial design) was embedded within an interviewer-administered survey of 426 college students to explore the effects on reported network size and composition of (a) varying the delineation criteria (“significant people” or the 1985 General Social Survey (GSS) “important matters”) and (b) including or excluding a probe for negative interactions (“These may include people that sometimes make you angry or upset”). The name-generator wording manipulations produced modest network compositional differences (ego–alter role relationships and discussion topics) that varied by the sex of both egos and their alters. Compared to the “important matters” criterion, the “significant people” generator elicited slightly more cross-sex relatives and fewer same-sex close friends and co-workers from female (but not male) respondents. The negative probe produced some statistically significant but substantively unimportant compositional differences. The results suggest that major differences in name-generator wording may in some situations have little or no effect on reported egocentric networks. "

Isotope labelling provides a powerful approach for measuring metabolic fluxes, and it gives rise to several distinct methods based on either dynamic or steady-state experiments. We discuss the application of these methods to photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic plant tissues, and we illustrate the different approaches with an analysis of the pathways interconverting hexose phosphates and triose phosphates. The complicating effects of the pentose phosphate pathway and the problems arising from the extensive compartmentation of plant cell metabolism are considered. The non-trivial nature of the analysis is emphasised by reference to invalid deductions in earlier work. It is concluded that steady-state isotopic labelling experiments can provide important information on the fluxes through primary metabolism in plants, and that the combination of stable isotope labelling with detection by nuclear magnetic resonance is particularly informative.

abstract = {The purpose of this tutorial is to provide concepts and historical background of the “network integration testing” (NIT) methodology. \{NIT\} is a “grey box” testing technique that is aimed at verifying the correct behaviour of interconnected networks (operated by different operators) in provisioning services to end users, or the behaviour of a complex network operated by a unique operator. The main technical concepts behind this technique are presented along with the history of some International projects that have contributed to its early definition and application. European Institute for Research and Strategic Studies in Telecommunication (EURESCOM) has actually been very active, with many projects, in defining the \{NIT\} basic methodology and providing actual \{NIT\} specifications (for narrow-band and broad-band services, covering both voice and data). \{EURESCOM\} has also been acting as a focal point in the area, e.g., encouraging the Industry in developing commercial tools supporting NIT. In particular, the \{EURESCOM\} \{P412\} project (1994–1996) first explicitly defined the \{NIT\} methodology (the methodological aspects include test notation, test implementation, test processes, distributed testing and related co-ordination aspects). \{P412\} applied the methodology to \{ISDN\} whilst another project, P410, applied \{NIT\} to data services. The \{P613\} project (1997–1999) extended the basic \{NIT\} methodology to the broad band and GSM. More into details, the areas covered currently by \{NIT\} test specifications developed by \{EURESCOM\} projects include N-ISDN, N-ISUP, POTS, B-ISDN, B-ISUP, \{IP\} over ATM, ATM/FR, GSM, focusing also on their “inter-working” cases (e.g., ISDN/ISDN, ISDN/GSM, etc.). ETSI, the European Telecommunication Standards Institute, also contributed to \{NIT\} development (e.g., the definition of the TSP1+ protocol, used for the functional co-ordination and timing synchronisation of all tools involved in a distributed testing session). The paper also discusses \{NIT\} in relation to the recent major changes (processes) within the telecommunication (TLC) community. Beyond the new needs coming from the pure technical aspects (integration of voice and data, fixed mobile convergence, etc.) the full deregulation of the \{TLC\} sector has already generated new processes and new testing needs (e.g., Interconnection Testing) that had a significant influence on the methodology. \{NIT\} is likely to continue to develop further in the future according to the needs of telecom operators, authorities, user’s associations and suppliers.

The purpose of this study was to recognize gait pattern in ankle arthrodesis by using a neural network trained with time domain input and compare the performance of the neural network with the statistical method. Design. Three-layered feed-forward back propagation neural network and a statistical method were used to classify gait patterns of patients with ankle arthrodesis and normal subjects. Background. Although backpropagation neural networks are very efficient in many pattern recognition tasks, they have not been used for gait pattern recognition of ankle arthrodesis. Methods. A total of eighteen parameters measured by force platforms, including nine force parameters and their chronologic incidence of occurrence, were used to classify gait patterns. Results. The results showed that the neural network model was able to classify subjects with recognition rates up to 95.8%. In contrast, the statistical method was only able to classify the subjects with recognition rates of 91.5%. Conclusions. The backpropagation neural network method has better accuracy than the statistical method in discriminating subjects and the time domain features carry important prognostic information.Relevance It is important to be able to quantify the changes in gait pattern after arthrodesis to understand the clinical implications of arthrodesis.

These were then spin-coated on the substrates and irradiated by Xe2∗ excimer lamps operating at a wavelength of 172 nm. The chemical bonding changes in the thin films were analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), which confirmed densification of the films and the removal of \{H2O\} and \{OH\} groups after some 10 min irradiation at 300°C. Layer thicknesses between 18–140 nm were readily achievable by this technique whose refractive index, n, increased from 1.6 after spin on to 2 after irradiation.

abstract = {Modelling ecological systems implies to take into account different ecological levels: the individual, population, community and ecosystem levels. Two large families of models can be distinguished among different approaches: (i) completely detailed models involving many variables and parameters; (ii) more simple models involving only few state variables. The first class of models are usually more realistic including many details as for example the internal structure of the population. Nevertheless, the mathematical analysis is not always possible and only computer simulations can be performed. The second class of models can mathematically be analysed, but they sometimes neglect some details and remain unrealistic. We present here a review of aggregation methods, which can be seen as a compromise between these two previous modelling approaches. They are applicable for models involving two levels of organisation and the corresponding time scales. The most detailed level of description is usually associated to a fast time scale, while the coarser one rather corresponds to a slow time scale. A detailed model is thus considered at the individual level, containing many micro-variables and consisting of two parts: a fast and a slow one. Aggregation methods allow then to reduce the dimension of the initial dynamical system to an aggregated one governing few global variables evolving at the slow time scale. We focus our attention on the emerging properties of individual behaviours at the population and community levels. "

Hypoplasia of the \{VI\} and \{VII\} vermian lobules are accompanied by autistic-like pictures, whereas damage to the VIII, \{IX\} and X lobules is associated with attention disturbances.

The studies were conducted in drifts located at ca. 300 m and ca. 700 m below the surface in the former Kamaishi iron ore mine, situated in the Kurihashi granodiorite, an early Cretaceous granitic rock (110∼120 Ma) in the Kitakami area, Iwate Prefecture, northeastern Japan. The fractures identified in the Kurihashi granodiorite were mainly formed during the early stages of the cooling process. The mineralogical and dating data suggest that almost no new fractures have been generated since 70∼60 Ma ago. The fractures have high-porosity fracture fillings with relatively high sorption values that imply the fractured granitic rock could have a significant retardation capability for contaminant transport through the granite. Monitoring of hydrological and geochemical conditions of groundwater for 10 years showed that even fractured granitic rock close to the drift is not thoroughly oxidized, and there are only negligible changes of hydrological conditions and groundwater geochemistry due to earthquakes. This information is of considerable importance for the practical design of a \{HLW\} repository and to assess any impact of the pre-closure conditions on the post-closure performance of the geological repository.

In an attempt to impart controllable selectivity of a definite nature, carboxymethyl cellulose was developed as a soluble ion-exchange precipitant for isolation and purification of proteins. Carboxymethyl cellulose was used as a reversibly soluble/insoluble ion exchange matrix, which after binding proteins from ‘crude’ could be precipitated quantitatively with a combination of calcium and polyethylene glycol. The precipitated proteins were recovered by solubilising in a dissociating buffer devoid of any one or both of the precipitants i.e. calcium and polyethylene glycol; followed by reprecipitating of carboxymethyl cellulose. Lactoperoxidase was used as a model enzyme and purified from milk whey using the proposed system. A purification factor of about four was achieved in a single step of precipitation with a suitable choice of binding and elution conditions. "

The methodology is assessed using multivariate hydrological time series from Chute-du-Diable hydrosystem in northern Quebec (Canada). The performance of the model is compared to benchmarks from a statistical model and an operational conceptual model. Since the ultimate goal concerns the real-time forecast accuracy, overall the results show that the proposed method is effective for improving prediction accuracy.

abstract = {Objectives. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is a disorder characterized by pelvic pain and varying degrees of inflammation exhibited in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS). To provide objective parameters of inflammation, we measured the cytokines interleukin 8 (IL-8) and epithelial neutrophil activating peptide 78 (ENA-78) in \{EPS\} of healthy men, men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), men with bacterial prostatitis (BP), and men with chronic prostatitis/CPPS. Methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of the \{EPS\} for IL-8 and ENA-78 were done in 63 men: control (n = 9), \{BPH\} (n = 6), \{BP\} (n = 3), inflammatory \{CPPS\} (National Institutes of Health [NIH] category IIIa) (n = 17), noninflammatory \{CPPS\} (NIH category IIIb) (n = 17), and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis (NIH category IV) (n = 11). Results. IL-8 was detectable in all patients, and ENA-78 was detectable in all except 2 patients (threshold of detection 10 pg/mL for IL-8, 15 pg/mL for ENA-78). Mean levels of IL-8 [ENA-78] were similar in control (3010 pg/mL [423 pg/mL]), \{BPH\} (3341 pg/mL [98 pg/mL]), and \{IIIb\} (2751 pg/mL [335 pg/mL]) groups. Both cytokine levels were higher in \{BP\} (11,175 pg/mL [13,761 pg/mL]), \{IIIa\} (10,418 pg/mL [2240 pg/mL]), and \{IV\} (8571 pg/mL [1865 pg/mL]) groups. A statistically significant difference between the control group versus BP, IIIa, and \{IV\} (P &lt;0.05) groups was found for IL-8 but not for ENA-78. Conclusions. IL-8 and ENA-78 are frequently elevated in the \{EPS\} of men with BP, \{CPPS\} IIIa, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis category IV. These cytokines are direct mediators of leukocyte accumulation and activation at inflammatory sites and may be responsible, in part, for the presence of inflammatory reaction in the prostate. "

Protein oxidation and glycation are tightly linked and are implicated in the development of many pathological consequences of aging. Although multiple endogenous pathways in the cell can prevent the formation of oxidized and glycated proteins, and repair and degrade abnormal proteins, such abnormal proteins do accumulate during aging. The heat shock response involving the family of stress-proteins or the so-called heat shock proteins (HSP), represents the quickest and highly conserved response to proteotoxic insults. Since repeated mild heat stress is able to prevent the onset of various age-related changes during cellular aging in vitro, we suggest that treatments which increase \{HSP\} expression should reduce the extent of accumulation of abnormal proteins during aging. Such modulation of aging is an example of hormesis, which is characterized by the beneficial effects resulting from the cellular responses to mild repeated stress. "

abstract = {Several regulatory substances participate in the regulation of both food intake/energy metabolism and reproduction in mammals. Most of these neuropeptides originate and act in the central nervous system, mainly at specific hypothalamic areas. Leptin represents a signal integrating all these functions, but originating from the periphery (adipose tissue) and carrying information mainly to central structures. Observations in rodent models of leptin deficiency have suggested that leptin participates in the control of reproduction, in conjunction with that of food intake and energy expenditure. Indeed, leptin administration resulted in the restoration of normal body weight, food intake, and fertility in the ob mouse, lacking circulating leptin. Specific targets of leptin in the hypothalamus are neurons expressing neuropeptide Y, proopiomelanocortin and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, but the presence of leptin receptors in peripheral reproductive structures suggests that leptin might also act at these sites. Human obesity is often associated with reproductive disturbances. The situation in humans is more complex than in the animal models of leptin deficit and the presence of leptin resistance in these subjects is suggested. In conclusion, leptin fits many requirements for a molecule linking the regulation of energy balance and the control of reproduction. "

In the cement case, the growth of expansive phases has been controlled, along with the set characteristics of the paste, to establish internal stresses which, while significant, have not been sufficient to cause expansive failure. Macro-crack propagation, initiated by external loading, has been suppressed either by the release of residual stresses which act to close the crack or by grain bridging. Because such stresses are dispersed throughout the matrix, this toughening mechanism would add to the value of steel reinforcement in the strengthening of concrete structures. This paper describes some early work concerning the factors which control internal stresses in cement microstructures and the experimentally measured stress–strain and fracture behaviour of pastes and mortars which confirm the dramatic effect of microstructural engineering.

This result is discussed in terms of molecular recognition in the solid state.

abstract = {A variety of donor sites have been reported for the restoration of mid-face cutaneous defects; however, the limited availability of tissue of similar color and texture to that of native facial skin greatly limits reconstructive options. Similarly, resection of the underlying mimetic musculature during the primary ablation compounds this reconstructive challenge, resulting in both a cosmetic and a functional deformity. The combination of the posterior scalping flap for cutaneous resurfacing, and microvascular transfer and reinnervation of the gracilis free flap for dynamic facial reanimation, offers a reconstructive alternative for extensive soft tissue defects of the mid-face.

The main part of the deduced amino acid sequences of the 14.6 kD \{GRP1\} and the larger \{GRP2\} consists of glycine-rich repetitive elements essentially as found for \{GRPs\} in other plants. Tyrosine residues in conserved positions inside these repetitive motifs suggest an involvement of the \{GRPs\} in a polymerization process by oxidative cross-linking, i.e. cell wall fortification. Both \{GRP\} transcripts are induced by infection with A. rabiei, showing a maximum of expression 5 days post infection. Wounding of leaves and the stress of water treatment (performed as a control) also seem to induce the accumulation of \{GRP\} transcripts. "

Different strategies have been developed to file the patient data into scoring systems, primarily to predict the outcome. The Markov simulation—predominantly used in economic science to describe chains of events depending on and influencing each other—seems to be an interesting and new approach in analyzing the course of disease of critically ill patients in an intensive care unit (ICU). Using such a Markov model, this study analyzes data from 660 surgical \{ICU\} patients, 44 of whom died of sepsis. Methods: A three-state Markov model (integrating sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality) was constructed to describe the course of disease of critically ill patients in defined cycles and to develop the risk profile of different groups of patients. The model enables the comparison between age- and sex-related survival rates and shows the difference in life expectancy compared with an average untreated standard population. Results: Women aged up to 30 years (G1F) show the best prognosis (mortality after 19 cycles 8.3%). On the contrary, the corresponding male group (G1M) demonstrates the worst outcome (mortality after 19 cycles 57.7 %). Conclusions: The findings of this study fit into the current discussion that female patients are better positioned to meet the challenge of sepsis. "

Data show that various inhibitors of the \{PLA2\} cascade markedly inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α release, supporting a key role of this pathway in the regulation of microglial activation. We also investigated the putative effects of cGMP-elevating agents on blocking microglial activation induced by LPS. Data show that each member of this class of cGMP-elevating compounds that we employed opposed microglial TNF-α release, suggesting that strengthening intracellular cGMP signaling mitigates against microglial activation.

In this paper we discuss two ways of describing the work context of documents: process modelling and life cycle modelling. In process modelling, documents are regarded as resources produced and used in inter- or intra-organizational business processes. Different types of documents are typically produced and used in a business process. In life cycle modelling work related to processing of a document of a specific type is described. The modelling methods have been tested in an \{SGML\} standardization project called \{RASKE\} during the analysis of four case domains: the enquiry process in the Finnish Parliament and Government, national Finnish legislative work, budgetary work, and the Finnish participation in \{EU\} legislative work. This paper discusses the modelling requirements in document analysis and describes the techniques used in the \{RASKE\} project. "

Physiological cell death typically occurs by apoptosis, as opposed to necrosis. Defects in apoptotic cell-death regulation contribute to many diseases, including disorders associated with cell accumulation (e.g. cancer, autoimmunity, inflammation and restenosis) or where cell loss occurs (e.g. stroke, heart failure, neurodegeneration, \{AIDS\} and osteoporosis). At the center of the apoptosis machinery is a family of intracellular proteases, known as ‘caspases’, that are responsible directly or indirectly for the morphological and biochemical events that characterize apoptosis. Multiple positive and negative regulators of these cell-death proteases have been discovered in the genomes of mammals, amphibians, insects, nematodes, and other animal species, as well as a variety of animal viruses. Inputs from signal-transduction pathways into the core of the cell-death machinery have also been identified, demonstrating ways of linking environmental stimuli to cell-death responses or cell-survival maintenance. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis has provided important insights into the causes of multiple diseases where aberrant cell-death regulation occurs and has revealed new approaches for identifying small-molecule drugs for more effectively treating these illnesses.

abstract = {Background: The prognosis of upper thoracic esophageal cancer is poor when compared with middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer because the tumor easily infiltrates the respiratory tract and surgical en-bloc resection is difficult. Recently, preoperative chemoradiation therapy has been shown to lead to downstaging of the disease and improve prognosis. But the benefit of this therapy for tumors infiltrating the respiratory tract remains unknown. Study Design: Fifty-six patients with thoracic esophageal cancer infiltrating neighboring organs, but with no hematogeneous metastasis, were given preoperative concurrent chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and cisplatin) and radiation (40 Gy) therapy. When a clinical response was observed, making a curative resection potentially possible, patients were scheduled for esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy. Patient prognosis with respect to the organs infiltrated by the tumors was estimated by calculating survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparing the curves by the log-rank test. Results: The prognosis was significantly poorer for patients with tumors infiltrating the respiratory tract (T) or aorta plus respiratory tract (A + T) than for patients with tumors infiltrating the aorta alone (A) or other organs (Oth) (p &lt; 0.05 for Oth versus T; p &lt; 0.05 for Oth versus A + T; p &lt; 0.0001 for A versus T; p &lt; 0.0001 for A versus A + T by log-rank test). Patients positive for respiratory tract invasion (T, T + A), compared with those negative for respiratory tract invasion (A, Oth), showed a poorer clinical response to chemoradiation (3.0%, 45.5%, 39.4%, and 9.1% versus 4.3%, 82.6%, 4.3%, and 8.7% in complete response (CR), partial response (PR), nonresponse (NC) and progressive disease (PD), respectively, p = 0.0156) and surgical resectability (36.4% vs. 87.0%, p = 0.0003). Histologic effectiveness (8.3%, 50.0%, and 41.7% versus 25.0%, 70.0%, and 5.0% in grade 3, grade 2, and grade 1, respectively, for patients with respiratory tract invasion versus those without it, p = 0.0189) and histologic stages (8.3%, 8.3%, 8.3%, 8.3%, 25.0%, and 41.7% versus 20.0%, 0%, 15.0%, 25.0%, 40.0%, and 0% in pathologic CR, stage I, stage IIA, stage IIB, stage III, and stage IV, respectively, for patients with respiratory tract invasion versus those without it, p = 0.0496) were significantly better in patients negative for respiratory tract invasion; the percentages of patients with lymph node metastasis did not differ significantly between the two groups. Comparison of the recurrence patterns showed that local failure was most common in patients with respiratory tract invasion, and distant failure was the leading cause of recurrence in patients without it. Conclusions: Because the prognosis of patients with thoracic esophageal cancer infiltrating the respiratory tract is extremely poor, partially because of the low local effectiveness of preoperative concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy, caution is needed when deciding on salvage surgery.

While the first group has been extensively studied biochemically, very little is known about nuclear receptors that bind and act as monomers. In this study, we compared the binding and transcriptional behaviour of RORα (NR1F1) and RORβ (NR1F2), two representatives of the subgroup of monomer-binding receptors.

This study sought to examine the regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by these transcription factors. Isolated working rat hearts were divided into six groups: control, 15 min ischemia, 60 min ischemia, 15 min ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion, ischemic stress adaptation by subjecting the hearts to four cyclic episodes to 5 min ischemia, each followed by 10 min of reperfusion, and adaptation followed by 15 min ischemia and 2 h reperfusion. Redox-regulated transcription factors, NFκB and AP-1 and the expression of two anti- and pro-apoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and p53 were determined. The results demonstrated NFκB and AP-1 progressively and steadily increased as a function of the duration of ischemia. In the adapted heart, NFκB binding remained high while AP-1 binding was lowered to almost baseline value. The anti-oxidant gene, Bcl-2 was downregulated in the ischemic/reperfused heart, but upregulated in the preconditioned myocardium. Significant induction of the expression of p53 occurred after ischemia and reperfusion. Apoptotic cells were barely detected in the adapted myocardium which was subjected to the same ischemia/reperfusion protocol. The results demonstrate for the first time differential regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by pro- and anti-apoptotic transcription factors and genes as a function of different durations of ischemia and reperfusion.

Further, the indoor environment in which we spend most of our time has changed dramatically. In order to understand the contribution of pollution and other environmental changes to the development of allergy, we need to understand the biologic processes that underlie allergic immune responses. In the present paper, immune regulatory pathways that control the allergic immune response are delineated. Castor bean dust causes widespread allergic sensitisation. The investigations that made clear the importance of \{CD8\} T cells for the regulation of IgE production were triggered by studies of castor bean allergy.

All the observed processes are fully reversible and accompanied by strong changes in absorption and emission spectra. At pH&lt;1, the stable form is the coloured cationic species (AH+). By increasing pH, AH+ is no longer stable and undergoes structural transformations that at pH&gt;3 lead to the uncoloured trans-chalcone (Ct) as a final product. This transformation occurs through the hemiacetal form (B2) and the cis-chalcone (Cc) isomer. This mixture is relatively inert due to the existence of a kinetic barrier that slows down the thermal isomerisation of Cc to the final Ct form. Ct is photosensitive and can be backconverted by light excitation into Cc which at low pH rapidly gives the AH+ species. In basic solution, two more species were detected, the anionic forms (Cc− and Ct−) of the cis and trans-chalcone. Ct− is a stable, not photosensitive species, whereas Cc− is not stable, being converted into Ct− in the dark. A detailed analysis of the chemical behaviour of 4′-methylflavilium ion from the viewpoint of molecular level device shows that this compound behaves as a multistate/multifunctional system. "

abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that can be induced by a plethora of chemical or physiological compounds, including the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1. The molecule \{TNF\} has a trimeric configuration and thus binds to membrane-bound, cellular receptors to initiate cell death mechanisms and signaling pathways leading to gene induction. Previously, we showed that induced clustering of the intracellular domains of the p55 \{TNF\} receptor, or of their respective ‘death domains’ only, is sufficient to activate the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and several mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. NF-κB is the exclusive transcription factor for induction of the IL-6 gene in response to \{TNF\} and functions as the final trigger to activate a multiprotein complex, a so-called ‘enhanceosome’, at the level of the IL-6 promoter. Furthermore, the enhanceosome displays histone acetylation activity, which turned out to be essential for IL-6 gene activation via NF-κB. However, activation of NF-κB alone is not sufficient for IL-6 gene induction in response to TNF, as inhibition of the coactivated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 \{MAPK\} pathways blocks TNF-mediated gene expression. Nevertheless, the transactivating NF-κB subunit p65 is not a direct target of \{MAPK\} phosphorylation. Thus, we postulated that other components of the enhanceosome complex are sensitive to \{MAPK\} cascades and found that \{MAPK\} activity is unequivocally linked to the histone acetylation capacity of the enhanceosome to stimulate gene expression in response to TNF. In contrast, glucocorticoid repression of TNF-driven IL-6 gene expression does not depend on abrogation of histone acetyltransferase activity, but originates from interference of the liganded glucocorticoid receptor with the contacts between NF-κB p65 and the promoter configuration around the \{TATA\} box.

When they encounter a subendothelial matrix exposed by injury to a vessel, platelets adhere, are activated, and become adhesive for other platelets so that they aggregate. αIIb/β3, a platelet-specific integrin, is largely prominent amongst the adhesion receptors and is essential for platelet aggregation. The ligands for αIIb/β3 are the multivalent adhesive proteins fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. In resting platelets, αIIb/β3 is normally in a low activation state, unable to interact with soluble fibrinogen. Stimulation of platelets with various agonists will induce a conformational change in αIIb/β3 (inside-out signalling), which is then able to bind soluble fibrinogen resulting in the onset of platelet aggregation. However, fibrinogen binding to its membrane receptor is not simply a passive event allowing the formation of intercellular bridges between platelets. Indeed, a complex signalling pathway triggered by integrin ligation and clustering (outside-in signalling) will regulate the extent of irreversible platelet aggregation and clot retraction. Amongst the signalling enzymes activated downstream of αIIb/β3 engagement, phosphoinositide 3-kinase plays an important role in the control of the irreversible phase of aggregation. "

abstract = {Summary In the mammalian and avian brains the predominant astroglial elements are astrocytes, and the distribution of GFAP-immunopositivity is rather uneven, some large brain areas being almost devoid of GFAP-immunopositivity. In these areas however, an intense GFAP-immunopositivity appears following injury. In the teleost brain most of the areas are GFAP-immunopositive and ependymoglia predominates. However, a large area, the layer of the sensory neurons in the vagal lobe, is devoid of GFAP. The question arises, whether the lack of GFAP-immunopositivity in the teleost brain is also due to the repression of the GFAP-production, as in birds and mammals, or due to the lack of cells capable of expressing GFAP. To answer this question, stab wounds were made in the vagal lobe of goldfish, as well as in the tectum, in which moderately dense but highly organized GFAP-immunopositive glia has been detected in intact animals. In the layer of the sensory neurons in the vagal lobe no GFAP-immunopositivity appeared even after lesions had been introduced. In the tectum, a rather slight increase of the intensity of the immunostaining was observed in the glial fibers near the lesions but no typical reactive glia similar to that found in mammals or birds, was observed. The results suggest that a lesion does not provoke GFAP-expression in GFAP-immunonegative brain areas in teleosts, in contrast to what is observed in mammals and birds. "

Different neural structures were tested, from the simple perceptron up to the multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers, and evaluated by means of a validation set. The results have shown excellent predictive capability of the neural networks as regards maximum tensile strength, when the variation range of strength does not exceed 100 MPa. "

This review of the literature on health care research discusses different concepts regarding the quality of care assessment in chronic disease, stresses the need to see things from the patient’s perspective, and provides recommendations to optimize health care research. The two most important conclusions that can be drawn are that: (1) the relationship between quality of health care and quality of life in \{IBD\} is one that is certainly worth studying; and (2) when developing a means to assess patient data on quality of care, it is essential to involve patients from the very start.

The study revealed that HL-60 cells underwent internucleosomal \{DNA\} fragmentation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis after a 9-hr treatment with Hibiscus \{PCA\} (2 mM). Flow cytometric analysis of the \{DNA\} content of cells treated with \{PCA\} for 12 hr showed that the cells were distributed mainly in the hypodiploid phase (apoptotic peak, 46.7%), less in the \{G1\} (34.2%) and S phase (14.0%), and few in the G2/M phase (5.1%). Moreover, \{PCA\} treatment caused an increase in the level of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (RB; 180% of control at the 6-hr time point) and, on the contrary, a decline in hyperphosphorylated RB. A rapid loss of \{RB\} was observed when the treatment period was extended. Further studies showed that Hibiscus \{PCA\} application reduced Bcl-2 protein expression to 47%, and increased Bax protein expression to 181% after 1.5 hr as compared with time 0. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in HL-60 cells delayed the occurrence of Hibiscus PCA-induced apoptosis.

abstract = {Oxidatively modified \{LDL\} mimics several aspects of atherogenesis. In this disease, degradation of the matrix proteins’ network also occurs. By a new morphological ex vivo approach, not requiring sample processing, we explored the relationship between the degradation of matrix protein and oxidatively modified LDL. Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy images of fresh cross-section rings of rat aorta, acquired while the sample was maintained in a glucose- and oxygen-supplemented buffer, showed straight, parallel, thick, long extracellular matrix proteins. Traditional microscopic examination, requiring sample fixation and staining, shows smaller and curved fibers. Instead, we observed curved and broken fibers after a 30-min incubation of aorta with either \{LDL\} containing lipid hydroperoxides, or tert-butyl-hydroperoxide. The adhesion of \{LDL\} to the endothelium and its internalization was directly visualized by using a lipid fluorophore. The damage to aorta matrix proteins induced by \{LDL\} and tert-butyl-hydroperoxide was fully prevented by antioxidants, such as ascorbate or Trolox C, or inhibitors of proteases. The image spectroscopy of the fibers’ autofluorescence (polarization and lifetime) revealed an increased mobility of the fluorescent cross-link in fibers. Damaged matrix proteins were also imaged in aorta samples from apolipoprotein E knock-out mice. Our ex vivo images directly visualized the activation of a fast redox-sensitive proteolytic process in the arterial wall triggered by lipid hydroperoxides in LDL. "

We find that the expected macroscopic behavior with the correct scaling is obtained whenever a mechanism able to transfer the weight from the interior of the silo to the walls in an efficient way is present, i.e., in mean field regime. Deviations from the Janssen law's found in lattice models are due to the absence of this efficient mechanism. We investigate the scaling properties of a stick-slip model recently introduced, and find that relative fluctuations do not disappear for large systems and are of the order of average values. Finally we observe that an exponential local weight distribution at the bottom of the silo is independent of the model considered. "

Most of the reported efficient multicast routing algorithms for real-time applications construct a multicast tree using the Dijkstra's algorithm. However, they require reconstruction of the tree when there are group membership changes or faulty links/nodes in the session. In this paper, a dynamic routing strategy that does not rely on the construction of the multicast tree is presented. It is based on the “clustering technique” and it lends well for \{VLSI\} implementation. The Cluster Unit was implemented using \{VHDL\} and a suitable architecture for the routing strategy has been proposed. Performance evaluations based on software simulations show that the proposed routing strategy performs better than the most widely used multicast routing algorithm when the number of nodes become large. Moreover, performance comparisons based on the \{VHDL\} implementation of the Cluster Unit show that the proposed technique performs significantly better when realised in VLSI. "

In an effort to evaluate the role of apolipoprotein E in the formation of these abnormal structures, we examined the tibialis anterior muscle and the hippocampus of several groups of animals including: (i) apolipoprotein E “knockout” mice which had been whole body irradiated with 1200 rads and bone marrow replenished with apolipoprotein E sufficient marrow; and (ii) three transgenic murine strains that had been genetically engineered to express either human apolipoprotein E2, \{E3\} or \{E4\} protein on an apoE deficient background. The results of this study showed that the presence of murine apolipoprotein E (even in subnormal levels in the serum) in irradiated bone marrow replenished mice and in all three (E2, \{E3\} or E4) human apoE transgenic strains was sufficient to prevent the aggregation of sarcoplasmic tubules in the tibialis anterior type \{II\} muscle fibres. Similarly apolipoprotein E “knockout” bone marrow replenished mice and all three transgenic strains expressing the different human apolipoprotein E alleles reduced the number of the astrocytic inclusions in the hippocampus to levels not significantly different to those observed in control \{C57Bl6J\} animals. The data obtained in this study indicate that neurological and neuromuscular abnormalities found in apoE deficient mice are reversed when apoE protein is replaced in the circulation, either by bone marrow transplantation of normal apoE sufficient marrow, or by gene therapy with the apoE gene, albeit of human origin and irrespective of the allele used.

This result leads to a new concept that the temporal sequence of events is memorized among the asymmetric connections in the network. It was also shown that dynamic neural networks were effectively organized using temporal information. Grouping or isolation for the multi-modal information was performed well by temporal learning processing. These results suggest that temporal information may be an important factor for organizing information processing circuits in the nervous system in addition to spatial information. "

Therefore, the importance of an intact actin cytoskeleton on ATP- and bradykinin-elicited Ca2+ signalling was investigated in cultured rat astrocytes by treatment with cytochalasin D which changes the morphology of the cells from an extended to a rounded shape. Cytochalasin D-treated astrocytes were unable, upon prolonged stimulation with the \{P2Y\} receptor agonist ATP, to generate oscillations of [Ca2+]i which are, however, seen in 54% of untreated control cells. In cytochalasin D-treated cells, the amplitude of the initial Ca2+ response was reduced mainly by disturbing the Ca2+ influx, and, moreover, the total Ca2+ pool which is sensitive to thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid was diminished. Thus, disruption of the cytoskeleton blocks agonist-elicited [Ca2+]i oscillations apparently by reducing the coupling efficiency between intracellular Ca2+ stores and capacitative Ca2+ entry. "

Aldosterone is the principal adrenal steroid controlling Na+ retention in amphibians and mammalians. It acts primarily by increasing the apical Na+ permeability through activation of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). The cellular events mediating the hormonal action are mostly unknown. Early studies have provided evidence that the hormone functions to activate or translocate pre-existing channels by a yet undefined mechanism. In addition, enhanced de novo channel synthesis appears to take place as well. The molecular cloning of the three \{ENaC\} subunits has provided new powerful tools for testing and confirming this hypothesis, as well as for characterizing mechanisms by which \{ENaC\} is regulated. Another important development is the recent identification of several cDNAs corresponding to aldosterone-induced and suppressed mRNAs. The study of these genes and their putative interactions with \{ENaC\} is likely to provide important clues to the mechanisms by which aldosterone controls the apical Na+ permeability of tight epithelia. This article reviews recent developments in the field that may lead to the elucidation of the mechanisms by which the hormone controls Na+ transport. "

First, submandibular glands had a lower basal activity of nitric oxide synthase than sublingual glands and the concentration–response curve for carbachol was bell-shaped in the former but not in sublingual glands. Second, cGMP levels displayed a similar profile to that observed for \{NOS\} activity in both glands. Third, protein kinase C also coupled to muscarinic receptor activation in the glands might have a regulatory effect on nitric oxide production since its activity was higher in basal conditions in submandibular than sublingual glands and it also increased in the presence of the agonist at a concentration that inhibited \{NOS\} activity in submandibular glands. The effects appear to be partly related to the expression of a minor population of \{M1\} receptors in submandibular glands absent in sublingual as determined in binding and signaling experiments with the muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine.

abstract = {In parasites such as Leishmania, the study of molecular events induced in response to heat stress is of immense interest since temperature increase is an integral part of the life cycle. Protein phosphorylation is known to control major steps of proliferation and differentiation in eukaryotic cells. Studies on intracellular signaling systems in protozoa are relatively recent. We have examined the effect of heat shock on the protein phosphorylation status in promastigotes of Leishmania donovani. The patterns of total protein phosphorylation and specific phosphorylation at tyrosine residues were examined using [32P]-orthophosphate labelling of the parasites and immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The major proteins of L. donovani that were phosphorylated at 24°C had apparent molecular weights of 110, 105, 66–68, 55, 36–40 and 20 kDa. Heat shock (from 24 to 37°C) led to a significant decrease in phosphorylation of the majority of phosphoproteins in the virulent promastigotes. On the other hand, the avirulent promastigotes did not show any decrease in protein phosphorylation on exposure to heat stress. Predominant phosphorylation at tyrosine residues was detectable in proteins of putative size 105–110 kDa in both virulent and avirulent parasites. Heat shock led to a reduction in the level of phosphotyrosine in both these proteins in the case of virulent parasites, while no such reduction was detectable in avirulent parasites. Significant modifications in the phosphorylation status of proteins in response to heat stress including that of tyrosine containing proteins, observed exclusively in virulent parasites, suggest that modulation of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation may play a role in signal transduction pathways in the parasite upon heat shock encountered on entering the mammalian host.

abstract = {Some thoughts on training and recruitment of academic teachers and future trends in teaching veterinary parasitology are presented with emphasis on the European situation. It is underlined that research is an indispensable basis for academic teaching. Besides a broad scientific background of the teacher, motivation and teaching methods are also important. Many academic teachers do not receive formal training in teaching methods. In order to improve future education, training of staff members in teaching methods should be promoted. Quality control of teaching and research, already established in many schools, should generally be introduced. Teaching is mostly underestimated in relation to research. Therefore, more weight should be placed on the former both in selecting scientists for the career as academic teachers and in evaluating and ranking departments for their academic activities. In the future veterinary medicine will have to cope with profound changes in the society and the veterinary profession, and the progressing European unification will enhance trends for internationalizing teaching curricula. Therefore, veterinary medicine has to reconsider the teaching subjects and methods and to lay more emphasis on flexibility, skills of problem-solving and self-learning and on training for life-long learning. At present there is an ongoing discussion on the question how to teach veterinary medicine, including veterinary parasitology. There are various options, and some of them are discussed, namely, the disciplinary and the problem-based/organ-focussed approaches. It is concluded that for teaching of veterinary parasitology and related disciplines a combined disciplinary and problem-based approach offers the best chances for fulfilling the requirements of teaching for the future. In the curriculum of undergraduate teaching of veterinary medicine at least 70–90 h should be dedicated to veterinary parasitology using a disciplinary and taxonomic approach. Additional hours are required for instructions on clinical cases in approaches focussed on animal species and/or organ diseases. As there is a need for discussing teaching issues, post-graduate specialization, and continuing education in parasitology and related disciplines on national and international levels, it is recommended to \{WAAVP\} to include regular workshops on teaching in the programmes of the biannual conferences, and to establish a permanent committee which should collect information and submit proposals for improvement of teaching veterinary parasitology.

Intervention(s): Steroidogenic and nonsteroidogenic human \{CL\} cells were isolated by mechanical and enzymatic digestion and density sedimentation. The cells were cultured (75,000 cells per well) for 24 hours either as a crude sample of all \{CL\} cells or as an enriched fraction of steroidogenic \{CL\} cells.

Interferons and interleukin-2 received enormous media and public attention as breakthrough drugs for the treatment of human cancer based on provocative early in vitro and laboratory animal successes; however, subsequent clinical trials with recombinant cytokines demonstrated that orchestrating a patient's immune system to fight an advanced malignancy was a challenging and often baffling process. Despite frequent and severe toxicities in human studies, the occasional dramatic and prolonged response observed in selected patients fueled continued clinical development. Perseverance by clinical investigators and corporate supporters and a willing patient population ultimately resulted in the approval of these agents for a limited range of oncologic applications. Interest in interleukin-12 (IL-12) therapy has also varied since it was identified and cloned a decade ago.17,32,70 Enthusiam for IL-12 in the wake of dramatic anticancer properties demonstrated in rodents subsequently declined after disappointing clinical studies and the widely publicized deaths of several patients participating in trials of recombinant IL-12.5,9,16,56 The accumulating experience provides a foundation for laboratory and clinical studies examining novel approaches for cancer therapy employing IL-12.

In this paper, hepatocyte function was examined on two synthetic \{RGD\} substrates and compared to that on fibronectin (Fn). One is a 2.3 kD \{RGD\} peptide (P-2) containing a single RGD, a short spacer in the middle and an end basic sequence to enhance adsorption. On bacteriological plastic, P-2 induced a rounded cell shape, enhanced differentiated function, and inhibited \{DNA\} synthesis. The other, a 73 kD synthetic \{RGD\} protein Pronectin F (PnF), contains repeating \{RGD\} units interspersed with a structural peptide. PnF induced cell spreading, dedifferentiation, and enhanced \{DNA\} synthesis, similar to Fn. In addition, only P-2 showed distinct differences in cell shape and \{DNA\} synthesis when coated on bacteriological plastic, or on Immulon II™ plastic, both intrinsically non-adhesive to cells. On bacteriologic plates coated with P-2, cells were round and showed diminished \{DNA\} synthesis while on Immulon \{II\} plates, they were spread and showed enhanced \{DNA\} synthesis. These results demonstrate that synthetic \{RGD\} peptides can induce very different hepatocyte function depending on the context in which they are presented to cells. It is likely that the \{RGD\} peptide conformation determines the specificity of cellular response. "

Type \{VII\} collagen is the major collagenous component of anchoring fibrils that are essential for the attachment of the epidermis to the dermis. Gelatinase A (MMP-2) is believed to be necessary for the degradation of type \{VII\} collagen. In this study we have examined the in vivo distribution of type \{VII\} collagen and gelatinase A (Gel A) in the developing human epidermis and its appendages. At 13–15 wk of gestation a marked decrease in type \{VII\} collagen immunoreactivity was seen in the \{BMZ\} surrounding invading appendageal buds; however, type \{VII\} collagen mRNA was strongly expressed in the budding epidermal keratinocytes adjacent to the BMZ. At these stages, Gel A-positive mesenchymal-like cells were found scattered throughout the stroma with numerous Gel A-containing cells in direct contact with the developing appendageal buds. In situ zymography was used to show Gel A-activity in vivo. Gel A-mediated lysis was present at the interface between the appendageal buds and the underlying BMZ. By 20–25 wk of gestational age, immunostaining for type \{VII\} collagen protein was absent from the \{BMZ\} surrounding the distal portion of invading appendageal epithelial cords of both hair follicles and sweat glands. In contrast, type \{VII\} collagen mRNA was present in the basal keratinocytes adjacent to the \{BMZ\} surrounding the distal portion of these invading appendageal epithelial cords. At these stages Gel A-positive cells were present in the stroma directly adjacent to the distal portion of developing appendageal cords that lacked type \{VII\} collagen. In situ zymography showed zones of Gel A-mediated stromal lysis at the distal portion of developing appendageal cords. Interestingly, no differences were seen in the distribution of type \{IV\} collagen in the \{BMZ\} of both budding and resting fetal epidermis. These observations suggest that the absence of type \{VII\} collagen protein correlates directly with the presence of Gel A-activity at the BMZ. Gel A appears to play a major role in appendageal development and contributes to remodeling of the \{BMZ\} during fetal skin morphogenesis. "

The high Lewis/Bronsted sites ratio of Zn-ZSM-11 catalyst determined by pyridine desorption at different temperatures followed by FT-IR spectroscopy, allowed us to suggest that electron-donor–acceptor complex, formed between C2+ species and unoccupied molecular orbital of the zinc species present in the catalyst, favored the interaction of C2+ through carbenium intermediate to activate methane.

The fractures identified in the Kurihashi granodiorite were mainly formed during the early stages of the cooling process. The mineralogical and dating data suggest that almost no new fractures have been generated since 70∼60 Ma ago. The fractures have high-porosity fracture fillings with relatively high sorption values that imply the fractured granitic rock could have a significant retardation capability for contaminant transport through the granite. Monitoring of hydrological and geochemical conditions of groundwater for 10 years showed that even fractured granitic rock close to the drift is not thoroughly oxidized, and there are only negligible changes of hydrological conditions and groundwater geochemistry due to earthquakes. This information is of considerable importance for the practical design of a \{HLW\} repository and to assess any impact of the pre-closure conditions on the post-closure performance of the geological repository. Finally, the results of the study methodology and tools developed help increase confidence in the technical feasibility of geological disposal of \{HLW\} in Japan. "

Excessive production of wear particles can induce the osteolysis and then the loosening of the prosthesis components As a tribological design solution to reduce wear, the applications of compliant artificial cartilage materials have been proposed, in which the soft-elastohydrodynamic lubrication is expected to be effective. In this paper, the simulator tests for walking motion and the simplified reciprocating tests were conducted for sliding of artificial cartilage such as \{PVA\} (polyvinyl alcohol) hydrogel and two kinds of \{SIPN\} (semi-interpenetrating network) hydrogels against metal or ceramic specimen, to examine friction and wear of artificial cartilage materials in thin film mixed or boundary lubrication. In simulator tests under walking condition, the combination of cylindrical femoral component and flat tibial one with \{PVA\} hydrogel layer showed higher wear than concave tibial one. In simulator tests of various artificial cartilage flat specimens lubricated with hyaluronate solution, \{PVA\} hydrogel of high water content showed the lowest friction at the start of the test, but friction gradually increased with running. In contrast, the \{PVA\} hydrogel with low water content exhibited the highest friction throughout testing. \{SIPN\} hydrogel containing polyurethane showed lower friction than \{SIPN\} containing cellulose acetate. In reciprocating tests of the spherical zirconia stationary specimen and the flat reciprocating artificial cartilage at constant load, the interruptive test with 2 s interruption at stroke ends showed larger wear than the continuous reciprocating tests for the same sliding distance. The difference in wear of hydrogel materials was examined by the \{AFM\} (Atomic Force Microscopy) observation at non-contact fluid tapping mode. "

The approach incorporates previous achievements in the area of multiphase reactor network synthesis, with the representation being described in form of a superstructure of genetic reactor/mass exchanger units and multi-purpose separators. The functionalities provided by the synthesis scheme are exploited by stochastic optimisation techniques. In constrast to past methods, the synthesis tool is applicable to general systems involving reaction and separation and is guided by the basic phenomena of reaction mass transfer, and phase equilibria. Implementation of the methodology enables the development of targets and screening procedures that help the engineer to assess the system performance and review promising design options. The steps to generate the superstructure along with its modelling components are explained and two examples illustrate the efficiency of the approach. "

This study discusses how to use the \{GANN\} approach in gait-pattern recognition, and evaluates the complexity and training strategy of the particular classification problem. Both the \{GANN\} and a traditional artificial neural network (ANN) were used to classify the gait patterns of patients with ankle arthrodesis and normal subjects. The \{GANN\} model was able to classify subjects with recognition rates of up to 98.7%. In contrast, the \{ANN\} trained by using all possible predictor variables was only able to classify the subjects with recognition rates of 89.7%. It is suggested that the \{GANN\} model is more suitable to exploit the patient's gait pattern. The value of the neuron output can be used as an index of the difference from normal. By this means, all pathological gait patterns may be presented quantitatively. "

The best detection was provided by network-based systems for old probe and old denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and by host-based systems for Solaris user-to-root (U2R) attacks. The best overall performance would have been provided by a combined system that used both host- and network-based intrusion detection. Detection accuracy was poor for previously unseen, new, stealthy and Windows \{NT\} attacks. Ten of the 58 attack types were completely missed by all systems. Systems missed attacks because signatures for old attacks did not generalize to new attacks, auditing was not available on all hosts, and protocols and \{TCP\} services were not analyzed at all or to the depth required.

Because abnormal glycosylation of serum IgA has been shown in IgA nephropathy, we examined whether VEGF-A and \{NO\} production by mesangial cells (MCs) could be modulated by aberrantly glycosylated (desialylated or degalactosylated) IgA. VEGF-A and \{NO\} synthase (NOS) gene expression were examined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or Northern blot analysis, and VEGF-A peptide, by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and \{NOS\} activity as production of tritium ([3H]) citrulline from [3H] arginine. Semiquantitative densitometric analysis of RT-PCR experiments showed a significant downregulation of VEGF-A messenger \{RNA\} (mRNA) in \{MCs\} incubated with aberrantly glycosylated IgA. This resulted in decreased release of VEGF-A in culture medium (P &lt; 0.01). \{NOS\} activity and inducible \{NOS\} (iNOS) mRNA were enhanced by aberrantly glycosylated IgA (both P &lt; 0.01). No modulation of constitutive \{NOS\} mRNA was found. The depression of the VEGF-A production induced by aberrantly glycosylated IgA was mediated by \{NO\} because it was completely reversed by the \{NOS\} inhibitor, N ω-nitro-l -arginine methyl ester. The \{NO\} donor, sodium nitroprusside, induced a bimodal modulation of VEGF; although low concentrations (0.0001 nmol/L) increased VEGF-A synthesis, greater concentrations (1,000 nmol/L) depressed it. In conclusion, we report negative control of VEGF-A synthesis in \{MCs\} by aberrantly glycosylated IgA, mediated by enhanced iNOS activity. We speculate that both increased iNOS activity and depressed VEGF-A synthesis might have a role in impairing vascular repair and favor sclerosis in IgA nephropathy. "

Although the hyperTG-low \{HDL\} cholesterol dyslipidemia has been associated with an impaired clearance of dietary fat, the contribution of the small, dense \{LDL\} phenotype as an independent predictor of postprandial triglyceride (TG) clearance remains uncertain. We have therefore compared the postprandial \{TG\} response among three subgroups of men characterized by small, intermediate or large \{LDL\} particles in a total sample of 69 men (mean age±SD; 45.1±10.5 years). To identify men with small versus large \{LDL\} particles, the first (LDL peak particle diameter&lt;251.9 Å) and the third (&gt;257.6 Å) tertiles of the distribution of \{LDL\} particle diameters were used as cutoff points. Men with small, dense \{LDL\} particles had the expected fasting dyslipidemic profile (high TG-low \{HDL\} cholesterol levels) compared to men with large, buoyant \{LDL\} particles. The oral lipid tolerance test revealed that men with small, dense \{LDL\} particles had significantly higher total-, large-, and medium-TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) responses to a fatty meal than men with large \{LDL\} particles (P&lt;0.03). In addition, within a subgroup of normolipidemic men (TG&lt;2.3 mmol/l and \{HDL\} cholesterol&gt;0.9 mmol/l), those with small, dense \{LDL\} particles had higher levels of total-, medium- and small-TRL responses compared to men with large, buoyant \{LDL\} particles (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, normotriglyceridemic men with small, dense \{LDL\} had higher levels of small-TRLs measured 8 h after the ingestion of the fat meal (P&lt;0.05) compared to normolipidemic men with large, buoyant \{LDL\} particles. Results of the present study suggest that the dense \{LDL\} phenotype may be an additional fasting marker of an exaggerated postprandial \{TG\} response and of an impaired clearance of TRLs. "

Their positions appear to agree reasonably well with the distributions of waters of hydration found in 38 x-ray and 1 neutron high-resolution structures of this protein. The hydration sites are characterized by an average occupancy and a combination of residence time parameters designed to approximate a distribution of residence times. It appears that although the occupancy and residence times of the majority of sites are rather bulk-like, the residence time distribution is shifted toward the longer components, relative to bulk. The sites with particularly long residence times are located only in the cavities and clefts of the protein. This indicates that other factors, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobicity of underlying protein residues, play a lesser role in determining the residence times of the longest-lived sites. "

Changes occur in the infected erythrocyte due to altered phosphorylation of proteins and to novel interactions between host and parasite proteins, particularly at the membrane skeleton. In erythrocytes, the spectrin based red cell membrane skeleton is linked to the erythrocyte plasma membrane through interactions of ankyrin with spectrin and band 3. Here we report an association between the P. falciparum histidine-rich protein (PfHRP1) and phosphorylated proteolytic fragments of red cell ankyrin. Immunochemical, biochemical and biophysical studies indicate that the 89 kDa band 3 binding domain and the 62 kDa spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin are co-precipitated by mAb 89 against PfHRP1, and that native and recombinant ankyrin fragments bind to the 5′ repeat region of PfHRP1. PfHRP1 is responsible for anchoring the parasite cytoadherence ligand to the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, and this additional interaction with ankyrin would strengthen the ability of PfEMP1 to resist shear stress.

Using a restraint stress paradigm, both normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (SHR) underwent acute (1 h restraint in a perspex tube), chronic (1 h restraint for ten consecutive days) or no restraint (control) stress. Following cessation of restraint, rats were processed by incubating sections of brain stem and kidney with [125I]-HO-LVA (0.03 nM) or [125I]Sar1Ile8-AngiotensinII (0.5 nM), in the presence of \{PD123319\} (10 μM) or losartan (10 μM), to determine the distribution and density of vasopressin V1A, angiotensin \{AT1\} and \{AT2\} receptors, respectively. Analysis of autoradiograms indicated changes in the density of radioligand binding in acutely and chronically-stressed rats, as compared to controls. For example, \{V1A\} binding in the medial nucleus tractus solitarius (SolM) decreased in the \{WKY\} but increased in the SHR. \{AT1\} binding in SolM did not significantly change in the \{WKY\} but decreased in the \{SHR\} with repeated restraint. In kidney slices, \{AT1\} binding decreased with stress in the \{WKY\} (−17%) but increased in \{SHR\} (+10–15%). \{AT2\} binding in the kidney showed a pattern similar to that of \{AT1\} binding in SHR, but not WKY. Graded increases in \{V1A\} binding were measured in kidney medulla and cortex of both strains (+50–60% with chronic restraint). These results suggest that physiological adaptation to restraint is associated with specific changes in V1A, \{AT1\} and \{AT2\} receptor density within brain nuclei and kidney. "

Furthermore, a novel extended hydrogen bonding graph-set has been derived for this molecule in crystalline state. Comparison of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide with 1,3-benzenedicarboxamide, where the intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the pyridine ring in the former has been removed, yields a different intermolecular hydrogen bonded structure in the solid state.

In solution, 1,3-benzenedicarboxamide is shown to maintain a hydrogen bonding pattern that is weaker than that observed with pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide. Replacement of one hydrogen on each carboxamide nitrogen of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide by a methyl group also alters the extended structure to a significant extent.

abstract = {Platelet activation and adhesion to endothelial cells and extracellular matrix proteins are crucial events in the development of arterial cardiovascular diseases. Platelet activation is initiated by stimulation of intracellular signaling cascades, including the p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38 \{MAPK\} pathways, followed by major changes in the platelet cytoskeleton and expression and activation of platelet surface receptors, such as P-selectin (CD62P) and \{CD40\} ligand (CD40L). Activated platelets directly bind to vascular endothelial cells via CD40L/CD40 interactions and induce inflammatory reactions that initiate or aggravate atherosclerotic lesions. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of two known platelet inhibitors—the cAMP-elevating prostaglandin \{E1\} (PG-E1) and the cGMP-elevating sodium nitroprusside (SNP)—on platelet p42 \{MAPK\} and p38 \{MAPK\} activation as well as on surface expression of \{CD62P\} and CD40L. \{MAPK\} activation was analyzed by Western blot experiments using phosphorylation-specific antibodies, and surface \{CD40L\} and \{CD62P\} expression was determined by flow cytometry analysis. PG-E1 and \{SNP\} strongly inhibited p42 and p38 \{MAPK\} phosphorylation as well as \{CD40L\} and \{CD62P\} expression in response to thrombin, a thromboxane \{A2\} analog, and ADP. These data indicate that adenosine and guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinases not only inhibit platelet pathways leading to activation and aggregation, but also those resulting in enhanced surface expression of protein ligands involved in inflammation. Expression of \{CD40L\} and \{CD62P\} was found to be independent of \{MAPK\} activation, since it was not inhibited by specific \{MAPK\} inhibitors. Inhibition of platelet-induced inflammatory responses including CD62P- and CD40L-mediated interaction of platelets with leukocytes and endothelial cells, respectively, is suggested to be an important component of the long-term vasoprotective effects of cyclic nucleotide-elevating prostaglandins and \{NO\} donors.

abstract = {Optimal operation of radial distribution networks with automated compensation and reconfiguration requires the solution of a combinatorial optimisation problem, since the variables are the on/off status of capacitor banks and the open/close status of tie-switches. The solution approaches recently proposed use iterative algorithms such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and tabu search, for which the network needs to be solved in different configurations and at different compensation levels. The aim of this evaluation is that of attributing a quality index to each solution so that all the solutions can be suitably ordered. In an automated network, any configuration can be obtained from another one through a set of elementary moves, each consisting of the change of status of a pair of tie-switches. In the same way, any compensation level can be obtained from another one through a set of elementary moves, each consisting of the change of status of a capacitor bank. Once the most important quantities of the network in the starting configuration are calculated, those in the final configuration can be determined assessing the variations due to the series of elementary operations performed on the network that are necessary to go from the starting configuration to the final one. In the present paper, the expressions for the calculation of power losses and bus voltage variations in a radial network due to an elementary reconfiguration move or an elementary compensation move are developed. These expressions are obtained on the basis of the hypotheses usually valid for distribution networks. They can be easily integrated in any algorithm for optimal reconfiguration and compensation, making easier its implementation and faster the solution attainment. Simplified feeder models for distribution feeders with many loads, have also been developed in order to further reduce computation time. Substitution of all feeders with an equivalent one having only one ending load, together with performing evaluations only for a reduced number of network branches, gives rise to remarkable savings, in terms of computation efforts, growing with the network size and the number of loads.

To investigate whether \{RBL\} is important for predicting the survival of patients with MM, transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the presence of basal lamina or \{RBL\} in biopsy specimens obtained by thoracoscopy from 35 patients. Cox's regression analysis was used to study the relation of these ultrastructural features to survival. Better outcomes were found for patients whose tumors expressed either basal lamina (HR 0.48; 95% CI, 0.09–2.47) or \{RBL\} (HR 0.38; 95% \{CI\} 0.12–1.22) compared with the reference category, where basal lamina or \{RBL\} was not found.

abstract = {In the Arctic tundra, subsurface drainage occurs predominantly through the saturated zone within the layer of peat that mantles the hillslopes. In plan view, the peat cover is fragmented into a network of channels due to the presence of mineral earth hummocks. In cross section, the physical and hydraulic properties of the peat vary with depth and the water transmission characteristics (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) of the upper profile differ distinctly from those of the lower. Water flow through the peat is laminar, therefore the friction factor (f) and the Reynolds number (NR) are inversely related. Average values for the coefficient C of the relation f=C/NR, vary from ∼300 near the surface to ∼14,500 at depth. This large difference in C confirms that the larger-diameter soil pores of the living vegetation and lightly decomposed peat near the surface offer much less resistance to water motion than the finer-grained peat deeper in the profile. Also, the variability suggests that subsurface drainage is strongly affected by the position and thickness of the saturated zone within the peat matrix. A first approximation for a model or simulation of the flow regime may consider a peat profile with depth-varying, resistance properties in respect to subsurface flow. "

The results of \{EST\} database searches and \{GENSCAN\} gene prediction analysis reveal 13 serine protease genes and several pseudogenes in the region. Expression analysis by RT-PCR indicates that most of these protease genes are expressed only in a subset of the 35 different normal tissues that have been examined. Several protease genes expressed in skin show higher expression levels in psoriatic lesion samples than in non-lesional skin samples from the same patient. This suggests that the imbalance of a complex protease cascade in skin may contribute to the pathology of disease. The proteases, excluding the kallikrein genes, share approximately 40% of their sequences suggesting that the serine protease gene cluster on chromosome 19q13 arose from ancient gene duplications. "

abstract = {The Upper Cretaceous limestones of the Sorrento Peninsula are primarily characterized by wackestone/packstone with benthic foraminifers, thaumatoporellaceans and Aeolisaccus sp. and by rudist floatstones. Rudists in growth position are rare; most of them appear toppled and locally oriented but not reworked. In some cases they form small bouquets no more than 30 cm thick. The successions analyzed in the Sorrento Peninsula encompass a variety of facies representative of inner shelf environments in a ramp-like depositional setting. On the basis of lithologic and sedimentologic characteristics and on a qualitative analysis of the biofacies, three major facies associations have been recognized corresponding to: (a) intertidal silty-sand flats and shallow lagoons; (b) subtidal mobile foraminiferal sand sheets; (c) subtidal rudist dwelt sand plain. In the lower part of the successions periodic (more or less prolonged) emersions (subaqueous with fresh/brackish waters or subaerial exposure) are documented. The upper part of each succession lacks any emersion evidence; submarine exposure surfaces are testified by firmground-related features. The periodic influence of high-energy regimes (some storm-related events) is documented by wave- and cross-laminations, \{HCS\} and the lack of fine sediments. Lithofacies are arranged in depositional cycles that may correspond to individual beds. The boundaries of the depositional cycles show evidence of subaerial or submarine exposures. The nature and position of these discontinuity surfaces in the successions provide an important clue to interpretation in terms of both depositional environment and vertical evolution. The increase in thickness of the depositional cycles and the gradual change from peritidal/shallow-subtidal cycles to dominantly subtidal cycles, document an increase in the amount of accommodation space which resulted from a long-term rise in relative sea-level. A detailed study of benthic associations (micro- and macrofauna) has been carried out in order to identify accurately further signs of periodicity contained within the successions as a whole. These Upper Cretaceous limestones are abundantly fossiliferous with only a moderately diverse fauna. There are no significant differences in terms of species, the assemblages simply reflecting differences in abundance of the same species. Taphonomic studies of rudist-rich beds permit seven major shell-bed types to be distinguished. Six main foraminiferal assemblages have been detected, and the distribution and relative abundance of the species have been examined within the environments inferred through facies analysis. The taphonomic data and the foraminiferal assemblage abundance and diversity, have been compared with lithologic and sedimentologic data in order to elucidate their distribution within depositional cycles and throughout the successions. The successions show little up-section changes in lithology and in taxonomic composition of the foraminiferal assemblages. It is therefore difficult to establish a paleoenvironmental trend independent of the rudist shell concentrations, which do change up-section. We noticed an overall increase in thickness and abundance of the shell beds and a shift in types of shell concentration and in taxonomic composition. These characteristics, associated with the upward disappearance of emersion surfaces, the higher frequency of storm and/or wave intercalations, the increase in thickness of the depositional sequences and the gradual change from peritidal/shallow-subtidal cycles to dominantly subtidal cycles, document a general deepening-upward trend. More open water conditions with a depth between fairweather and storm wave-base became established as a result of relative sea-level rise and to a consequent increase in the available accommodation space.

At higher concentrations (100–400 μM) \{ACPD\} switched this form of activity to a second, more complex pattern of activity in which intermittent episodes of theta frequency oscillations predominated (‘theta-mode’ activity; 4–14 Hz). Both patterns of activity were evoked by selective activation of group I mGluRs and, in particular, could be induced by activation of mGluR5 alone using the subtype selective agonist \{CHPG\} (0.5–5 mM). In contrast, activation of group \{II\} mGluRs (DCG IV; 100 μM) produced only burst-mode behaviour whilst activation of group \{III\} mGluRs (L-AP4; 100 μM) did not result in synchronised network activity. Concurrent extra- and intracellular recordings demonstrated that this mGluR-induced theta-mode activity represented the synchronous firing of \{CA3\} pyramidal cells and that it shared a similar temporal signature to that generated by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Furthermore, application of mGluR and mAChR agonists at concentrations sufficient to produce only burst-mode activity when applied individually, produced theta-mode activity when co-applied. These data suggest that the level of activation of different mGluRs and mAChRs crucially determine the pattern of rhythmical network activity generated in the hippocampal \{CA3\} network. These results also indicate that individual receptor subtypes (i.e. mGluR5) can initiate patterns of coherent network activity but that interactions between the cholinergic and glutamatergic transmitter systems may also be important factors in governing the temporal patterning of hippocampal network activity.

Under many circumstances, accurate breakpoint localization is the first step toward the identification of genes involved in translocations and inversions. Some of the genes recently discovered may be rearranged with several partner genes. These promiscuous genes are natural experiments that generate mutants which help to identify the function of genes rearranged in hematopoietic malignancies as well as that of their normal counterparts. The diversity of the genes implicated in leukemogenesis makes their functional study a challenge, but, as recently shown by their role in chromatin remodeling, increasing recognition of cross-talk between many of these genes justifies the development of analyses of leukemia-associated chromosome abnormalities and of their functional consequences.

The balance between neuropeptides that contribute to the control of feeding behavior is profoundly and variously altered in these models, supporting the concept of the existence of several types of obesity. The hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) systems are the networks most studied in relation to energy intake. Both receive information about the nutritional status and the level of energy storage through insulin and leptin signaling mediated by specific receptors located on \{POMC\} and \{NPY\} neurons present predominantly in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). When leptin signaling is defective, through a defect in either the receptor (Zucker fa/fa rat, cp/cp rat, and db/db mouse) or in the peptide itself (ob/ob mouse), the \{NPY\} system is upregulated as shown by mRNA overexpression and increased peptide release, whereas the content and/or release of some inhibitory peptides (neurotensin, cholecystokinin) are diminished. For the \{POMC\} system, there is a complex interaction between the tonic inhibition of food intake exerted by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and the Agouti-related protein at the level of the type 4 melanocortin receptor. The latter peptide is coexpressed with \{NPY\} in the ARC. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the link between food intake and environmental factors. It not only inhibits food intake and prevents weight gain, likely through hypothalamic effects, but also activates the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and therefore contributes to energy storage in adipose tissue. The factors that prod the \{CRF\} system toward the hypothalamic or hypothalamo-pituitary axis system remain to be more clearly defined (comodulators, connections between limbic system and ARC, cellular location, and type of receptors, etc.). The pathways used by all of these neuromodulators include numerous brain areas, but some interest has returned to the classic ones such as the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamic areas because of the recent discovery of some peptides (orexins and melanin-concentrating hormone for the lateral hypothalamus) and receptors (CRF type 2 in the ventromedial hypothalamus). All of these pathways are redundant and function in a coordinated manner and sometimes by the novel expression of a peptide in an unusual area. The importance of such a phenomenon in obesity remains to be determined. Even if single-gene mutations are exceptions in human obesity, the study of genetic animal models of obesity has greatly contributed to the understanding of the regulation of feeding behavior and will allow researchers to develop new drug treatments for obesity that have to be associated with drastic changes in lifestyle (feeding, work habits, and physical activity) for a complete efficiency.

abstract = {Age-related bone loss is thought to be due to impaired osteoblast functions. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have been shown to be important stimulators of bone formation and osteoblast activities in vitro and in vivo. We tested the hypothesis that in vitro osteoblast senescence is associated with changes in components of the IGF-system including IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) and IGFBP-specific proteases. We employed a human diploid osteoblast cell line obtained from trabecular bone explants and that exhibit typical characteristics of in vitro senescence during serial subculturing. Using a non-competitive reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, we found that the constitutive level of IGF-I mRNA decreased progressively to 49.9±4.9% in old osteoblasts as compared to the levels found in the young cells. No age-related change was found in IGF-II steady-state mRNA levels. Changes in \{IGFBPs\} gene expression and protein production were assessed using Northern blot analysis and Western ligand blotting (WLB), respectively. IGFBP-3 mRNA levels decreased to 30% and protein production to 16% in aged osteoblasts as compared to levels found in young cells. We also found age-related decreases in mRNA levels of both IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 to 70% and 60% in aged osteoblasts, respectively, compared to young cells. While IGFBP-5 protein was not detected by WLB, IGFBP-4 protein production showed a biphasic change with 50% decrease in middle-aged cells and a subsequent increase in aged osteoblasts to levels similar to those in young osteoblasts. We found an age-related increase in the immunoreactive levels of IGFBP-4 protease, however, no detectable IGFBP-4 or IGFBP-3 protease activities in conditioned media from osteoblast cultures were observed. Our findings demonstrate that osteoblast aging is associated with impaired production of the stimulatory components of the IGF-system, that may be a mechanism contributing to age-related decline in osteoblast functions.

abstract = {Expression of heat shock proteins 47 and 70 in the peritoneum of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Background Peritoneal sclerosis, characterized by collagen accumulation, is a serious complication in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy. Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) is a collagen-specific molecular chaperon and is closely associated with collagen synthesis. Methods We determined the expression of \{HSP47\} and \{HSP70\} (nonspecific for collagen synthesis) by immunohistochemistry in peritoneal tissues of patients on CAPD. The tissue for collagen III, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and \{CD68\} (a marker for macrophages) were also stained. Thirty-two peritoneal samples were divided into three groups (group A1, 11 patients who had no ultrafiltration loss; group A2, 9 patients who had ultrafiltration loss; and group B, 12 specimens who had end-stage renal disease prior to induction of CAPD. Results In group B, staining for HSP47, HSP70, and collagen \{III\} in peritoneal tissues was faint, and only a few cells were positive for α-SMA and CD68. In contrast, HSP47, HSP70, and collagen \{III\} were expressed in areas of thickened connective tissues in fibrotic peritoneal specimens of \{CAPD\} patients. The expression level of HSP47, HSP70, collagen III, and α-SMA and the number of CD68-positive cells in group \{A2\} were significantly higher than those in groups \{A1\} and B. HSP47/HSP70-positive cells were mesothelial cells, adipocytes, and α-SMA–positive myofibroblasts. Furthermore, the expression level of \{HSP47\} was significantly higher in peritoneal specimens from patients with refractory peritonitis than without it and was significantly higher in patients with more than 60 months of \{CAPD\} therapy than that in patients with less than 60 months of CAPD. Conclusion Our results indicate that \{CAPD\} therapy may induce \{HSPs\} in the peritoneal tissue, and that peritonitis in \{CAPD\} patients may be associated with the progression of peritoneal sclerosis at least through \{HSP47\} expression and chronic macrophage infiltration. Our data also suggest that the progression of peritoneal sclerosis in such patients is associated with deterioration of peritoneal ultrafiltration function. "

abstract = {Background &amp; Aims: Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is observed at early stages of intestinal tumor formation, whereas loss of E-cadherin is usually associated with tumor progression. Because both proteins compete for the binding to β-catenin, an essential component of the Wnt signaling pathway, reduction of E-cadherin levels in an Apc mouse model could influence both tumor initiation and progression. In addition, loss or haploinsufficiency of E-cadherin may affect tumorigenesis by altering its cell-adhesive and associated functions. Methods: Apc1638N mice were bred with animals carrying a targeted E-cadherin knockout mutation. Results: Double heterozygous animals showed a significant 9-fold and 5-fold increase of intestinal and gastric tumor numbers, respectively, compared with Apc1638N animals. The intestinal tumors of both groups showed no significant differences in grading and staging. Loss of heterozygosity analysis at the Apc and E-cadherin loci in both intestinal and gastric Apc+/1638N/E-cad+/− tumors revealed loss of the wild-type Apc allele in most cases, whereas the wild-type E-cadherin allele was always retained. This was supported by a positive, although reduced, staining for E-cadherin of intestinal tumor sections. Conclusions: Introduction of the E-cadherin mutation in Apc1638N animals enhances Apc-driven tumor initiation without clearly affecting tumor progression. \{GASTROENTEROLOGY\} 2000;119:1045-1053 "

In model compounds 3–6, B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculations resulted in preference of equatorial OH-orientation, while higher level (MP4(SDQ)) leads to the opposite result. The axial–equatorial equilibria in the larger biomolecules have been discussed in terms of the additional intramolecular CH/π and OH/π interactions caused by the presence of the CD-ring system. These results clearly demonstrate the necessity of considering the whole molecular structure surrounding the π-system when modeling such flexible compounds, as well as the orientations of polar groups which can significantly contribute to the stability.

Existing \{TR\} algorithms are shown to be unviable for \{ATM\} \{VP\} networks owing to either high complexities or failure dependency among VPs. The goal of the paper is to propose efficient algorithms for the computation of \{TR\} between two \{VP\} terminators by means of variants of path-based and cut-based partition methods which have been effectively used for the computation of \{TR\} in traditional networks. The first variant, called the path-based virtual path reliability (PVPR) algorithm, partitions the search space based on a physical path embedding the shortest route of \{VPs\} from the source terminator to the destination terminator. The second variant, called the cut-based virtual path reliability (CVPR) algorithm, in lieu, performs the partition on the basis of a physical cutset separating the source from the remaining terminators. In both algorithms, each subproblem is recursively processed by means of partition until the source and destination terminators are contracted or disconnected. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to one promising \{TR\} algorithm (called EBRM), both the \{PVPR\} and \{CVPR\} algorithms improve the running time by five orders of magnitude. In particular, the \{CVPR\} outperforms \{EBRM\} more than \{PVPR\} does in terms of computation time. The two algorithms and their promising results consequently facilitate the real-time computation of the reliability or robustness of \{ATM\} \{VP\} networks. "

Furthermore, the relationship of self-recognition to other self-processes, such as self-evaluation and autobiographical retrieval, are not clearly defined. However, data from fMRI, \{ERPs\} and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as well as from split-brain studies and patients with focal lesions, indicate that the prefrontal cortex, with possible right hemisphere lateralization, may be a preferential component in self-recognition. Studies using these methods, as well as PET, have indicated that the self-processes of self-evaluation and autobiographical memory preferentially engage networks within the right fronto-temporal region. Although it is highly improbable that there is a ‘self-recognition’ or ‘self’ center, it appears that there may be a bias for the processing of ‘self’ within the right prefrontal cortex. "

Yet, a theoretical background for systemic analysis of synergisms in metabolic networks is lacking. Based on suitable mathematical models, such a theoretical approach should allow predicting synergisms and analysing what mechanistic features contribute to specific synergisms. This work presents a conceptual framework and formalism that fulfil these purposes. The synergism between perturbations of a pair of parameters is quantified as the difference between the response to the simultaneous perturbation of both parameters and the sum of the individual responses to the perturbations of each parameter. A generalisation measures deviations from multiplicative or power-law behaviour. These deviations were called log-synergisms, as in logarithmic coordinates they are quantified in the same way as the synergisms are in Cartesian coordinates. For small perturbations, synergisms and log-synergisms are approximately proportional to the second derivatives (in Cartesian and logarithmic coordinates, respectively) of the observable to the perturbed parameter(s). These derivatives, here called synergism or log-synergism coefficients, measure how steeply the responses diverge from linearity/additivity or power-law/multiplicativity. The formalism now presented allows evaluating (log-)synergism coefficients for systemic steady-state responses, and relates these coefficients to intrinsic kinetic properties of the underlying processes. A robust homeostasis of metabolite concentrations requires that these have moderate systemic log- and relative-synergism coefficients. "

The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line has been used as the in vitro model system. Treatment with 10 μM \{RA\} induced a marked decrease in \{NPY\} gene expression after as little as 3–6 h of incubation and resulted in its almost complete suppression at 12–24 h and after a 6-day differentiating treatment. The \{NPY\} content in cell extracts and the \{NPY\} secreted and accumulated in the culture medium were also reduced by exposure to 10 μM \{RA\} at 12 and 24 h and at 6 days. Moreover, \{RA\} treatment for 6 days, but not for 24 h, resulted in a marked stimulation of proNPY processing to mature NPY. The presence of negative retinoic acid-response elements in the human \{NPY\} promoter (up to −1078 bp) was excluded by a computer search. When SH-SY5Y cells were treated simultaneously with 20 nM \{TPA\} and 10 μM \{RA\} for 24 h, the marked stimulatory effect of \{TPA\} alone was completely suppressed. These observations suggest that the expression of \{NPY\} in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells is negatively regulated by \{RA\} at the level of gene expression, probably by mechanisms involving the interaction of activated \{RARs\} with transcription factors (such as AP-1).

abstract = {Natural gas, driven by pressure, is transported through pipeline network systems. As the gas flows through the network, energy and pressure are lost due to both friction between the gas and the pipes' inner wall, and heat transfer between the gas and its environment. The lost energy of the gas is periodically restored at the compressor stations which are installed in the network. These compressor stations typically consume about 3–5% of the transported gas. This transportation cost is significant because the amount of gas being transported worldwide is huge. These facts make the problem of how to optimally operate the compressors driving the gas in a pipeline network important. In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the fuel cost incurred by the compressor stations driving the gas in a transmission network under steady-state assumptions. In particular, the decision variables include pressure drops at each node of the network, mass flow rate at each pipeline leg, and the number of units operating within each compressor station. We present a mathematical model of this problem and an in-depth study of the underlying mathematical structure of the compressor stations. Then, based on this study, we propose two model relaxations (one in the compressor domain and another in the fuel cost function) and derive a lower bounding scheme. We also present empirical evidence that shows the effectiveness of the lower bounding scheme. For the small problems, where we were able to find optimal solutions, the proposed lower bound yields a relative optimality gap of around 15–20%. For a larger, more complex instance, it was not possible to find optimal solutions, but we were able to compute lower and upper bounds, finding a large relative gap between the two. We show this wide gap is mainly due to the presence of nonconvexity in the set of feasible solutions, since the proposed relaxations do a very good job of approximating the problem within each individual compressor station. We emphasize that this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time such a procedure (lower bound) has been proposed in over 30 years of research in the natural gas pipeline area "

abstract = {Two process scheduling examples from consumer goods industries are presented. These problems contain several features, which in practice tend to make problems difficult to solve and present barriers to regular use of scheduling technology. Several instances of the main challenge to obtaining a solution, the underlying process physics, are highlighted. Computational issues can be traced to operations being strongly interrelated by resource sharing, inventory constraints, manpower availability, and management policies. The question of what defines optimality arises when demands, process rates, yields, and batch cycle times are variable over time. Ultimately, it becomes necessary to tradeoff between optimality with respect to a given set of process parameter estimates and robustness to a set of realistic scenarios. Although the examples presented are relatively concise due to simplifying assumptions, implementation and representation of large problems are themselves challenges. If an enormous amount of resources are required to build and maintain models, even the highest quality methodology is in trouble. "

An infrastructure includes the sources, networks and sinks in transportation of people and goods, telecommunications, energy, water, and waste. The problems encountered in the design of these infrastures are similar to the selection of unit operations, optimization of plant operations, connectivity of the process units, facility layout, and finally process intensification. Overall, we will demonstrate the manner in which the design of an infrastructure can be formulated and potentially solved by the current methods employed in \{PSE\} and the chemical process industry. The design and operation of infrastructured hence provide an extensive new area of research for process systems engineers. "

The present investigation, therefore, analyses the coexpression and function of different growth factors and their receptors in the human \{ES\} cell line GRU-1 and its clonal subpopulations (GRU-1A, GRU-1B and GRU-1C). As shown by Northern blot, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and \{MTT\} assay, all \{ES\} cell lines expressed transforming growth factor (TGF)-α and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). Although no response to exogenous TGF-α was observed, antagonistic anti-EGF-R antibodies (at 20 μg/ml) induced significant (P&lt;0.05) growth inhibition in all cell lines. All cell lines showed coexpression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A and the corresponding receptors. Neutralisation of ES-derived \{PDGF\} by anti-hPDGF antibodies resulted in significant (P&lt;0.05) growth inhibition of all clonal subpopulations. Although all cell lines expressed TGF-β1 as well as TGF-β type I and type \{II\} receptors (TGF-BI-R and TGF-BII-R), growth inhibition (P&lt;0.05) by exogenous TGF-β1 was achieved in the clonal subpopulations only and not in the parental cell line. No \{ES\} cell line expressed acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) but stimulation of \{FGF\} type 3 and type 4 receptors (FGF-3R and FGF-4R) by exogenous acidic \{FGF\} (aFGF) resulted in a marked (P&lt;0.05) acceleration of proliferation in all cell lines. In conclusion, our investigation suggests an intricate network of autocrine, juxtacrine and paracrine signalling between \{ES\} tumour cells and adjacent non-neoplastic stromal cells. "

Design Retrospective noncomparative case series. Participants: One hundred and ninety-five patients with VKC. Methods Clinical evaluation and outcome in 151 of 195 patients with a median followup of 47 months. Evaluation was by telephone survey in 69 patients. Main outcome measures (1) Demographic, clinical, and immunologic features of \{VKC\} and their influence on the course of the disease; (2) conjunctival and corneal complications and efficacy of treatment observed during the followup period. Results \{VKC\} is a chronic disease. More than 60% of patients had repeated recurrences all year round. Males had an earlier presentation of symptoms than females and the male/female ratio decreased with age. Major (greater than 80%) and minor (up to 80%) diagnostic criteria were defined for clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. Negative skin test or radioallergosorbent test was present in approximately 50% of patients, whereas eosinophil infiltration was a constant histopathologic finding. A marked conjunctival sensitivity to nonspecific stimuli was noted in more than one third of patients. In 6% of cases, a reduction of visual acuity resulted from corneal scarring, and in 2% of patients, steroid-induced glaucoma was observed. The large size of giant papillae indicates poor prognosis for the persistence of the disease and its evolution into a chronic, perennial condition. Conclusions: \{VKC\} is a chronic eosinophilic disease of the ocular surface involving IgE, non IgE-mediated mechanisms, and age-sex–related influences. Although the disease has a good prognosis, severe visual impairments may result from long-standing inflammation. "

PyH2 undergoes a two-electron oxidation process involving two consecutive one-electron releases, the latter requiring potentials much less positive than the former. The overall process occurs through a primary one-electron step accompanied by a fast proton release, with the formation of a neutral radical (PyH·), which undergoes a further and quite easier one-electron step, thus providing the main ultimate product (PyH+) consisting in the protonated form of the parent pyridine derivative. This appears relevant for the anti-oxidant effect since the radical intermediate is much more prone to be oxidized than to be reduced, thus preventing the propagation of the oxidative chain reaction. The mentioned release of protons in the primary electrode step causes the overall process to be complicated by a parassite side reaction involving the coupling between one of the electrode products (H+) and the starting species. The protonation of PyH2 subtracts part of the original species from the electrode process because the parent cationic species (PyH3+) is no longer electroactive. This parassite reaction occurs rather slowly in the timescale of electroanalytical measurements (the relevant kinetic constant has been estimated to be 6.4 l mol−1 s−1), thus markedly affecting the process only in the presence of relatively high PyH2 concentrations and progressively decreasing with the starting PyH2 concentration. All the products formed in the oxidation process (PyH+, H+ and PyH3+) have been identified by voltammetric evidences based on deep investigations on their cathodic behaviour. The advantageous anti-oxidant properties displayed by PyH2 with respect to those exhibited by phenolic anti-oxidants such as vitamin E are also discussed. "

There have been many studies on the cytokine pattern to evaluate abnormalities of immune cells in AD, but the results were conflicting and most of these previous reports were performed with various mitogen-stimulation. Objective The purpose was to investigate de novo cytokine pattern in \{AD\} peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We focused on the expression of cytokines that have effects on monocytes and T cells. Methods We measured mRNA expression of IL-10, GM-CSF, TGF-β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in freshly isolated \{PBMC\} with semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The intensity of cytokine cDNA were normalized to that of β-actin product as a standard marker. Results Interleukin-10 mRNA expression was significantly enhanced in \{AD\} compared with control subjects (P &lt; .05). Spontaneous mRNA expression of TGF-β and TNF-α was significantly lower in \{AD\} patients (P &lt; .01). The level of GM-CSF mRNA expression was heterogenous and spontaneous mRNA expression was slightly increased in \{AD\} although the difference didn't reach the statistical significance. Interleukin-6 mRNA was not detected in most of \{AD\} and controls. Conclusion Our data could represent in vivo cytokine expression state associated with monocytes and other immune cells. Increased expression of IL-10 and GM-CSF may be associated with monocyte dysfunction in \{AD\} although increase in the expression of GM-CSF mRNA was not statistically significant. Inhibitory effect of increased IL-10 was suggested on decreased expression of TNF-α mRNA. The role of TGF-β in \{AD\} remains to be seen. "

For single β-lactoglobulin, it was found that the gelation temperature and the storage modulus of the gels were strongly pH-dependent. However, the rheological behaviour was almost the same; the β-lactoglobulin gels were formed upon first heating from 45 to 90°C, reinforced on cooling to 20°C, and then weakened during reheating steps to 70°C. Single κ-carrageenan systems showed also the same behaviour over pH 4–7; gelation occurred at temperatures below 25°C and the melting took place on reheating above 40°C. In contrast, over this pH range, mixed systems showed two distinct types of behaviour: one over pH 5–7 and the other at pH 4.0. Over pH 5–7, the behaviour of β-lactoglobulin and κ-carrageenan, upon gel formation and melting, can easily be identified in that of the mixed systems, thus suggesting that phase-separated gels were formed. While at pH 4.0, the mixed gel showed a peculiar behaviour, similar to that of the pure protein gel. The presence of κ-carrageenan is only evidenced by the significant enhancement of the protein gel strengths. At this pH, below the protein pI, the electrostatic attractive forces between β-lactoglobulin and κ-carrageenan are important. Therefore, these two biopolymers associated and then formed a mixed gel, with one continuous network structures, similar to that of complex coacervate networks. "

The deterministic user equilibrium (UE), stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) and system optimum (SO) models have been studied extensively in the literature. The relationship between the \{UE\} solution and the \{SO\} solution for a given network is well known, as is the relationship between \{UE\} and SUE. The question that arises concerns the relationship between \{SUE\} and (deterministic) SO. The flow pattern obtained from the \{SO\} solution serves as a yardstick for comparison with the flow patterns obtained from the \{UE\} and \{SUE\} solutions. The investigation examines whether the stochastic equilibrium is “closer” than the deterministic user equilibrium to the system optimum. This paper compares the performance of the different solutions for simple networks. The comparison is made by evaluating the relative difference in total system times for \{UE\} and \{SUE\} solutions with respect to the \{SO\} solution. This paper also presents an extension of previous results to show that the Braess’ paradox can occur for certain ranges of demand volumes in the case of stochastic equilibrium and non-linear cost functions.

Seventeen clones of interest were isolated and sequence analysis revealed that one of these clones encoded a putative transmembrane protein, rhombencephalic expression protein-40 kDa (Rhombex-40). The rat Rhombex-40 was composed of 374 amino acid residues and the predicted secondary structure displays a signal peptide in the N-terminus and single-pass transmembrane domain in the center of the sequence. An analysis of consensus sequences identified several phosphorylation sites in the intracellular domain. Expression of rat Rhombex-40 mRNA is high in the brain and low in lung, liver and kidney. No homologous protein sequence was found in database searches. Whereas the biological function of this protein is presently unknown, its structural features and high expression in the brain suggest that Rhombex-40 may function as a novel transmembrane molecule in neural cells of the brain.

Few data have been generated regarding the factors associated with successful patient adjustment. Depression and perception of the effects of illness are important responses to the experience of \{ESRD\} and may be associated with differential survival. Perception and extent of social support can moderate these factors. The association of psychosocial factors and assessments of quality of life are incompletely understood and are topics of research interest. The role of variation in socioeconomic status in association with these factors has not been extensively studied. The challenges for the next 30 years include understanding the relationship of psychosocial factors to demographic and medical factors in large \{ESRD\} patient populations and the refinement of associations between psychosocial factors and patient outcomes, including adjustment, compliance, morbidity, and mortality.

It was shown that \{L1\} proteins from some bacteria and archaea are functionally interchangeable within the ribosome and in the repression of translation. The crystal structure of bacterial \{L1\} from Thermus thermophilus (TthL1) has previously been determined. Results: We report here the first structure of a ribosomal protein from archaea, \{L1\} from Methanococcus jannaschii (MjaL1). The overall shape of the two-domain molecule differs dramatically from that of its bacterial counterpart (TthL1) because of the different relative orientations of the domains. Two strictly conserved regions of the amino acid sequence, each belonging to one of the domains and positioned close to each other in the interdomain cavity of TthL1, are separated by about 25 Å in MjaL1 owing to a significant opening of the structure. These regions are structurally highly conserved and are proposed to be the specific RNA-binding sites. Conclusions: The unusually high RNA-binding affinity of MjaL1 might be explained by the exposure of its highly conserved regions. The open conformation of MjaL1 is strongly stabilized by nonconserved interdomain interactions and suggests that the closed conformations of \{L1\} (as in TthL1) open upon \{RNA\} binding. Comparison of the two \{L1\} protein structures reveals a high conformational variability of this ribosomal protein. Determination of the MjaL1 structure offers an additional variant for fitting the \{L1\} protein into electron-density maps of the 50S ribosomal subunit. "

The interaction of adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) has been known to be profoundly involved in the trafficking of lymphocytes into the inflammatory tissues. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of VLA-4 or VCAM-1 in the development of GVHR-induced hepatic lesions in our model. Methods: \{B6\} T spleen cells were injected into (B6.C-H-2bm12×B6) \{F1\} mice intravenously. Anti-VLA-4 mAbs and/or anti-VCAM-1 mAbs were injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg of each mAbs per body weight of mouse. We examined the changes in GVHR-induced hepatic lesions, serum levels of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and cytokine mRNA expressions of liver-infiltrating lymphocytes using H.E. and immunohistochemical staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and reverse transcription-poly-merase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Results: Hepatic lesions of anti-VLA-4 mAbs-treated mice were inhibited compared with those of \{GVHR\} mice. However, the administration of mAbs did not interfere with the induction of splenomegaly, the invasion of CD4+, CD8+, B220+, or Mac-1+ cells around bile ducts, nor the production of AMA. Liver-infiltrating CD4+ T cells obtained from these treated mice did not alter the expression of T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokine mRNA. Conclusion: The results suggest that treatment with antibodies against these adhesion molecules could inhibit the infiltration of lymphocytes without affecting the Th1/Th2 balance. The blockade of VLA-4-mediated cell infiltration into the liver in this model may have a possible novel therapeutic role of VLA-4 mAbs. "

Both unprimed and primed animals developed IgG aAb to IL-1α. These aAb persisted at high levels more than 100 days after vaccination and did not cross-react with murine IL-1β. The induced anti-IL-1α aAb inhibited binding of IL-1α to the murine T-cell line NOB-1 by simple competition and neutralised IL-1α, but not IL-1β-induced IL-6 in vivo. The aAb did not induce visible discomfort in the animals. In conclusion, long-lasting and high levels of neutralising and specific IgG aAb to IL-1α can be induced in mice by vaccination with recombinant murine IL-1α conjugated to PPD.

The simplicity and regularity of this motif have made it an attractive system to explore some of the fundamental principles of protein folding and stability and to test the principles of de novo design. Results: The X-ray crystal structure of the 18-heptad-repeat α-helical coiled-coil domain of the actin-bundling protein cortexillin I from Dictyostelium discoideum is a tightly packed parallel two-stranded α-helical coiled coil. It harbors a distinct 14-residue sequence motif that is essential for coiled-coil formation, and is a prerequisite for the assembly of cortexillin I. The atomic structure reveals novel types of ionic coiled-coil interactions. In particular, the structure shows that a characteristic interhelical and intrahelical salt-bridge pattern, in combination with the hydrophobic interactions occurring at the dimer interface, is the key structural feature of its coiled-coil trigger site. Conclusions: The knowledge gained from the structure could be used in the de novo design of α-helical coiled coils for applications such as two-stage drug targeting and delivery systems, and in the design of coiled coils as templates for combinatorial helical libraries in drug discovery and as synthetic carrier molecules.

However, not much is known about the relationship between the production of \{MMP\} and the progression of atherosclerosis. Purpose and method: To demonstrate the association between the protein-tyrosine phosphorylation (PTP) and the activation of extracellular \{MMP\} in the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vanadate (an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatase and an activator of certain protein-tyrosine kinases) on mitogenesis ([3H]thymidine incorporation after 24 hours), migration, \{PTP\} (Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies), and production of \{MMP\} (gelatin zymography) was examined in cultured VSMCs. Results: Both vanadate (1–5 μmol/l) and \{PDGF\} (1–10 ng/ml) caused a dose-dependent increase in thymidine incorporation and migration and produced 72-kDa type \{IV\} gelatinase (MMP-2) in VSMCs. The combination of vanadate and \{PDGF\} resulted in a dose-dependent synergistic effect on thymidine incorporation and MMP-2 production. Western blot analysis revealed that \{PDGF\} caused an increase in PTP, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1, ERK2) and \{PDGF\} receptor in VSMCs. Vanadate given together with \{PDGF\} induced a marked increase in the intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation in these proteins. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and herbimycin A) and a synthetic inhibitor of \{MMP\} (1,10-phenanthroline) and an anti-MMP-2 neutralizing antibody inhibited the mitogenic effect induced by vanadate and/or PDGF. Conclusions: The data suggest that the proliferation and migration of cultured \{VSMCs\} was closely related to the stimulation of MMP-2 production that was induced through activation of PTK. "

To examine the hypothesis that nifedipine induces cell death and modulates calcium-induced apoptosis, cardiomyocytes in culture from embryonic chick hearts, that readily manifest apoptosis, were studied. Apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and by quantitative analysis of \{DNA\} fragmentation by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for histone-associated \{DNA\} fragments of mono- and oligonucleosome size. Cell death was evaluated by using the \{MTT\} (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Cardiomyocytes were treated with various concentrations of nifedipine over a concentration range relevant to serum concentrations in man. Nifedipine, 1 to 100 μM, did not produce cell death in cardiomyocytes. There was no evidence of apoptosis on \{FACS\} analysis of cardiomyocytes stained with fluoresceine diacetate or propidum iodide (PI). Neither was there any evidence of apoptotic nuclei on \{PI\} staining of permeabilized cardiomyocytes treated with nifedipine. In contrast, \{DNA\} fragmentation consistent with apoptosis was induced in a significant (P&lt;0.05) concentration-dependent manner, by increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o). Importantly, nifedipine reduced \{DNA\} fragmentation produced by increased [Ca2+]o. Furthermore, nifedipine blocked calcium-induced cell death as high [Ca2+]o significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced cell viability. These data indicate that nifedipine does not induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes rather apoptosis in cardiomyocytes is under regulatory control by Ca2+ and nifedipine can antagonize Ca2+-mediated apoptotic cell death.

abstract = {The brown spider, genus Loxosceles, is becoming of great medical importance, with envenomation (Loxoscelism) occurring throughout the world. The biological activities of the brown spider venom usually include dermonecrotic lesions at the bite site accompanied by hemolytic and haemorrhagic effects and also by renal failure. The objective of the present study was to describe the histology of the venom gland of L. intermedia using glands from adult spiders which were investigated by light microscopy, using immunohistochemical and staining methods, by transmission electron microscopy, and by scanning electron microscopy. The organization of the venom gland of Loxosceles intermedia follows the general architecture of spiders' venom glands. Using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy we observed that the venom glands of L. intermedia present two layers of striated muscle fibers, an external layer and an internal layer in touch with an extracellular matrix which is a basement membrane structure and a fibrillar collagen matrix separating the muscular region from epithelial cells of the venom gland. Muscle cells are multinucleated, with nuclei peripherally placed and their cytoplasm rich in sarcoplasmic reticulum, myofibrills and continuous Z lines. By using scanning electron microscopy we can detect muscular cells from external layer as branching cells. Epithelial cells have their cytosol extremely rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria collection, Golgi apparatus, interdigitating membranes and secretory vesicles that ultimately accumulate the venom, a complex protein mixture.

abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which emulate the parallel distributed processing of the human nervous system, have proven to be very successful in dealing with complicated problems, such as function approximation and pattern recognition. Due to their powerful capability and functionality, \{ANNs\} provide an alternative approach for many engineering problems that are difficult to solve by conventional approaches. Rainfall forecasting has been a difficult subject in hydrology due to the complexity of the physical processes involved and the variability of rainfall in space and time. In this study, \{ANNs\} were adopted to forecast short-term rainfall for an urban catchment. The \{ANNs\} were trained to recognise historical rainfall patterns as recorded from a number of gauges in the study catchment for reproduction of relevant patterns for new rainstorm events. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of temporal and spatial information on short-term rainfall forecasting. To achieve this aim, a comparison test on the forecast accuracy was made among the \{ANNs\} configured with different orders of lag and different numbers of spatial inputs. In developing the \{ANNs\} with alternative configurations, the \{ANNs\} were trained to an optimal level to achieve good generalisation of data. It was found in this study that the \{ANNs\} provided the most accurate predictions when an optimum number of spatial inputs was included into the network, and that the network with lower lag consistently produced better performance.

In this study, we cloned and determined the entire beluga whale IL-6-encoding cDNA sequence by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sequencing, and analysed its genetic relationship with those from several mammalian species including human, rodent, ruminant, carnivore and other marine species. The identity levels of beluga whale IL-6 nucleic and deduced amino acid sequences with those from these mammalian species ranged from 62.3 to 97.3%, and 42.9 to 95.6%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences showed that the beluga whale IL-6 was most closely related to that of the killer whale. Thereafter, beluga whale IL-6-encoding sequence was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli by using the pTHIOHisA expression vector for the production of a recombinant fusion protein. The immunogenicity of the recombinant fusion protein was then confirmed as determined by the production of a beluga whale IL-6-specific rabbit antiserum. "

Dual tasks have also attracted some interest because they are said to be prototypical executive tasks. Executive functions is a concept often used to denote functions of attentional control, such as switching or dividing of attention, inhibition, planning, coordination, and decision making. It is, however, probably more fruitful to consider these diverse functions separately, rather than referring to executive function as a single entity. The results of increasing information processing demands is somewhat similar in both \{WM\} tasks and dual tasks, with a quantitative increase in activity in several areas, often most pronounced in the inferior and middle frontal gyms, particularly in the right hemisphere.

Models are discussed that account for the generation of such organizing regions. The generation of local high concentrations of signalling substances was proposed to depend on local self-enhancement combined with a long-range inhibition. The model accounts for pattern regulation, for instance, for the formation of multiple embryos after fragmentation of the early blastodisc in chickens or for head regeneration in the fresh water polyp Hydra. The model has found support from more recently discovered interactions involved in organizer formation. The mutual down-regulation of noggin/chordin and BMP-4 is proposed to function as an indirect self-enhancement, establishing in this way an essential prerequisite for primary pattern formation. Self-enhancement and long-range inhibition is also crucial for the generation of substructures such as bristles or tracheae. A poisoning of an organizing region by a second antagonistic reaction of a short range but a long time constant can lead to its displacement. Long extended structures can be formed as a trace behind the moving organizer. The notochord and the tracheae of insects are discussed as examples. "

To this aim the frequency and duration of rearing episodes in a novelty situation, which is thought to monitor NSA, have been measured in male \{SHR\} and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats following subchronic treatment with methylphenidate (MP; 3 mg/kg) or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-Nitro-arginine-methylester (l-NAME; 1 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for two weeks. Different groups were tested at 0.5 h or 24 h after the last injection in a Làt-maze. Tests were repeated twice at a 24 h interval and lasted 10 min each. Upon first exposure, there was a differential drug effect only in the SHR. In fact, \{MP\} and l-NAME yielded a shift to the left and to the right, i.e. towards episodes of lower or higher duration, respectively. This shift was more pronounced in the group tested 0.5 h after the last injection. In contrast, both drugs produced a significant lengthening of the rearing episodes in the \{SHR\} only in comparison with the vehicle-treated rats over days of testing. Therefore both \{MP\} and l-NAME appear to shear a similar effect on non-selective attention, although the effect of l-NAME is somewhat paradoxical. The latter is likely to be due to increased arginine selective uptake due to negative feedback with the \{NO\} production. The consequent increased arginine availability displaces the \{NOS\} inhibitor, thus leading to increased \{NO\} production. In conclusion, dopamine and nitric oxide play a role in non-selective attention by synaptic and extrasynaptic mechanisms, respectively, in a rat model of hyperactivity and attention-deficits. "

The enzyme functions through three distinct active centers carrying out L-glutamine hydrolysis, conversion of 2-oxoglutarate into L-glutamate, and electron uptake from an electron donor. Results: The 3.0 Å crystal structure of the dimeric 324 kDa core protein of a bacterial glutamate synthase was solved by the \{MAD\} method, using the very weak anomalous signal of the two 3Fe-4S clusters present in the asymmetric unit. The 1472 amino acids of the monomer fold into a four-domain architecture. The two catalytic domains have canonical Ntn-amidotransferase and \{FMN\} binding (β/α)8 barrel folds, respectively. The other two domains have an unusual “cut (β/α)8 barrel” topology and an unexpected novel β-helix structure. Channeling of the ammonia intermediate is brought about by an internal tunnel of 31 Å length, which runs from the site of L-glutamine hydrolysis to the site of L-glutamate synthesis. Conclusions: The outstanding property of glutamate synthase is the ability to coordinate the activity of its various functional sites to avoid wasteful consumption of L-glutamine. The structure reveals two polypeptide segments that connect the catalytic centers and embed the ammonia tunnel, thus being ideally suited to function in interdomain signaling. Depending on the enzyme redox and ligation states, these signal-transducing elements may affect the active site geometry and control ammonia diffusion through a gating mechanism. "

In contrast, the biological significance of protein-tyrosine phosphoryl ation in bacteria, which has only been recognised recently, is still unclear. Here, we have analysed the role in Escherichia coli cells of an autophosphorylating protein-tyrosine kinase, Wzc, and a phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase, Wzb, by performing knock-out experiments on the corresponding genes, wzc and wzb, and looking at the metabolic consequences induced. The results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Wzc, as regulated by Wzb, is directly connected with the production of a particular capsular polysaccharide, colanic acid. Thus, when Wzc is phosphorylated on tyrosine, no colanic acid is synthesised by bacteria, but when dephosphorylated by Wzb, colanic acid is produced. This process is rather specific to the pair of proteins Wzc/Wzb. Indeed, a much lesser effect, if any, on colanic acid synthesis is observed when knock-out experiments are performed on another pair of genes, etk and etp, which also encode respectively a protein-tyrosine kinase, Etk, and a phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase, Etp, in E. coli. In addition, the analysis of the phosphorylation reaction at the molecular level reveals differences between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, namely in the number of protein components required for this reaction to occur.

abstract = {Although acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is commonly considered to be a childhood disease, \{ALL\} has a second incidence peak at around age 50 years and steadily increases in incidence with age. The last 3 decades have seen significant advances in the treatment of children with ALL. Complete remission rates are well over 90%, and long-term disease-free survival is achieved in 70% to 80% of the patients.103 In contrast, adults fare much worse. Although complete remission rates approach those in children, only 30% to 40% of adults with \{ALL\} can expect a cure.58 How can these differences be explained? Many factors have been suggested: higher age and associated comorbidities, decreased tolerance to dose intensity of chemotherapy in older patients, different mechanisms of drug resistance and sensitivity to steroids, unfavorable distribution of prognostic factors in adults (e.g., immunophenotype, elevation of the white blood cell count, response to induction therapy, cytogenetic markers). Although some of these factors may be responsible for the more unfavorable outcome in adults, most of these links are weak and lack independent prognostic significance. Recent discoveries of cytogenetic–molecular abnormalities in patients with \{ALL\} and their effect on other facets of \{ALL\} leukemogenesis, such as regulation of cell cycle progression and programmed cell death (apoptosis), intracellular signaling pathways, or the role of angiogenesis, suggest that adult \{ALL\} may vary in many aspects from the disease in children. Understanding these differences may help in designing new therapeutic approaches for adults with \{ALL\} and may also help in identifying children with \{ALL\} who are at high-risk by current prognostic models and who have an outcome similarly dismal to that of most adult patients.31 This article discusses some of the recently described molecular abnormalities in \{ALL\} and speculates on their relevance, their effect on future prognostic models, and their influence in the design of new therapeutic approaches for this disease.

The framework is a set of professional attributes which underpin the delivery of an inter-disciplinary postgraduate course in the United Kingdom (UK). It enables students to review and develop knowledge and skills required to lead and advance nursing and health care practice. The framework is reviewed in relation to \{UK\} policy discussion on advanced or higher levels of practice. Brief comparisons are made with international concepts and literature on advanced nursing practice. The potential contribution of this framework to nursing practice and education is discussed. In particular, the framework provides a degree of clarity and coherence in specifying the nature and scope of advanced and higher level practice in the UK. "

The predicted amnesiac gene product, AMN, is an apparent preproneuropeptide, and previous studies suggest that it stimulates cAMP synthesis. Here we show that, unlike other learning-related Drosophila proteins, \{AMN\} is not preferentially expressed in mushroom bodies. Instead, it is strongly expressed in two large neurons that project over all the lobes of the mushroom bodies, a finding that suggests a modulatory role for \{AMN\} in memory formation. Genetically engineered blockade of vesicle recycling in these cells abbreviates memory as in the amnesiac mutant. Moreover, restoration of amn gene expression to these cells reestablishes normal olfactory memory in an amn deletion background. These results indicate that \{AMN\} neuropeptide release onto the mushroom bodies is critical for normal olfactory memory. "

If the retardation coefficients of these species are not the same, product species will either be delayed or displaced forward relative to the reactants. A novel approach is used to simulate linear, kinetic response functions (KRFs) for species in plug flow, then to integrate with the conservative residence time density function (E-curve) to yield a residence time density for the reacted species. This kinetic E-curve can be used with linear operator methods such as convolution to yield the semi-analytical solution for nonuniform inputs, nonideal mixing, and complex reaction networks. Closed-form analytical solutions are presented for the linear response functions for straight, three-member reaction networks in plug flow. Only irreversible reactions are considered. Several examples with various mixing conditions are shown and compared to other analytical solutions. Although the approach is related to other transfer function models, the kinetic residence time density is a transfer function that is generated directly from the plug-flow response functions and the numerical evaluation of the E-curve. The advantage is that a wide variety of mixing conditions and reaction networks may be considered without the need to generate analytical transfer functions for each species and mixing condition. "

Both standing stock and diversity of the faunas, and the microhabitat of distinct species mirror the trophic situation and the depth of the oxidised layer at the different sites. Our results suggest that the faunas do not comprise highly opportunistic species and are adapted to rather stable environments. In the axial channel of the Lacaze-Duthiers Canyon, organic matter fluxes are enhanced due to advective transport of organic matter resulting in elevated oxygen consumption rates in the surface sediment and a rather thin oxidised layer. The corresponding benthic foraminiferal fauna is characterised by rather high standing stock and diversity, and a well-developed deep infauna. In addition to freshly deposited phytodetritus, more degraded organic matter seems to be an important food source. In contrast, at the open slope, organic matter fluxes and oxygen consumption rates in the surface sediment are lower and the oxidised layer is much thicker than inside the canyon. The corresponding benthic foraminiferal fauna comprises mainly epifaunal and shallow-infaunal species with much lower standing stocks and clear differences between February and August. In August standing stocks are higher and the average living depths of most species shift towards the sediment surface. These differences can be attributed to patchiness or represent a seasonal trophic signal. "

For a general chemical reaction system involving terminal species (reactants and products) and intermediates, the basic kinetic equation may be further partitioned into contributions coming from \{RERs\} involving only terminal species and those \{RERs\} involving at least one intermediate. When the intermediate are assumed to obey the quasi-steady state approximation, the contributions coming from the \{RERs\} involving at least one intermediate vanish. As a result, the basic kinetic equation may be presented as a sum of contributions coming from \{RERs\} involving only terminal species, i.e., overall RERs. This approach is shown to provide an adequate physicochemical basis of mechanisms and overall reactions as well as an effective algorithm of their enumeration. "

At low flowrates, the foam has a dry cellular texture with polyhedral cells and flow occurs entirely by slip near the wall. At high flowrates, a wet foam with spherical bubbles is formed and flow is characterised by strong bubble mobility and intensive bubble recirculation. Flow was characterised by a constant pressure gradient under both flow regimes, and foam rheology was successfully described by a power-law model. Friction factors were determined for all systems studied and the data lied remarkably on a unique line on the friction factor-Reynolds number plot. An explicit relationship for predicting the friction factor in foam flows is presented, based on a wide range of experimental conditions. The model has practical significance in that pressure drop in foam flow can be calculated using a constant friction factor along a pipe of constant cross section, in any flow regime. "

Recently, heterozygous mutations of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase (TK) ROR2, located within a distinct segment directly after the \{TK\} domain, have been shown to be responsible for BDB. We report four novel mutations in \{ROR2\} (two frameshifts, one splice mutation, and one nonsense mutation) in five families with BDB. The mutations predict truncation of the protein within two distinct regions immediately before and after the \{TK\} domain, resulting in a complete or partial loss of the intracellular portion of the protein. Patients affected with the distal mutations have a more severe phenotype than do those with the proximal mutation. Our analysis includes the first description of homozygous \{BDB\} in an individual with a 5-bp deletion proximal to the \{TK\} domain. His phenotype resembles an extreme form of brachydactyly, with extensive hypoplasia of the phalanges and metacarpals/metatarsals and absence of nails. In addition, he has vertebral anomalies, brachymelia of the arms, and a ventricular septal defect—features that are reminiscent of Robinow syndrome, which has also been shown to be caused by mutations in ROR2. The \{BDB\} phenotype, as well as the location and the nature of the \{BDB\} mutations, suggests a specific mutational effect that cannot be explained by simple haploinsufficiency and that is distinct from that in Robinow syndrome.

It is often difficult to create a formal evaluation process due to the unique nature of the alliance structure. We propose the use of the balanced scorecard as a means to develop a formal assessment approach that links performance evaluation to the objective of the alliance. The result is a generic template that can be adapted to the specific alliance evaluation requirements of a particular organization. "

Stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) occurs after many different sublethal stresses including H2O2, hyperoxia, or tert-butylhydroperoxide. Cells in replicative senescence share common features with cells in SIPS: morphology, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, cell cycle regulation, gene expression and telomere shortening. Telomere shortening is attributed to the accumulation of \{DNA\} single-strand breaks induced by oxidative damage. \{SIPS\} could be a mechanism of accumulation of senescent-like cells in vivo. Melanocytes exposed to sublethal doses of \{UVB\} undergo SIPS. Melanocytes from dark- and light- skinned populations display differences in their cell cycle regulation. Delayed \{SIPS\} occurs in melanocytes from light-skinned populations since a reduced association of p16Ink-4a with \{CDK4\} and reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein are observed. The role of reactive oxygen species in melanocyte \{SIPS\} is unclear. Both replicative senescence and \{SIPS\} are dependent on two major pathways. One is triggered by \{DNA\} damage, telomere damage and/or shortening and involves the activation of the p53 and p21waf-1 proteins. The second pathway results in the accumulation of p16Ink-4a with the \{MAP\} kinase signalling pathway as possible intermediate. These data corroborate the thermodynamical theory of ageing, according to which the exposure of cells to sublethal stresses of various natures can trigger SIPS, with possible modulations of this process by bioenergetics.

Parasite proteinases appear to play important roles at all stages of the erythrocytic cycle of human malaria. Proteases involved in erythrocyte rupture and invasion are possibly required to breakdown erythrocyte membrane skeleton. To identify such proteases, soluble cytosolic extract of isolated trophozoites/schizonts was incubated with erythrocyte membrane ghosts or spectrin-actin depleted inside-out vesicles, which were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In both cases, a new protein band of 155 kDa was detected. The N-terminal peptide sequencing established that the 155 kDa band represents truncated ankyrin. Immunoblot analysis using defined monoclonal antibodies confirmed that ankyrin was cleaved at the C-terminus. While the enzyme preferentially cleaved ankyrin, degradation of protein 4.1 was also observed at high concentrations of the enzyme. The optimal activity of the purified enzyme, using ankyrin as substrate, was observed at pH 7.0–7.5, and the activity was strongly inhibited by standard inhibitors of cysteine proteinases (cystatin, NEM, leupeptin, E-64 and \{MDL\} 28 170), but not by inhibitors of aspartic (pepstatin) or serine (PMSF, DFP) proteinases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that protease digestion of ankyrin substantially reduces its interaction with ankyrin-depleted membrane vesicles. Ektacytometric measurements showed a dramatic increase in the rate of fragmentation of ghosts after treatment with the protease. Although the role of ankyrin cleavage in vivo remains to be determined, based on our findings we postulate that the parasite-derived cysteine protease activity cleaves host ankyrin thus weakening the ankyrin-band 3 binding interactions and destabilizing the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, which, in turn, facilitates parasite release. Further characterization of the enzyme may lead to the development of novel antimalarial drugs. "

The localization of nNOS in the \{H2\} and \{H3\} cells is a novel finding. None of these antibodies labels \{H4\} cells. The photoreceptor subtypes have been differentiated by different intensity of labeling with CB. The accessory member of the double cone is less intensely labeled with \{CB\} than the principal member and rods and blue cones do not appear to label at all. ChAT-IR is located in terminal boutons of \{H1\} and \{H2\} horizontal cells and \{H1\} axon terminals and these boutons contact rods and all spectral types of cones. Clearly, \{GABA\} is present in \{H1\} horizontal cells and may be used in neurotransmission between horizontal cells and possibly for feedback pathways to photoreceptors. The evidence of nNOS immunoreactivity in \{H2\} and \{H3\} horizontal cells, combined with available physiological evidence, suggests that \{NO\} may be involved in electrical coupling and/or modulation of synaptic input to these types of cells.

abstract = {The expression pattern of the α and β isoforms and the γ subunit of the Na,K-ATPase was investigated during in vitro induction of pluripotent murine embryonic stem (ES) cells into neuronal cells. α1 protein was expressed in undifferentiated \{ES\} (UES) cells and throughout all stages studied. In contrast, α3 protein was prominent only when neuronal cells have reached full differentiation. In this model, neuron-depleted cultures did not express the α3 isoform, indicating its specificity for mature neuronal cells. \{UES\} possessed Na,K-ATPase activity consistent with a single isoform (α1), whereas in fully mature neuronal cells a ouabain-sensitive isoform (α3) accounted for 27±4% of the activity, and a ouabain-resistant isoform (α1) 66±3%. Immunocytochemistry of mature neuronal cells for α1 and α3 proteins showed a similar distribution, including cell soma and processes, without evidence of polarization. β1 protein was expressed in uninduced ES, embryonic bodies (EB) and neuronal cells. While proteins of the β2 and β3 isoforms were not detected by immunoblots (except for β2 in UES), their mRNAs were detected in \{UES\} and \{EB\} (β2 and β3), and in immature and fully differentiated neuronal cells (β3). Message for the β2 isoform, however, was not present in neuronal cells. γ subunit mRNA and protein were undetectable at any stage. These results provide further characterization of neuron-like cells obtained by induction of \{ES\} cells in vitro, and establish a model for the expression of isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase during neuronal differentiation. The relation to other aspects of neuronal cell development and relevance to a specialised function for the α3 subunit in neurons are discussed. "

Additionally, recent anatomical studies suggest that the midbrain tegmentum is an integral part of the audiomotor network. To describe the chemoarchitecture of these nuclei, taking into account the toral subdivisions, we investigated the distribution of serotonin, leucine–enkephalin, substance P, tyrosine–hydroxylase, dopamine D2-receptor, parvalbumin, aspartate, GABA, and estrogen-binding protein-immunoreactivity in the midbrain of Bombina orientalis, Discoglossus pictus and Xenopus laevis. In the torus semicircularis, the highest density of immunoreactive fibers and terminals for all transmitters was found in the laminar nucleus. Parvalbumin-like immunoreactivity was highest in the principal nucleus, and D2-receptor-like immunoreactivity was uniformly distributed throughout the torus. In the tegmentum, axons and/or dendrites were stained with all antibodies except estrogen-binding protein. Additionally, heavily stained enkephalin and substance P-immunopositive fiber plexus were found in the lateral and dorsal tegmentum. The immunostainings revealed no qualitative differences between the three species. Immunopositive cell bodies were labeled in several brain areas, the connectivity of which with torus and tegmentum is discussed on the background of functional questions. The putative neuromodulatory innervation of both the laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis and the tegmentum may be the anatomical basis for the influence of the animal’s endogenous state on the behavioral reaction to sensory stimuli. These data corroborate earlier anatomical and physiological findings that the neurons of these nuclei are key elements in the audio-motor interface. "

Naturally occurring operators differ from the consensus sequence to a greater extent as the number of metboxes increases. MetJ, while accommodating this sequence variation in natural operators, is very sensitive to particular base changes, even where bases are not directly contacted in the crystal structure of a complex formed between the repressor and consensus operator. Results: Here we report the high-resolution structure of a MetJ mutant, Q44K, bound to the consensus operator sequence (Q44Kwt19) and two related sequences containing mutations at sites believed to be important for indirect readout at non-contacted bases. The overall structure of the \{Q44Kwt19\} complex is very similar to the wild-type complex, but there are small variations in sugar–phosphate backbone conformation and direct contacts to the \{DNA\} bases. The mutant complexes show a mixture of direct and indirect readout of sequence variations, with differences in direct contacts and \{DNA\} conformation. Conclusions: Comparison of the wild-type and mutant repressor–operator complexes shows that the repressor makes sufficiently strong interactions with the sugar–phosphate backbone to accommodate some variation in operator sequence with minor changes in direct bases contacts. The reduction in repressor affinity for the two mutant repressor complexes can be partially attributed to a loss in direct contacts to the DNA. In one case, however, the replacement of a flexible \{TA\} base-step leads to an unfavourable \{DNA\} conformation that reduces the stability of the repressor–operator complex. "

West of a major escarpment, these rocks are structurally overlain in the plateau by greenschist facies metamorphic rocks with steep fabrics dominant. Three Pan-African phases of deformation in eastern Eritrea (PAD1-3) were superposed during the Cenozoic by three phases of Red Sea lateral extension (RSE1-3). \{PAD1\} is characterised by steep penetrative foliation S1, which is axial planar to upright \{F1\} folds. These folds were distorted at depth by \{F2\} recumbent folds and subhorizontal shear zones during PAD2. \{PAD3\} deformation resulted mainly in steep strike-slip shear zones. All phases of NE–SW lateral extension of the Red Sea exploited steep \{PAD1\} and \{PAD3\} and flat-lying \{PAD2\} fabrics and structures. \{RSE1\} was semi-brittle and resulted in top-to-basin low-angle (=35°) NW–SE-trending normal faults that sole out to subhorizontal detachments at deep exposure levels. \{RSE2\} involved seaward block tilting on a new system of moderate to steep (≥40°) domino-style normal faults and dykes with NW–SE strikes above a younger detachment inferred beneath exposure levels. \{RSE2\} structures concentrate in zones of maximum crustal flexure across the escarpment and were preceded and/or accompanied by reverse faults near the foot of the escarpment. \{RSE2\} structures truncate \{RSE1\} and \{PAD2\} subhorizontal shear zones in the lowlands by exploiting steep \{PAD3\} structures along the escarpment and the in the plateau. The away-from-basin dip of the \{RSE2\} faults and dykes is attributed to isostatic rise of the asthenosphere offshore. \{RSE3\} involved NNW–SSE- to NNE–SSW-trending strike-slip faults associated with counterclockwise opening of the hinge where the Danakil block is still joined to Africa. The overall geometric relationships between Cenozoic faults and dykes and the Pan-African tectonic grain suggest that the Red Sea escarpment in eastern Eritrea is closer to a monoclinal flexure rather than a rift.

Because soluble recombinant \{TRANCE\} is a suboptimal osteoclastogenic stimulus, and to eliminate the need for such dependence on stromal cells, membrane-bound \{TRANCE\} was expressed in hematopoietic precursors using retroviral gene transfer. Four TRANCE-expressing osteoclast cell lines were established that continuously generate large numbers of multinucleated cells and express tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and calcitonin receptors. The multinuclear cells are long-lived and either fuse continuously with each other and with mononuclear cells to form enormous syncytia, or separate to form daughter multinuclear cells. When formed on bone, but not on plastic, the majority of multinuclear cells develop actin rings on bone, and resorb bone, suggesting that bone matrix may provide additional signals that facilitate osteoclastic functional maturation. Surprisingly, multinuclear cells originate from fusion of proliferating mononuclear cells that strongly express the mature macrophage markers F4/80 and Fc receptor, which are not expressed by osteoclasts. These results indicate that osteoclasts can be derived from F4/80-positive and Fc receptor-positive cells, and that \{TRANCE\} induces osteoclastic differentiation partly by suppressing the macrophage phenotype.

We present evidence that the interaction between plant roots, root exudates and micro-organisms can only be understood in relation to soil faunal activity, indicating that the soil fauna has an important function in regulating rhizosphere microbial processes and therefore significantly affects plant growth.

Pg−/− and t-PA−/− mice demonstrated an enhanced increase in lung collagen content relative to that observed in \{WT\} mice. Levels in u-PA−/− and u-PAR−/− mice were similar to those in \{WT\} mice. Histological analysis 14 days after lung injury confirmed enhanced interstitial fibrosis in Pg−/−, u-PA−/−, and t-PA−/− mice relative to \{WT\} and u-PAR−/− mice. Areas of pulmonary hemorrhage were observed in bleomycin-treated \{WT\} mice and not in Pg−/−, u-PA−/−, and u-PAR−/− mice or saline controls. Instead, extensive areas of fibrosis were present throughout the lungs of bleomycin-treated Pg−/− and u-PA−/− mice. A mixed phenotype (hemorrhage and fibrosis) was observed in t-PA−/− and Pg+/− mice. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages were abundant in the lungs of mice exhibiting hemorrhage and these mice were prone to an early death. Enhanced macrophage levels in the lungs and activation of matrix metalloelastase (MMP-12) were found in mice with a hemorrhage phenotype. The results of these studies indicate a role for the fibrinolytic system in acute lung injury and suggests that intra-alveolar hemorrhage is the result of basement membrane degradation through cell-mediated u-PA activation of Pg with possible involvement of matrix metalloproteinases. Absence of these two components of the fibrinolytic system, either urokinase or plasminogen, results in accelerated fibrosis. "

Herein, we revisited this issue by assessing the effect of Tinuvin 123 on dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra following its stereotaxic injection in the rat. Twenty-one days post unilateral stereotaxic injection of Tinuvin 123, systemic injection of both apomorphine and amphetamine caused rotations toward the side of the lesion in these rats. Tinuvin 123 produced a small to moderate dose-dependent reduction in striatal levels of dopamine and metabolites on the side of the lesion. This compound also produced dramatic cell loss in the substantia nigra on the side of the lesion. However, the loss of cells lacked the phenotypic specificity for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons that is expected with a dopaminergic neurotoxin. Indeed, aside from a robust glial reaction, both TH-positive and glutamic acid dehydrogenase (GAD)-positive neurons were destroyed, and near the site of the injection, there was complete tissue destruction. This study indicates that, using this mode of injection, Tinuvin 123 exerts a dramatic tissue toxicity without any evidence of specificity for dopaminergic neurons. Thus, our data argues against a role for Tinuvin 123 as an environmental toxin causing a clinical condition characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons as seen in PD. "

Results After the first passage, \{BMSC\} had a markedly diminish proliferation rate and gradually lost their multiple differentiation potential. Their bone-forming efficiency in vivo was reduced by about 36 times at first confluence as compared to fresh bone marrow. Experiments on the clones yielded comparable results. Conclusions Culture expansion causes \{BMSC\} to gradually lose their early progenitor properties. Both the duration and the conditions of culture could be crucial to successful clinical use of these cells and must be considered when designing novel therapeutic strategies involving stromal mesenchymal progenitor manipulation and reinfusion.

Jocicoeur, Nef harbors a makor determinant of pathogenicity for an AIDS-like disease induced by HIV-1 in transgenic mice. Cell 95 (1998) 163–175]. Nef expression has been detected in \{HIV\} infected human brains with neuronal damage [A. Ranki, M. Nyberg, V. Ovod, M. Haltia, I. Elovaara, R. Raininko, H. Haapsalo, K. Krohn, Abundant expression of \{HIV\} Nef and Rev proteins in brain astrocytes in associated with dementia, \{AIDS\} 9(9) (1995) 1001–1008; Y. Saito, L.R. Sharer, M.G. Epstein, J. Michaels, M.

It is postulated that nef may contribute to the neuronal damage observed in the brain of those with late \{HIV\} disease. To test this, the potential toxicity of recombinant nef (from HIV-1 IIIB) was compared to the neurotoxin human tumour necrosis alpha (TNFα) on human brain cells in culture. SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, primary human neurons and glial cells were exposed to recombinant nef or TNFα protein for 3 days or twice over 6 days. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan Blue, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and \{MTT\} assays. Nuclear fragmentation was detected using the Hoechst Blue nuclear dye assay. Both nef and TNFα (100 ng/ml) caused a significant 30% reduction of SK-N-SH cell numbers after 3 days exposure (P=0.001). At this time, exposure to nef caused evident fragmented nuclei in these cultures. Human neuronal cultures had a 32 and 33% decrease in cell number after 6 days exposure to either nef or TNFα, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, as previously shown [J. He, C.M. DeCastro, G.R. Vandenbark, J. Busciglio, D. Gabuzda, Astrocyte apoptosis induced by HIV-1 transactivation of the c-kit protoonocogene, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 94 (1997) 3954–3959], a 3-day exposure to nef significantly reduced human glial cell number by 25% (P=0.001). Recombinant nef and TNFα compromise human neurons in culture. Thus, like other virotoxins, it is shown for the first time that nef may also contribute to neuronal damage that has been reported in dementia in late \{HIV\} disease. "

abstract = {The last 2 decades have witnessed enormous changes in our understanding of allergic rhinitis. As we have begun to unravel the complex underlying immunologic and inflammatory pathophysiology of the disease, new therapeutic strategies as well as specific molecular and cellular constituents have emerged as potential targets for clinical intervention. These efforts also have shed light on the mechanisms by which current antiallergy medications act—or sometimes fail to be effective.7,31,51,89 The similar pathophysiologic basis for allergic rhinitis and the often comorbid condition, asthma, was underscored in the recently published American Thoracic Society Workshop Summary on the Immunobiology of Asthma and Rhinitis: Pathogenic Factors and Therapeutic Options.18 In his conclusion, workshop chair, Thomas Casale,18 counsels readers to consider that “…allergic asthma and rhinitis represent a systemic disease affecting two organs, the lung and the nose. Asthma and allergic rhinitis share many of the same pathogenic factors, but they operate in different parts of the airway. Inflammatory cells and mediators are often the same, and there may be common alterations that occur in the immune system.” Thus, therapeutic strategies and potential therapeutic agents found to be beneficial in the treatment of one airway target may show similar effects in the other. For this reason, and because many of the therapies now being developed are at early stages in their evolution, physicians interested in rhinitis therapy also must examine what is known about these agents in asthma. One avenue of active research has been the role of leukotrienes and other mediators in the pathophysiology of asthma and rhinitis. Three leukotriene modifiers now have been approved for the treatment of asthma in the United States; their potential use in the treatment of rhinitis has been a focus of considerable speculation and investigation. An early “day in the park” study showed that with antileukotriene therapy, patients with rhinitis had demonstrable improvements in their rhinitic symptoms.29 Roquet et al83 reported that in the treatment of asthma, there was a synergistic effect when an antileukotriene agent and an antihistamine were used, compared with either drug alone. A product combining an antileukotriene with an antihistamine is currently under development. The most exciting developments, however, may be in the immunology arena. As described by Baraniuk elsewhere in this issue, the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis is highly complex. Multiple interacting, interdependent, and redundant pathways and molecular and cellular constituents are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis. Briefly, exposure of the nasal mucosa to allergen in a sensitized individual leads to the release and further production of inflammatory mediators and the release of cytokines.5 These released cytokines activate endothelial cells, thereby inducing expression of adhesion receptors on the cell surface and initiating a cascade of events that facilitates transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells. T lymphocytes also are activated by these cytokines. Within a given tissue, specific patterns of cytokines are released, dependent on the dominant subset of local T lymphocytes. These, in turn, lead to the preferential activation and recruitment of specific inflammatory cells and the characteristic cellular inflammation observed in allergic rhinitis. "

We show here that overexpression of mouse Six6 in Xenopus embryos can induce transformation of competent tissue of the anterior neural plate into retinal tissue. In Six6 injected embryos, the molecular identity of the presumptive midbrain and rostral hindbrain regions was lost, as shown by the absence of XEn-2 and Xpax2 expression, being replaced by the ectopic expression of the retinal markers Xpax6 and Xrx. When allowed to grow further, Six6 injected embryos developed ectopic eye-like structures in the rostral brain and showed a transformation of the midbrain into retina. Similar results were obtained upon overexpression of Six3 or Xsix3, revealing a possible redundance of Six3 and Six6 activities. Taken together, results obtained suggest that during normal retina development, the relatively late expressed Six6 gene becomes part of a network of retinal homeobox genes that are linked together by positive feedback loops. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the primitive neural ectoderm of the future midbrain and rostral hindbrain is competent to form retinal tissue. "

The hierarchical model represents heterogeneous processor and network speeds, and may be used to represent processes in any parallel computing environment, including an SMP, a distributed-memory computer, a network of workstations, or some combination of these. Using this model to segment the computation into chunks which can fit into cache memory provides a potential efficiency gain from an increased cache hit rate, even in a single processor environment. The information about different processor speeds, memory sizes, and the corresponding interconnection network can be useful in a dynamic load balancing algorithm which seeks to achieve a good balance with minimal interprocessor communication penalties when a slow interconnection network is involved.

Simulation results yield information on wave speed and amplitude attenuation for two-dimensional, meso-domain model assembly systems of circular disks and spherical particles. Particulate models were numerically generated using a biasing scheme whereby partial control of particular fabric measures could be achieved. Particular fabric measures which were used to characterize the granular material models include branch and cementation vectors. Discrete element modeling (DEM) wave simulation results indicated that wave speed is dependent upon the stiffness of the interparticle contacts and distribution of branch vectors along the propagation direction. Wave amplitude attenuation is also dependent on the number of branch vectors in the direction of propagation. "

Immunostaining of the cell-sorted skin equivalent with human cell markers showed patterns similar to those of normal full-thickness skin. We compared the cell-sorted skin equivalent model with a composite skin model also made on severe combined immunodeficient mice. The composite grafts were constructed from partially differentiated keratinocyte sheets placed on top of a dermal equivalent constructed of devitalized dermis. Electron microscopy revealed that both models formed ample numbers of normal appearing hemidesmosomes. The cell-sorted skin equivalent model, however, had greater numbers of keratin intermediate filaments within the basal keratinocytes that connected to hemidesmosomes, and on the dermal side both collagen filaments and anchoring fibril connections to the lamina densa were more numerous compared with the composite model. Our results may provide some insight into why, in clinical applications for treating burns and other wounds, composite grafts may exhibit surface instability and blistering for up to a year following grafting, and suggest the possible usefulness of the cell-sorted skin equivalent in future grafting applications.

The results revealed substantial variability in attention that raters paid to different criteria varying from penalising students for spelling and/or grammatical errors to glossing over these criteria and considering mainly content. To overcome the problem of rater variability some researchers recommend that more than one rater be used. The problem is that in the teaching situation there is rarely more than one rater available, who is usually the teacher of the subject. The advantages and disadvantages of using a single rater and more than one rater are examined. Whether one uses one rater or several, without the quest for some kind of objective standard of what is, for example, (good) grammar and (good) spelling, and agreement on what importance to attach to particular criteria, there cannot be much reliability.

Neural networks appeared to be most efficient in reflecting the nonlinearities of the habitat–Collembola relationships. The underlying functional relations, however, are hidden within the network connections and cannot be analyzed easily. Model trees — next in predictive power to neural networks — are much more transparent and give an explicit picture of the functional relationships. Both modelling approaches perform significantly better than traditional statistical models and decrease the mean absolute error between prediction and observation by about 16–38%. Total carbon content and measurements highly correlated with it (e.g. total nitrogen content, microbial biomass and respiration) were the most important factors influencing the Collembolan community.

In contrast to standard QNA, QNA-MC allows for the specification and evaluation of multicast routes. As in real multicast communication, packets leaving a particular node can be copied and deterministically routed to several other nodes. In order to analyse such queueing networks, QNA-MC converts the multicast routes to a suitable input for standard QNA. From the results delivered by QNA, QNA-MC then derives several performance measures for multicast streams in the network. A validation of QNA-MC, via a comparison to simulation results, shows that QNA-MC yields very good results.

abstract = {Abstract We address a problem faced by every supplier of electricity, i.e. forecasting the short-term electricity consumption. The introduction of new techniques has often been justified by invoking the nonlinearity of the problem. Our focus is directed to the question of deciding whether the problem is indeed nonlinear. First, we introduce a nonlinear measure of statistical dependence. Second, we analyse the linear and the nonlinear autocorrelation functions of the Czech electric consumption. Third, we compare the predictions of nonlinear models (artificial neural networks) with linear models (of the \{ARMA\} type). The correlational analysis suggests that forecasting the short-term evolution of the Czech electric load is primarily a linear problem. This is confirmed by the comparison of the predictions. In the light of this case study, the conditions under which neural networks could be superior to linear models are discussed. "

Role of the complement system in antigen-induced bronchoconstriction and changes in blood pressure in the guinea pig. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 267, 979–988] demonstrated that preventing complement system activation resulted in inhibition of anaphylaxis in the guinea pig, and that the C-terminal 21 amino acids of guinea pig \{C3a\} (C3a-peptide) mimic the symptoms of anaphylactic shock in the guinea pig [Regal, J.F., 1997. Role of the complement system in pulmonary disorders. Immunopharmacology 38, 17–25]. To determine if \{C3a\} is an essential mediator of systemic anaphylaxis, the anaphylactic response to ovalbumin (OA) was assessed in guinea pigs genetically deficient in the \{C3a\} receptor (C3aR−) compared to their control strain of animals which were \{C3a\} receptor positive (C3aR+). In addition, the response to another control strain of animals, Hartley guinea pigs, was determined. Sensitized guinea pigs were anesthetized, and bronchoconstriction and changes in blood pressure were monitored in response to intravenous (i.v.) injection of either C3a-peptide, recombinant human \{C5a\} (rHuC5a) or OA. Both Hartley guinea pigs and C3aR+ animals responded similarly to C3a-peptide and rHuC5a. C3aR− animals, however, were unresponsive to C3a-peptide and responded normally to rHuC5a, confirming their functional deficiency of the \{C3a\} receptor. In response to OA, C3aR+ animals and Hartley guinea pigs responded with a severe bronchoconstriction, an initial transient hypotension, followed by an increase in blood pressure and a delayed prolonged hypotensive response. In contrast, in C3aR− animals, the increased blood pressure response to \{OA\} was significantly prolonged, the delayed hypotensive response was blunted, and the bronchoconstriction was delayed compared to the C3aR+ animals. The difference in the anaphylactic response could not be explained by differing amounts of OA-specific IgG1 antibody or \{C3a\} generated during the anaphylactic response. Thus, these data suggest that \{C3a\} plays a minor role in the hypotension of systemic anaphylaxis and investigation of a role for other products of complement system activation, either alone or in combination with C3a, is clearly warranted.

Fish and zooplankton layers were distinguished by comparing 12 kHz sonar and 153 kHz \{ADCP\} backscatter data, which indicated that the strongly migrating layers were predominantly composed of fishes. Fish vertical migration speeds were independently estimated from the slopes of the volume scattering layers and from the vertical velocity components of the ADCP, yielding average speeds of 4 and 3 cm s−1 and maximum speeds of 13 and 10 cm s−1, respectively. A few migrating zooplankton layers were identified with an average speed of about 2 cm s−1 and maximum speeds as high as 8 cm s−1. Migration depths for both zooplankton and fish differed somewhat amongst stations and appeared to be related to local hydrographic conditions (principally the vertical gradients in \{DO\} and water temperature). Zooplankton displacement volumes at individual sites suggested that zooplankton biomass during the Southwest Monsoon could be as much as fivefold greater than during the Spring Intermonsoon. This observation was confirmed for the region in general by first deriving a relationship between \{ADCP\} backscatter intensity and daytime zooplankton biomass and then comparing the latter between cruises using daytime \{ADCP\} data taken along a 1500 km transect that extended from the coast of Somalia to the center of the northern basin.

Yet, the complexity and multidimensional nature of the \{WCST\} increases the likelihood that several different cognitive processes, perhaps mediated by different neural systems, are being tapped. Methods: In the current study, the Abstraction and Working Memory (AIM) task was designed to disentangle abstraction and working memory so that the effects of each cognitive domain could be independently analyzed. The \{AIM\} task and a battery of neuropsychological tests were administered to 62 patients with schizophrenia and 62 matched healthy volunteers. Results: Whereas patients with schizophrenia demonstrated deficits in simple abstraction, they were disproportionately impaired with the addition of a minimal memory requirement. Conclusions: Group differences on \{WCST\} performance appear to be attributable to patients’ inability to maintain information over a short delay, before that information is used for more complex cognitive operations.

abstract = {The concept of regulatory feedback circuit refers to oriented cyclic interactions between elements of a system. There are two classes of circuits, positive and negative, whose properties are in striking contrast. Positive circuits are a prerequisite for the occurrence of multiple steady states (multistationarity), and hence, they are involved in all processes showing hysteresis or memory. Endogenous or exogenous perturbations can lead the system to exhibit or to evoke one particular stable regime. The role of positive circuits in cell differentiation and in immunology is well documented. Negative circuits are involved in homeostatic regulation, with or without oscillations. The aim of this paper is to show: a) that positive circuits account for many features of memory stricto sensu (i.e., neural memory and mnesic evocation) as well as largo sensu (e.g. differentiation or immunological memory); and b) that simple combinations of positive and negative circuits provide powerful regulatory modules, which can also be associated in batteries. These entities have vast dynamical possibilities in the field of neurobiology, as well as in the fields of differentiation and immunology. Here we consider a universal minimal regulatory module, for which we suggest to adopt the term ‘logical regulon’, which can be considered as an atom of Jacob's integron. It comprises a positive and a negative circuit in its interaction matrix, and we recall the main results related to the simultaneous presence of these circuits. Finally, we give three applications of this type of interaction matrix. The first two deal with the coexistence of multiple stable steady states and periodicity in differentiation and in an immunological system showing hysteretic properties. The third deals with the dual problems of synchronization and desynchronization of a neural model for hippocampus memory evocation processes. "

Perception is linked to structure, pattern recognition and learning and, thus, also to behaviour and the practical results of planning processes. Landscape evolution is based on the dynamic interaction between structure and functioning and also on history, which makes each landscape unique. The rate and magnitude of the changes in the landscape are the most important factors relating to the evolution of our landscapes.

The author articulates a number of lessons that have been learned, and identifies some lessons that should have been learned. Scott writes from the perspective of having been directly and centrally involved in the development and implementation of what has been characterized as “the New Zealand model” of public management for more than twenty years, a record of service that continues to date. The views expressed also benefit from extensive consulting by the author for governments around the world. Among the lessons learned are (a) the need for clarity of roles, responsibilities and accountability in the implementation of management reform, (b) the importance of matching decision capacity to responsibility, (c) the significance of ministerial commitment and clarity on expectations, (d) the advantages gained from structural innovations within the New Zealand cabinet, (e) the need to analyze disasters carefully for what they teach, (f) approaches to embrace and foibles to avoid in implementing performance specification, (g) problems caused by confusion over ownership and improper assessment of organizational capability, (h) the fact that actually doing strategic management in the public sector is hugely complicated, (i) that it is time to put an end to the notion that there is an “extreme model” of public management in application in New Zealand, and (j) that public management, government and governance innovations in New Zealand are no longer novel compared to those advanced in other nations. With respect to lessons not learned satisfactorily, many are simply the dark shadow of positive lessons, i.e., having not understood or implemented the successes achieved in some parts of New Zealand government into others. The author concludes with an admonition to avoid jumping too quickly, in response to post-electoral rhetoric, to the conclusion that past reforms in have to be modified quickly and radically, and that the New Zealand Model has failed.

In addition, primary cell walls must be capable of growth and are subjected to cell separation forces at the cell corners. To understand how these stresses are resisted by cell walls, it will be necessary to find out how the walls deform internally under load, and how rigid are specific constituents of each type of cell wall. The most promising spectroscopic techniques for this purpose are solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman microscopy. By \{NMR\} relaxation experiments, it is possible to probe thermal motion in each cell-wall component. Novel adaptations of \{FTIR\} and Raman spectroscopy promise to allow mechanical stress and strain upon specific polymers to be examined in situ within the cell wall. "

abstract = {Internet Protocol (IP) networks are currently undergoing transitions that mandate greater bandwidths and the need to prepare the network infrastructures for converged traffic (voice, video, and data). Thus, in the emerging environment of high performance \{IP\} networks, it is expected that local and campus area backbones, enterprise networks, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will use multigigabit and terabit networking technologies where \{IP\} routers will be used not only to interconnect backbone segments but also to act as points of attachments to high performance wide area links. Special attention must be given to new powerful architectures for routers in order to play that demanding role. In this paper, we describe the evolution of \{IP\} router architectures and highlight some of the performance issues affecting \{IP\} routers. We identify important trends in router design and outline some design issues facing the next generation of routers. It is also observed that the achievement of high throughput \{IP\} routers is possible if the critical tasks are identified and special purpose modules are properly tailored to perform them. "

In this article we discuss the mechanisms involved in the generation and the regulation of spontaneous activity patterns in the developing retina and the developing neocortex. Spontaneous activity in the developing retina propagates across the ganglion cell layer as waves of action potentials and drives rhythmic increases in intracellular calcium in retinal neurons. Retinal waves are mediated by a combination of chemical synaptic transmission and gap junctions, and the circuitry responsible for generating retinal waves changes with age and between species. In the developing cortex, spontaneous calcium elevations propagate across clusters of cortical neurons called domains. Cortical domains are generated by a regenerative mechanism involving second messenger diffusion through gap junctions and subsequent calcium release from internal stores. The neocortical gap junction system is regulated by glutamate-triggered second messenger systems as well as neuromodulatory transmitters, suggesting extensive interactions between synaptic transmission and information flow through gap junctions. The interaction between gap junctions and chemical synaptic transmission observed in these developing networks represent a powerful mechanism by which activity across large groups of neurons can be correlated.

abstract = {Calcium release units (CRUs) are junctions between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and exterior membranes that mediates excitation contraction (e-c) coupling in muscle cells. In skeletal muscle \{CRUs\} contain two isoforms of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+release channel: ryanodine receptors type 1 and type 3 (RyR1 and RyR3). 1B5s are a mouse skeletal muscle cell line that carries a null mutation for RyR1 and does not express either RyR1 or RyR3. These cells develop dyspedic SR/exterior membrane junctions (i.e., dyspedic calcium release units, dCRUs) that contain dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and triadin, two essential components of CRUs, but no RyRs (or feet). Lack of RyRs in turn affects the disposition of DHPRs, which is normally dictated by a linkage to RyR subunits. In the dCRUs of 1B5 cells, \{DHPRs\} are neither grouped into tetrads nor aligned in two orthogonal directions. We have explored the structural role of RyR3 in the assembly of \{CRUs\} in 1B5 cells independently expressing either RyR1 or RyR3. Either isoform colocalizes with \{DHPRs\} and triadin at the cell periphery. Electron microscopy shows that expression of either isoform results in \{CRUs\} containing arrays of feet, indicating the ability of both isoforms to be targeted to dCRUs and to assemble in ordered arrays in the absence of the other. However, a significant difference between RyR1- and RyR3-rescued junctions is revealed by freeze fracture. While cells transfected with RyR1 show restoration of \{DHPR\} tetrads and \{DHPR\} orthogonal alignment indicative of a link to RyRs, those transfected with RyR3 do not. This indicates that RyR3 fails to link to \{DHPRs\} in a specific manner. This morphological evidence supports the hypothesis that activation of RyR3 in skeletal muscle cells must be indirect and provides the basis for failure of e-c coupling in muscle cells containing RyR3 but lacking RyR1 (see the accompanying report, Fessenden et al., 2000).

The objective of this review is to present this complexity as it applies to immune response.

In the present review, after a general overview of the current knowledge regarding apoptosis, cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix, the results obtained utilizing multicellular tumor spheroids in these types of studies are discussed. The main conclusion that may be drawn from a synthesis of the literature on these topics is that investigations with multicellular tumor spheroids yield much useful information that is sometimes in contradiction to that obtained with monolayer cultures, but is closer to that derived from in vivo studies.

We have previously shown that resistance in C57Bl/6 mice was also associated with a significantly lower percentage of MRP14-positive cells in the infiltrate than in susceptible BALB/c mice. In C57Bl/6 mice, weekly injections of bone marrow (BM) cells enriched with MRP14-positive cells (dl of culture) did not reverse, but prolonged the course of infection, associated with increased local parasite spread. In BALB/c mice a single dose of an antiphlogistic agent (dexamethasone or lipoxygenase inhibitor) was associated with reduction of infiltrating MRP14-positive cells and also with a decrease of parasite loads in footpads, lymph nodes as well as spleens, and with delayed progression of disease. Double labeling experiments in vitro revealed that at least 43.1 % of MRP14-positive mononuclear cells in \{BM\} cultures (8h) had phagocytosed parasites after 4 h of co-incubation. Activation by IFN-γ (20 U/ml) for 24h and 48h did not significantly reduce parasite load in these cells. In contrast, 77.0% of F4/80-positive macrophages (6d of culture) were infected with L. major parasites and these cells responded to activation with IFN-γ (20 U/ml) with significant reduction of parasite load (25.3%). The protein \{MRP14\} did not have an effect on parasite survival in vitro.

We found that the steady-state outputs of the four major binaural types of cells found in the \{DNLL\} (EI, EI/F, EE/I, and EE/FI) could be accounted for by known connectional patterns using only one or two cells per nucleus and quite simple hypotheses on cell behavior. In this study, we examine the time course of \{DNLL\} outputs in response to constant, ongoing, monaural or binaural sounds of various intensities. The model auditory nerve fibers ramp up linearly (usually in 2 ms) to full firing and the anteroventral cochlear nucleus cells have primary-like discharge patterns. Fixed time delays of 1 ms at each synapse are included; other time delays are employed when necessary to understand and reproduce specific features of the experimental data. We find that the connectional patterns utilized in our previous study can account for the rich variety of temporal response patterns found experimentally in the DNLL. Our main findings are: (1) all of the four major binaural types of cells can arise from modifications of the basic connectional pattern that produces \{EI\} cells; (2) both excitation and inhibition from the ipsilateral lateral superior olive (LSO) are required to understand \{DNLL\} responses; (3) pauser behavior can arise either from time delayed inhibition from a \{DNLL\} interneuron or by projection from the LSO; (4) two different mechanisms can account for the ipsilaterally evoked onset response; (5) to explain completely the temporal discharge pattern and binaural interactions of EE/FI cells, a projection from the contralateral \{DNLL\} via the commissure of Probst is necessary.

In most cases, physiological cell death occurs by apoptosis as opposed to necrosis. Defects in apoptotic cell death regulation contribute to many diseases, including disorders where cell accumulation occurs (cancer, restenosis) or where cell loss ensues (stroke, heart failure, neurodegeneration, AIDS). In recent years, the molecular machinery responsible for apoptosis has been elucidated, revealing a family of intracellular proteases, the caspases, which are responsible directly or indirectly for the morphological and biochemical changes that characterize the phenomenon of apoptosis. Diverse regulators of the caspases have also been discovered, including activators and inhibitors of these cell death proteases. Inputs from signal transduction pathways into the core of the cell death machinery have also been identified, demonstrating ways of linking environmental stimuli to cell death responses or cell survival maintenance. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis is providing insights into the causes of multiple pathologies where aberrant cell death regulation occurs and is beginning to provide new approaches to the treatment of human diseases.

Fish from six families per population were PIT-tagged and reared together in a 5×5×5 m sea cage between April 1997 and September 1998. The distribution of muscle fibre diameters in different age classes was investigated using non-parametric smoothing and bootstrapping techniques. Body mass and the total cross-sectional area of white muscle at the level of the first dorsal fin ray increased at a significantly faster rate in strain X than in strain Y after the first 6 months in seawater (April–October). The relative contributions of fibre recruitment and hypertrophy to muscle growth were very different for the two populations. The number of white muscle fibres per trunk cross-section was around 150,000 in June and 250,000 in July for both populations. The majority of fish sampled in June, July and August 1997 showed a unimodal distribution of fibre diameter. Between July and August fish from strain Y recruited two times more fibres for each square millimeter increase in white muscle cross-sectional area than fish from strain X. Fibre number in strain X had caught up with strain Y by January with 545,000 fibres per cross-section. There was no significant increase in the number of white fibres in strain Y between January and September 1998, such that growth was entirely by fibre hypertrophy. In contrast, fibre number continued to increase in strain X until the final sample in June, reaching 718,000 per trunk cross-section. All fish showed a bimodal distribution of fibre diameter in the October and subsequent samples with significant differences between strains. The right-hand peak of the distribution was shifted towards higher diameters in strain X than in strain Y, indicating superior hypertrophic growth performance in the early maturing population. For example, in the May 1998 sample, the 95th percentile of fibre diameter was at 215 μm in strain X and 171 μm in strain Y. In March and subsequent samples, the left-hand peak of the distribution was shifted to higher fibre diameters in strain Y relative to strain X, reflecting the cessation of new fibre recruitment in strain Y. Immature fish within strain X had a lower density of small diameter fibres and the right-tail of the distribution was shifted to higher diameters relative to fish that had begun to sexually mature. Thus greater muscle fibre hypertrophy was observed in immature than maturing fish of the same strain. It was concluded that the superior growth performance of the early maturing population was associated with a longer period of fibre recruitment and greater fibre hypertrophy than in the late maturing population, although these differences were not directly related to sexual maturation.

Results Attachment to both \{KM102\} and normal \{BM\} stromal cells significantly promoted the growth of Reh cells. Pretreatment of Reh cells with anti-integrin β1 or α5 monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not α4 or ICAM-1 mAb, abrogated this enhancement of proliferation. Furthermore, stroma attachment resulted in shortening of the \{G1\} phase of cell cycle, significant increases cdk2 activity, degradation of cdk inhibitor p27-GST protein, and decrease in levels of p27Kip1 protein. In addition, solid-phase cross-linking of α5 via immobilized antibody also resulted in extracellular signal-regulated (ERK)-2 kinase phosphorylation, increase in cdk2 activity, decrease in levels of p27Kip1 protein, and enhanced proliferation that was inhibited by treatment with PD98059, a specific \{ERK\} inhibitor. Conclusion Integrin α5β1-mediated stroma contact promotes the proliferation of B-cell progenitors through the activation of ERK-2, which in turn modulates cell cycle regulation machinery including induction of cdk2 activity and degradation of p27Kip1 and contributing to acceleration of the \{G1\} phase of cell cycle progression.

It is asserted that this condition, termed carbon lock-in, creates persistent market and policy failures that can inhibit the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies despite their apparent environmental and economic advantages. The notion of a Techno-Institutional Complex is introduced to capture the idea that lock-in occurs through combined interactions among technological systems and governing institutions. While carbon lock-in provides a conceptual basis for understanding macro-level barriers to the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies, it also generates questions for standard economic modeling approaches that abstract away technological and institutional evolution in their elaboration. The question of escaping carbon lock-in is left for a future paper. "

abstract = {The evolution, paragenetic context and origin of remarkably low δD hydrothermal fluids from the Hercynian Panasqueira W-Sn-Cu(Ag) deposit have been investigated through a combined microthermometric, stable isotope, halogen and noble gas fluid inclusion study. Large variations in δD between −60 ‰ and −134‰ have been observed in primary fluid inclusions from growth zones in a quartz crystal (Pa66) paragenetically constrained to the main sulfide stage (MSS) of ore formation. The same fluids exhibited relatively constant fluid inclusion homogenisation temperatures (254 to 260°C), salinities (7.4 to 8.7 wt.% NaCl equivalent) and calculated fluid δ18O (3.8 to 4.4‰). All the fluids exhibited 40Ar excesses. Mean molar Br/Cl and I/Cl ratios varied from 2.3 × 10−3–4.2 × 10−3 and 8 × 10−4–10 × 10−4 respectively, with the more Br-rich fluids being associated with the more deuterium-depleted fluids. The low palaeolatitude of Panasqueira throughout the main stages of ore formation and the overwhelming predominance of meteoric fluids in the main, late and post-ore mineralising fluids with δD of −40 to −65‰ lends little support for any models involving low δD palaeometeoric water. The limited range of 40Ar∗/Cl ratios (1.1 × 10−5–1.6 × 10−5) also precludes boiling during the \{MSS\} or mixing of meteoric water with highly fractionated deuterium-depleted magmatic waters as viable mechanisms for producing the low δD fluids. The high Br/Cl and I/Cl of the \{MSS\} fluids indicate significant fluid interactions with organic rich sediments or metasediments, in particular regionally abundant Carboniferous coals or coaly sediments that are inferred to be depleted in deuterium by around 85‰ compared to palaeometeoric water. The large range of δD observed in the \{MSS\} fluids may be explained by isotopic exchange of palaeometeoric water with these coals at varying water/rock (wt./wt.) ratios between 0.02 and 0.002 with fluid oxygen isotopic compositions controlled by exchange with the Beira Schists. Such a model is consistent with the requirements that any satisfactory model must take into account viz. (i) the relative constancy of temperature, salinity, 40Ar∗ and fluid δ18O during excursions to low δD; (ii) the high I/Cl and Br/Cl ratios observed; and (iii) the coincidence of these low δD fluids with the onset of precipitation of polymetallic sulfides and phosphates under reducing conditions. The model indicates that (meta)sedimentary sources of ore forming components became increasingly important during the evolution of the Panasqueira Sn-W deposit and accounts in part for the observed progression from oxide-dominated to base-metal sulfide-dominated parageneses.

Molecular approaches to these models are reviewed, focusing on our strategy for analyzing conditioned taste aversion learning. Three questions must be answered: Where do the long-term changes occur within the distributed neural network that mediates feeding? This answer reveals the site of neuronal restructuring mediated by gene expression. When does the transition occur from short-term expression to long-term persistence of the change in behavior? This transition reveals the critical time of gene expression. What genes are expressed during the change in behavior? The expression of thousands of genes in discrete subpopulations of cells is likely to be required during critical periods of neuronal restructuring. The identification of these genes is a general challenge for molecular neurobiology. The analysis of ingestive behavior can profit from molecular tools, but ingestion also provides informative models that elucidate the principles of time- and neuron-specific gene expression mediating complex behaviors.

The whole system is a mature mud/sand-rich submarine fan on a passive margin. Multi-beam echo sounder data, 3.5 kHz seismic and 12 Küllenberg cores were examined to define the fan morphology, the lithological characteristics, the sedimentary processes and the relationship between the evolution of the fan deposits and the environmental conditions on the Celtic continental shelf. The upper fan is characterised by the presence of two distinct tributary systems: (1) the Whittard system with a large, persistent, slightly sinuous channel, which is linked to the southern end of the Irish Sea River system; and (2) the Shamrock system, with a moderate sized channel, which is linked to the western end of the English Channel River system. The middle and lower fan corresponds to divergent braided secondary channels and associate lobes. Successive lobe elements, without important relief, were generated during periodic avulsions of middle fan channels. The lithological, palaeontological, and geochemical analyses on cores show the evolution of sedimentation since the last glaciation. During the last lowstand and rise of sea-level frequent low-density turbidity currents were predominant and deposited sediments throughout the whole fan system. They were initiated at the front of a deltaic environment on the Celtic outer-shelf. During the high sea-level conditions, occasional high-density turbidity currents and/or non-cohesive debris flows occur and were responsible for sand deposition in the middle-lower fan. They are derived from reworked sands due to the high-energy conditions on the outer shelf. Thus for the Celtic Fan, the variations of the hydrodynamic conditions on the outer Celtic Shelf seem to be the primary control on facies shift and fan growth. "

After a 3-day treatment, the cell cycle was reversibly arrested in G0/G1, suggesting the involvement of \{GTP\} in the cell cycle process.

When arrested in G0/G1, cells displayed a surprising resistance to a 3-h period of heat shock at 45°C. Considering the lack of coimmunoprecipitation of p21ras with Raf-1, the reduction of the level of GTP-associated p21ras and the decrease of the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK), also known as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, in ribavirin-treated cells, we suggest a possible relationship between the expression of heat-shock proteins and the change, in GTP-depleted cells, of the regulation of Raf kinase by ras protein.

abstract = {Recently, we have witnessed a strong growth in the internationalization of many firms’ product development activities. However, the lack of attention devoted by scientific research to the management of international innovation contrasts sharply with the importance attached to it as a cornerstone of international business success. Although several empirical studies and normative theories have specified the communication requirements in innovation teams, an empirically based insight is definitely needed on the communication requirements and requirements that prevail in the complex context of international innovation teams, in which the participants are located in different company units, countries, and cultures. This article addresses the following research question: viewing international innovation as an interfunctional activity, what are the communication requirements an international innovation team is facing, and what are the communication capabilities (interface mechanisms) that may be adopted to initiate, develop, and launch the new product effectively and efficiently? An extensive case study research project was designed to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework. Over a two year time period, the research team has investigated selected innovation projects in four European multinational corporations. The analysis of the case study data suggests five requirements that determine the effectiveness and efficiency of communication in international product development teams: network transparency, knowledge codification, knowledge credibility, communication cost, secrecy. To cope with these communication requirements, organizations may create firm level capabilities (parallel structures, cross-functional and inter-unit climate, communication infrastructure, goal congruence) and team level capabilities (core team, team leadership, formalization, procedural justice). The evidence from the in-depth case study research indicates that these mechanisms provide a parsimonious and powerful approach to address the communication requirements in international product innovation teams. After the information processing framework proposed by Tushman and Nadler 124, the adoption of these mechanisms is expected to improve innovation effectiveness. This holds important consequences for the management of international product innovation projects. First, the innovating firm must balance centralization and decentralization, employ formal as well as informal strategies, and integrate ad-hoc and permanent strategies. Second, it highlights the critical role of the project leader. Given the fact that companies often select the most available person, rather than the best person for the job, the allocation of light weight project leaders may create heavyweight problems in international teams. Third, following the argument in favor of procedural justice, the absence of involvement may severely hinder cross-functional commitment to international innovation projects. Fourth, the innovating firm must also actively manage the communication flows with external parties. Failure to do so may result in flawed specifications, and a limited understanding about product design and market strategies. "

The many deformation processes (poroelasticity, fracturing, irreversible nonlinear viscosity, and pressure solution) are inextricably bound in a tightly coupled network which, in turn, is coupled to a myriad of basin diagenetic, thermal and hydrologic processes. In the approach presented here, the various deformation processes are integrated through an incremental stress approach. Together with mass, momentum and energy conservation, this approach yields a complete, fully coupled basin model that captures basin and fault phenomena that are beyond the scope of simpler or decoupled models. Many of the most interesting basin phenomena are not only dependent on multiple, coupled processes but also are fundamentally three-dimensional. To address this three-dimensional complexity, we have developed a numerical simulator using a moving, adapting, accreting finite element grid which is allowed to deform and to grow and adapt with the addition of sediment to capture smaller sedimentary features. As a result, our fully coupled, comprehensive model allows one to solve a number of key problems in basin and fault dynamics. These include compaction, fractured reservoir and compartment genesis and dynamics. Examples illustrating these applications are presented for idealized systems and the Piceance Basin (Colorado) and the Permian Basin (West Texas). The incremental stress rheology is found to be a powerful formalism for integrating basin hydrology, diagenesis and mechanics. "

In particular, the water structure around the tightly bound Mg2+ is now clearly resolved, and hence provides more accurate information on the geometry of the magnesium-binding sites and the role of water molecules in coordinating the metal ions to the tRNA. We have assigned a total of ten magnesium ions and identified a partly conserved geometry for high-affinity Mg2+ binding. In the electron density map there is also clear density for a spermine molecule binding in the major groove of the TΨC arm and also contacting a symmetry-related tRNA molecule.

There are a number of lessons to be learned, which must be collated so as to stimulate faster progression along the learning curve.

abstract = {Objectives: Evidence from cortical electrophysiology and functional imaging converges on the view that visual spatial selective attention results in a facilitation of early sensory processing in visual cortical structures. Little is known, however, about the neural control processes that lead to this facilitation. The present study was aimed at further investigating these control processes and their neural correlates by analyzing high spatial resolution maps of brain activity that were evoked by attention-directing cues, but occurred prior to presentation of the target stimulus. Methods: Subjects (n=14) were presented with central arrow cues that instructed them to attend covertly to either a left or right field location in order to compare two subsequent target stimuli simultaneously presented to the location. On half of the trials, targets were presented to the cued location, while in the other half, targets were presented to the opposite visual field location. Subjects had to respond via button press on 16% of the trials when target stimuli were identical. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 92 scalp electrodes which allowed a sufficiently finegrained analysis of the regional specificity of the \{ERP\} components. Results: In response to the cues, an initial component over occipital-parietal electrode sites was consistent with an early involvement of the posterior-parietal cortex, perhaps in the initial step of attentional orienting. A second component over the lateral-prefrontal cortex is consistent with the voluntary control and maintenance of attention, a function known to be subserved by frontal cortical structures. A late component narrowly focussed over occipital-temporal electrode sites is most plausibly related to activation of parts of the ventral extrastriate cortex. Conclusions: The data support the current view that voluntarily orienting visual attention in space leads to top-down modulations in cortical excitability of ventral extrastriate regions initiated by posterior-parietal and mediated by lateral-prefrontal cortical structures.

abstract = {Voluntary agri-environmental schemes based on management agreements characterise much agri-environmental policy across the \{EU\} at present, and have expanded following the implementation of Regulation 2078/92 in all member states. Schemes generally motivate individual farmers to contract with government agencies to produce countryside goods in return for compensatory payments. Hence, farmers’ decisions to participate are central to achieving policy objectives. An enhanced understanding of farmers’ attitudes to and perceptions of schemes and their implementation would be of value for policy development. Recent transactions-cost research has observed that such schemes involve potentially heavy transactions costs, for both the state and farmers. In addition to reducing scheme cost-effectiveness, the transactions costs incurred by farmers can form a significant constraint on participation in schemes, with adverse effects on the supply of conservation goods. This paper considers behavioural and transactional perspectives on scheme participation. Some new data on the transactional burdens experienced by farmers when participating in schemes is examined from the perspective of identifying ways to improve policy transacting to ease constraints on participation where these exist. At the level of the individual participant, the development of agri-environmental one-stop-shops in member states for all schemes would allow transactions-cost economies, saving on the overhead costs of applying to different schemes with different objectives, as well as allowing a more integrated, less confused approach to participation. The longer-term value of farmer networks and capacity-building for agri-environmental management is important too. "

This interaction is significantly stronger and we show by an in vivo signaling assay that \{TRAF2\} signaling is more readily initiated by \{TRADD\} than by direct receptor–TRAF2 interactions. \{TRADD\} is specific for \{TRAF1\} and TRAF2, which ensures the recruitment of cIAPs for the direct inhibition of caspase activation in the signaling complex. The stronger affinity and unique specificity of the TRADD–TRAF2 interaction are crucial for the suppression of apoptosis and provide a mechanistic basis for the perturbation of \{TRAF\} recruitment in sensitizing cell death induction.

The elucidation of the three-dimensional solution structure of this 150 residue enzyme is a crucial step towards understanding α-sarcin’s conformational stability, ribonucleolytic activity, and its exceptionally high level of specificity. Here, the solution structure has been determined on the basis of 2658 conformationally relevant distances restraints (including stereoespecific assignments) and 119 torsional angular restraints, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods. A total of 60 converged structures have been computed using the program DYANA. The 47 best \{DYANA\} structures, following restrained energy minimization by GROMOS, represent the solution structure of α-sarcin. The resulting average pairwise root-mean-square-deviation is 0.86 Å for backbone atoms and 1.47 Å for all heavy atoms. When the more variable regions are excluded from the analysis, the pairwise root-mean-square deviation drops to 0.50 Å and 1.00 Å, for backbone and heavy atoms, respectively. The α-sarcin structure is similar to that reported for restrictocin, although some differences are clearly evident, especially in the loop regions. The average rmsd between the structurally aligned backbones of the 47 final α-sarcin structures and the crystal structure of restrictocin is 1.46 Å. On the basis of a docking model constructed with α-sarcin solution structure and the crystal structure of a 29-nt \{RNA\} containing the sarcin/ricin domain, the regions in the protein that could interact specifically with the substrate have been identified. The structural elements that account for the specificity of \{RNA\} recognition are located in two separate regions of the protein. One is composed by residues 51 to 55 and loop 5, and the other region, located more than 11 Å away in the structure, is the positively charged segment formed by residues 110 to 114. "

E. coli tRNAGln possesses the canonical Pu15-Py48 trans pairing at this position (G15-C48), while the tRNACys species from this organism instead features an unusual G15-G48 pair. To explore the structural context dependence of a G15-G48 Levitt pair, a number of tRNAGln species containing G15-G48 were constructed and evaluated as substrates for glutaminyl and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetases. The glutaminylation efficiencies of these mutant tRNAs are reduced by two to tenfold compared with native tRNAGln, consistent with previous findings that the tertiary core of this tRNA plays a role in GlnRS recognition. Introduction of tRNACys identity nucleotides at the acceptor and anticodon ends of tRNAGln produced a tRNA substrate which was efficiently aminoacylated by CysRS, even though the tertiary core region of this species contains the tRNAGln G15-C48 pair. Surprisingly, introduction of G15-G48 into the non-cognate tRNAGln tertiary core then significantly impairs CysRS recognition. By contrast, previous work has shown that CysRS aminoacylates tRNACys core regions containing G15-G48 with much better efficiency than those with G15-C48. Therefore, tertiary nucleotides surrounding the Levitt pair must significantly modulate the efficiency of aminoacylation by CysRS. To explore the detailed nature of the structural interdependence, crystal structures of two tRNAGln mutants containing G15-G48 were determined bound to GlnRS. These structures show that the larger purine ring of \{G48\} is accommodated by rotation into the syn position, with the \{N7\} nitrogen serving as hydrogen bond acceptor from several groups of G15. The G15-G48 conformations differ significantly compared to that observed in the native tRNACys structure bound to EF-Tu, further implicating an important role for surrounding nucleotides in maintaining the integrity of the tertiary core and its consequent ability to present crucial recognition determinants to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

The probit-based model with modifications similar to the principles in Nielsen [Nielsen, O.A., 1996. Do stochastic traffic assignment models consider differences in road users utility functions? Twentyfourth European Transport Forum (PTRC Annual Meeting). London, UK, Seminar M.] is used as a starting point. This makes it possible to describe passengers’ different preferences towards different sub-modes and against transfers. This also considers dependencies of choices through chains of sub-modes. The simulation of perceived travel times is extended to describe differences in the distribution of travel- and waiting times for different sub-modes. Parallel lines are frequency aggregated in order to handle waiting times appropriately. Initial tests on a full-scale case show that the methodology can describe route choices in public transport very well. This is both due to the model’s ability to describe overlapping routes and due to the many different coefficients, error components and distributions that make it possible to calibrate the model. In practice, the many parameters might also be the main weakness, since this complicates the calibration. At the end of the paper, proposals to coefficients are presented based on a Danish SP-analysis. This demonstrated the applicability of the method. "

An explanation is proposed that instead gives a prominent role to the psychological processes of ambivalence and attribution, operating together with normal mechanisms of appetite control, the hedonic effects of certain foods, and socially and culturally determined perceptions of appropriate intakes and uses of those foods. Ambivalence (e.g., “nice but naughty”) about foods such as chocolate arises from the attitude that it is highly palatable but should be eaten with restraint. Attempts to restrict intake, however, cause the desire for chocolate to become more salient, an experience that is then labelled as a craving. This, together with a need to provide a reason for why resisting eating chocolate is difficult and sometimes fails, can, in turn, lead the individual to an explanation in terms of addiction (e.g., “chocoholism”). Moreishness (“causing a desire for more”) occurs during, rather than preceding, an eating episode, and is experienced when the eater attempts to limit consumption before appetite for the food has been sated.

One of the main fundamental problems yet unsolved in fibrotic tissues is the origin of the chronic activation of myofibroblasts within these tissues.

In this context, fibrosis could be defined as a wound where continuous signals for tissue repair are emitted. Cytokines and growth factors probably play a central role in this process. Among them, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is considered as a master switch for the fibrotic program. This review discusses recent evidence on the critical role played by TGF-β in the initiation, development, and persistence of radiation fibrosis. It summarizes the results concerning this factor after irradiation of various tissues and cells, with an emphasis on superficial fibrosis, including skin and subcutaneous tissues. Finally, recent data concerning the treatment of established fibrotic disorders of various etiology are presented, as well as the possible mechanisms involved in fibrosis regression, which show that the TGF-β pathway may constitute a specific target for antifibrotic agents.

Synaptic density was the same in homogenotypic cultures of NCAM-deficient and wild-type neurons as well as in heterogenotypic cocultures in which glutamate receptors were blocked.

The discussion is organized around several basic questions regarding the manner in which interconnections within and between the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal formation and involving the glutamate, \{GABA\} and dopamine systems may contribute to the pathophysiology of this disorder. The answers to these questions are used to derive several conclusions regarding circuitry changes in schizophrenia: 1) Schizophrenia is not a `typical' degenerative disorder, but rather it is one in which excitotoxicity may contribute to neuronal pathology, whether or not cell death occurs; 2) Three or more neurotransmitter systems may be simultaneously altered within a single microcircuit; 3) Each transmitter system may show circuitry changes in more than one region, but such changes may vary on a region-by-region basis; 4) The pathophysiology of schizophrenia may involve `mis-wirings' in intrinsic circuits (microcircuitry) within a given region, but significant changes are probably also present at the level of interconnections between two or more regions within a network (macrocircuitry); 5) While some microscopic findings appear to be selectively present in schizophrenia and be related to a susceptibility gene for this disorder, others may also be present in patients with bipolar disorder; 6) Although some of the circuitry changes seen in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder seem to be associated with neuroleptic exposure, most are not and may reflect the influence of non-specific environmental factors such as pre- and/or postnatal stress; 7) Normal postnatal changes at the level of both macro- and microcircuitry within the limbic system may serve as `triggers' for the onset of schizophrenia during adolescence. Taken together, these emerging principles can provide a framework for future postmortem studies of schizophrenic brain. "

A salient characteristic of this problem is that the performance of each heat exchanger decreases with time and can then be restored to its initial state by performing cleaning operations. Due to the cyclic nature of the schedule, some operations may span successive cycles (wrap-around) which is taken into account in the mathematical model. A tight mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is presented which is solved to global optimality. A detailed objective function is used to account for cleaning cost and energy requirements. The formulations can model serial and parallel HENs, as well as network arrangements arising from the combination of these basic cases. The optimization algorithm determines simultaneously: (i) the number of cleaning operations required along with their corresponding timings and (ii) the optimal utility utilization profile over time. A complex heat exchanger network example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. "

Ultimately, arachidonic acid is metabolized into proinflammatory eicosanoids via the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes, both of which we show to be required for Aβ vasoactivity. Accordingly, p38 \{MAPK\} activity is higher in the brains of transgenic mice that overproduce Aβ, and COX-2 immunoreactivity is increased in the cerebrovasculature of these transgenic animals.

In a third set of analyses we use confirmatory techniques to test specific aging hypotheses. These results indicate support for both the “general memory loss” hypothesis and the “general slowing” hypothesis, provide some support for the “investment theory” at the adult level, and also suggest a single “general” factor does not describe the complexity of cognitive aging.

Coccidiosis is an intestinal infection caused by intracellular protozoan parasites belonging to several different species of Eimeria. Infection with coccidia parasites seriously impairs the growth and feed utilization of chickens and costs the \{US\} poultry industry more than $1.5 billion in annual losses. Although acquired immunity to Eimeria develops following natural infection, due to the complex life cycle and intricate host immune response to Eimeria, vaccine development has been difficult and a better understanding of the basic immunobiology of pertinent host–parasite interactions is necessary for developing effective immunological control strategies against coccidiosis. Chickens infected with Eimeria produce parasite specific antibodies in both the circulation and mucosal secretions but humoral immunity plays only a minor role in protection against this disease. Rather, recent evidence implicates cell-mediated immunity as the major factor conferring resistance to coccidiosis. This review will summarize current understanding of the avian intestinal immune system and its response to Eimeria as well as provide a conceptual overview of the complex molecular and cellular events involved in intestinal immunity to coccidiosis. It is anticipated that increased knowledge of the interaction between parasites and host immunity will stimulate the birth of novel immunological and molecular biological concepts in the control of intestinal parasitism.

The nearly saturated atmospheric column in conjunction with light upper-level winds resulted in a “warm rain” process convective storm with little net motion. On the evening of 28 July over 200 mm of rain fell in western Fort Collins. This extreme rainstorm was observed by three S-band weather radars, including two National Weather Service WSR-88D radars and the dual-polarization CSU-CHILL radar. Fourteen recording rain gages in and near the affected area recorded the event. The \{US\} Geological Survey, Colorado District, performed indirect peak discharge measurements. In our analysis, the two-dimensional, physically-based hydrologic model \{CASC2D\} is applied to examine the influence of rainfall and land surface data uncertainty on runoff predictions in the 25 km2 Spring Creek watershed. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity values are calibrated in simulations of the rise in nearby Horsetooth Reservoir. Results of simulations driven by polarimetric and single-polarization radar-rainfall estimates and recording rain gage data show that for this extreme event in an urbanized watershed, rainfall estimation errors give rise to the most significant errors in runoff predictions. Hydrologic simulations with various levels of land-surface detail reveal that uncertainty in watershed characteristics has a considerably smaller effect on runoff predictions than uncertainty in the space/time distribution of rainfall. The soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, fraction of impervious area, and the retention depth are the most sensitive land-surface parameters. "

abstract = {The treatment of diseases and the correction of physiological decline in elderly patients requires a detailed understanding of the aging process. Molecular, cellular, and systemic changes, and particularly hormonal changes, during the life span of the organism are influenced by the environment and by genetics.2,9 The physiological decline of an organism and the presence of molecular disease result from suboptimal functioning of homeostatic systems.17 As it ages, an organism becomes more vulnerable to changes in the environment. This vulnerability probably develops because the systems that are functioning suboptimally are unable to protect the organism and, in some cases, cause additional challenges (Fig. 1). For example, the use of energy by the mitochondria is much more efficient in young people than in the elderly; this inefficiency creates opportunity for further damage, 40 whereas younger cells have a significant capacity to resist environmental stress. This article reviews some aspects of the molecular and cellular bases of aging and the relationship of aging with cancer. One of the important issues for clinicians trying to prevent the decline of an aging patient is how to modify the genetics or the environment to retard or reverse the aging phenomena. Programmed cell death is of importance for the function of numerous tissues, and this review analyzes the systems that maintain the balance of control between cell growth and cell death in an organism. This analysis leads to a consideration of the importance of endocrine factors during aging. The article examines molecular, cellular, and hormonal aging and their relationship to carcinogenesis in aging patients. The key to understanding aging is to define the molecular events that control cell growth and cell death.1,3,7,9,16,17,18,39,40 The cellular and molecular events that orchestrate and regulate the manner in which cells grow and develop are the most visible causes of decline in aging. Key among these causes is the capacity of the cell to correct molecular damage to its genetic material. The deleterious consequences of \{DNA\} damage in mammalian systems, including mutation, cancer, lethality, and some aspects of aging are examined (Fig. 1). Most physical and chemical carcinogens interact primarily with DNA, and the aging cell lacks the capacity to correct the damage in time to avoid decline (Fig. 1). Fortunately, mammalian organisms are diploid and this diploidy gives them the capacity to buffer and correct genetic damage. Other environmental challenges to cell growth include the development of modified proteins either by direct chemical modification or by gene expression.2,5 For example, proteins degrade and cross-link, somatic mutations accumulate, and the capacity of the cellular machinery to deal with the folding pathways and protein partnerships is exceeded as the organism ages.5 The life spans of animals are genetically controlled, and new data indicate that common mechanisms control the number of times a cell will divide before it can no longer divide (senescence).16,17,47 Different species have different aging rates and life spans and, mutations can cause different aging rates and life spans within the same species. This review discusses two classes of genes that affect the aging rates: those that directly affect intracellular mechanisms, such as the repair of DNA, and those that systemically regulate life span, such as hormones.

Field relationships show that channels multiplied and were enlarged as each peat (organogenic marsh) was rapidly transgressed, replaced by, and buried beneath silt (mineralogenic marsh). The networks infilled and shrank as the silt marsh later gave way regressively to the next peat marsh. Simulation and hydraulic models show that this cycle depended on an increase followed by a decrease in the tidal prism imposed on the marsh during a sea-level fluctuation. Coupled patterns of channel width, downstream orientation and coarseness of fill suggest that the many networks tied to the final Flandrian peat–silt couplet (Cycle III) ranged inland from a marsh-edge lying of the order of 2 km seaward from the modern coast.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may mediate this response. Here, we present data on the localization of \{VEGF\} in the rat brain cortex during postnatal development and its correlation to vascularization. We reared newborn rats under normoxic conditions and in hypoxic chambers (FiO2 9.5%), removed them at postnatal days (P) 3, 8, 13, 24, and 33 and prepared the cortical brain tissue for immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization (ISH), Western blot analyses and vessel density counting. When compared to age-matched controls, hypoxic-reared animals displayed a significant increase in platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) protein levels, cerebral microvascular lumen diameter and number and density of vessels (number of capillaries per area). In control animals, \{ISH\} and immunohistochemistry revealed that localization of \{VEGF\} is restricted almost exclusively to cortical neurons at early stages of development. As the vascular bed begins to stabilize, predominant \{VEGF\} expression switches to maturing glial cells which invest vessels while neuronal expression is reduced to a basal level. In hypoxic animals, early localization of \{VEGF\} is also restricted to cortical neurons, however, during later developmental stages, glial cells express elevated levels of \{VEGF\} protein and high neuronal expression also persists. Thus chronic sublethal hypoxia disrupts the temporal–spatial expression of VEGF, which correlates with continuing hypoxia-driven angiogenesis. "

The functional and anatomical characteristics summarized in the chapter demonstrate a strong correspondence of the lamina I projection system with clinical and imaging observations in humans. These characteristics indicate that the fundamental role of the lamina I projection system is to distribute modality-selective sensory information on the physiological status of the tissues of the body to a hierarchical network of sensory and homeostatic substrates involved in the maintenance and preservation of the integrity (or well-being) of the organism. Pain and temperature are functionally and anatomically intimately related because they inform the central nervous system about the condition of the tissues of the body. The lamina I projection system can be viewed as a set of ascending pathways that subserve enteroception, the sense of the condition (or health) of the body. The concept that both pain and temperature sensibilities are specific aspects of integrative enteroception provides a global perspective for understanding the integrative nature of pain and a new basis for understanding the clinical syndrome of post-stroke central pain.

The Pfl phage system described in the chapter is an ideal method for obtaining a tunable degree of alignment of \{RNA\} and \{DNA\} oligomers and some proteins in solution, which then allows the measurement of homonuclear and heteronuclear dipolar coupling interactions. The Pfl filamentous phage system is ideally suited for obtaining a tunable degree of alignment in \{RNA\} and \{DNA\} molecules and acidic proteins for the observation of dipolar couplings. The phage particles are fully aligned at magnetic fields as low as 300 \{MHz\} and are stable indefinitely at a range of temperatures and buffer conditions. These dipolar couplings provide long-range structural information that is presently unavailable by standard solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques; therefore, in the future, dipolar coupling data may prove to be as indispensable as 1H–1H nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) in the solution structure determinations of macromolecules. This should be especially true for structure determinations of \{RNA\} and \{DNA\} oligomers where the low density of protons compared to proteins leads to fewer useful \{NOE\} distance constraints, and therefore generally less well-defined structures. In addition, the current solution \{NMR\} techniques are generally unable to determine global structural features, such as bending in nucleic acids, due because of the local nature of the \{NOE\} distance constraints.

abstract = {To dissect the chemical basis for interactions controlling regulatory properties of macromolecular assemblies, it is essential to explore experimentally the linkage between ligand binding, conformational change, and subunit assembly. There are many advantages to using techniques that will probe the occupancy of individual binding sites or monitor conformational responses of individual residues, as described here. Proteolytic footprinting titrations may be used to infer binding free energies for ligands interacting with multiple sites or domains and to detect otherwise unrecognized “silent” interdomain interactions. Microgram quantities of pure protein are required, which is low relative to the hundreds of milligrams needed for comparable discontinuous equilibrium titrations monitored by NMR.21 By running comparative studies with several proteases, it is easy to determine whether resulting titration curves are consistent, independent of the protease used and therefore representative of the structural response of the protein to ligand binding or other differences in solution conditions (pH, salt, temperature). The results from multiple techniques (e.g., NMR, fluorescence, and footprinting) applied to aliquots from the same discontinuous titration may be compared easily to test for consistency. Classic methods for determining thermodynamic and kinetic properties of calcium binding to calmodulin include filter binding and equilibrium or flow dialysis (employing the isotope 45Ca), spectroscopic studies of stopped-flow fluorescence, calorimetry, and direct ion titrations. A cautionary note is that many different sets of microscopic data would be consistent with a single set of macroscopic constants determined by classic methods. This was well illustrated in Fig. 9. Thus, while it is important to compare results with those obtained by classic binding methods, they are, by definition, incapable of resolving the microscopic constants of interest. Thus, there is only one “direction” for comparison. Quantitative proteolytic footprinting titrations applied to studying calmodulin provided the first direct quantitative estimate of negative interactions between domains. Although studies of site-knockout mutants had suggested interactions between domains, this approach gave the first evidence for the pathway of anticooperative interactions between domains by showing that helix B responds structurally to calcium binding to sites \{III\} and \{IV\} in the C-domain. Despite two decades of study of calmodulin and the application of limited proteolysis studies to the apo and fully saturated forms, this finding emerged only when titration studies were undertaken as described. This highlights the general observation that while the behavior of the intermediate states in a cooperative switch are the key elements of the transition mechanism, they are the most difficult to observe. The unexpected finding that the isolated domains are nearly equivalent in their calcium-binding properties (Fig. 23 B) leaves us with many of the questions we had at the start: How does the sum of two nearly equivalent domains result in a molecule that switches sequentially rather than simultaneously? But it underscores why it is not yet possible to understand similar proteins by sequence gazing alone. "

Most \{MAP\} kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways channel various extracellular or intracellular stimuli and activate signal transmission from membrane receptors to intracellular targets, thus generating specific cellular responses. Currently, investigators studying plant \{MAP\} kinase signaling pathways benefit greatly from the advances made in other model organisms.

A functional, anatomical model of defense behavior in animals is presented and applications are described in cognitive and physiological studies of human affect. It is proposed that unpleasant emotions depend on the activation of an evolutionarily primitive subcortical circuit, including the amygdala and the neural structures to which it projects. This motivational system mediates specific autonomic (e.g., heart rate change) and somatic reflexes (e.g., startle change) that originally promoted survival in dangerous conditions. These same response patterns are illustrated in humans, as they process objective, memorial, and media stimuli. Furthermore, it is shown how variations in the neural circuit and its outputs may separately characterize cue-specific fear (as in specific phobia) and more generalized anxiety. Finally, again emphasizing links between the animal and human data, we focus on special, attentional features of emotional processing: The automaticity of fear reactions, hyper-reactivity to minimal threat-cues, and evidence that the physiological responses in fear may be independent of slower, language-based appraisal processes.

The first part of the paper will outline current debates around the complex interaction of the local and the global in culture in general and the popular music industry in particular. Alongside the continuous expansion of globalisation has been a reassertion of `place', of `locality'. Whilst this has been investigated to some extent at the level of local music scenes it has never been fully addressed in terms of music industry policy as part of an economic development strategy. Yet it is here that the particular values of `place' are asserted in the face of some `global' music industry with a view to developing (or at least retaining some of the benefits of) a local music industry. Whilst situating itself within these debates about the relationship of local and global musical production and consumption, the paper explores the different strategies of two northern English cities and their attempts to promote culture, and music, within each cities `cultural quarter': Sheffield's Cultural Industries Quarter and Manchester's Northern Quarter. The paper analyses the role and appropriateness of local authority policy intervention, the importance of `soft' networks within local music scenes and the different ways in which authorities in each example have tried to overcome dichotomies of art and industry, cultural and economy.

abstract = {We report here the characterization of the Drosophila homolog of the onecut homeobox gene, which encodes a protein product with one cut domain and one homeodomain. We present evidence that D-Onecut can bind to similar \{DNA\} sequences with high specificity and affinity as other Onecut proteins through the highly conserved cut domain and homeodomain. Interestingly, the cut domain alone can mediate DNA-binding, but the homeodomain cannot. However, depending upon the promoter context, we observed cooperative interactions between the two domains to confer high DNA-binding affinity and specificity. D-Onecut appears to be a moderate transcriptional activator and functions as a nuclear protein in neuronal tissues of both the \{CNS\} and \{PNS\} during development and in the adult. In the eye, D-Onecut expression is independent of glass, a transcriptional regulator of R cell differentiation. Taken together, our results suggest a role for D-Onecut in the regulation of some aspects of neural differentiation or maintenance. In support of this notion, overexpression of a putative dominant negative form of D-Onecut during eye development does not affect early cell fate specification, but severely affects photoreceptor differentiation.

Field data are often difficult to analyze because they exhibit complex patterns of behavior. The problem is even more complex when one has to deal with fractured porous media. In this paper we describe a new hybrid approach to comprehensive characterization of FSPM, development of accurate fine-grid geological models for them, and their upscaling. First, we describe the fractal approach to analyzing the porosity logs, the permeability distributions, and other properties of FSPM. We show that an accurate and efficient method of analyzing such data is provided by wavelet transformations. These transformations can also be used for the analysis of the patterns of fracture networks of FSPM, and processing of seismic data, and therefore they provide a unified approach to the treatment of practically all types of data for FSPM. We then propose a fractal neural network that can recognize fractal data and construct accurate correlations for estimating those properties of \{FSPM\} for which the data are scarce, e.g., their permeability distribution. Next, the results of the fractal-wavelet neural-network model are combined with stochastic conditional simulations to generate an accurate geological (fine-grid) model for FSPM, including their fracture network. A wavelet transformation method is then described for upscaling of the geological model of FSPM. Thus, one has a unified approach to reservoir characterization and modeling in which three key concepts play prominent roles: fractal analysis, wavelet transformations, and fractal neural networks.

Drawing on empirical evidence from Wales between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, the paper focuses on the role of societal interaction and conflict (in its widest sense) in promoting these changes. In the context of the state-making process, the author suggests that we should explore the uneven geographies of distributive and collective power that exist at the interface between two societies and which lead to changes in methods of governance within the lesser developed society. With respect to group senses of identity, the author stresses the need to explore the role of processes of othering that were occurring during the period. The author then continues to present a modified version of the argument which is more attuned to the complex political geographies of the medieval period. The paper concludes by arguing that much may be gained from a more theoretical conceptualisation of the processes of societal interaction that led to changes in governance and group senses of identity in the Middle Ages.

Their focus on shareholders and managers provided a starting point for the subsequent development of agency theory such that this relationship has come to dominate capital markets research and policy, to the virtual exclusion of parallel issues involving other parties. Berle and Means' omission of the role of investment funds led them to conclude that the separation of ownership from control problems was located between shareholders and company managers. We document the inaccuracy of this conclusion using historical and contemporary \{US\} evidence and contemporary evidence for Germany, Japan, South Africa, and Canada. In contrast to Berle and Means, we find that investment fund influence and control over companies is pervasive and probably a common characteristic of modern capital markets. Our analysis shows how viewing the capital markets setting from a richer, two-tier perspective involving investors, investment managers, and company managers results in quite different and better perspectives on financial reporting issues, particularly in terms of company reporting to funds, and fund reporting to investors. Consequently, we suggest that our understanding of capital markets may be improved by studying and portraying more diverse types of parties and their relationships than just managers and owners. This perspective subsumes the single-tier principal-agent model and allows multiple relationships to be portrayed and studied. "

Each operon is regulated by cognate LysR-type transcriptional activators, CbbRI and CbbRII, with the product of the cbbRI gene, CbbRI, able to control its own transcription under some growth conditions. Furthermore, CbbRI may at least partially regulate the cbbII operon, with significant, yet regulated transcription of the cbbII operon occurring in the absence of any CbbR. These results suggested the importance of additional regulators. Thus, in addition to the rather specific control exerted by CbbR, a more globally significant regulatory system, the RegA-RegB (PrrA-PrrB) two-component system, was found to contribute to transcriptional regulation of each cbb operon. The regA and regB mutant strains were found to contain constitutive levels of form I and form \{II\} RubisCO, the major proteins encoded by the cbbI and cbbII operons, respectively. In addition, \{DNaseI\} footprint analyses indicated that RegA∗, a constitutively active mutant form of RegA, binds specifically to cbbI and cbbII promoter-operator regions. CbbRI, CbbRII, and RegA binding loci were localized relative to transcription start sites, leading to a coherent picture of how each of these regulators interacts with specific promoter-operator sequences of the cbb operons.

We have generated a mouse strain with a targeted 90-kb deletion within the HoxB cluster from Hoxb1 to Hoxb9. Surprisingly, heterozygous mice show no detectable abnormalities. Homozygous mutant embryos survive to term and exhibit an ordered series of one-segment anterior homeotic transformations along the cervical and thoracic vertebral column and defects in sternum morphogenesis. Neurofilament staining indicates abnormalities in the \{IXth\} cranial nerve. Notably, simultaneous deletion of Hoxb1 to Hoxb9 resulted in the sum of phenotypes of single HoxB gene mutants. Although a higher penetrance is observed, no synergistic or new phenotypes were observed, except for the loss of ventral curvature at the cervicothoracic boundary of the vertebral column. Although Hoxb13, the most 5′ gene, is separated from the rest by 70 kb, it has been suggested to be expressed with temporal and spatial colinearity. Here, we show that the expression pattern of Hoxb13 is not affected by the targeted deletion of the other 9 genes Thus, Hoxb13 expression seems to be independent of the deleted region, suggesting that its expression pattern could be achieved independent of the colinear pattern of the cluster or by a regulatory element located 5′ of Hoxb9.

We consider locks at both vertex (page) and key level (tuple) to further increase concurrency. As undo-based recovery is not possible with multi-level transactions, we use compensation-based undo to achieve atomicity.

In vertebrates, it appears e.g. in serum, hemopoietic cells, liver, lung, heart, at cholinergic synapses, in the central nervous system, in tumors and not at least (besides acetylcholinesterase, AChE) in developing embryonic tissues. Here, a functional role of \{BChE\} can be found in regulation of cell proliferation and the onset of differentiation during early neuronal development — independent of its enzymatic activity. For studies concerning this point, we have established a strategy for a specific and efficient inhibition of \{BChE\} to investigate how the expected decrease of enzyme and, therefore, the manipulation of cellular cholinesterase-equilibrium influences embryonic neurogenesis — among others to gain information about the significance of noncholinergic, activity-independent and cell growth functions of BChE. The antisense-5′BChE-DNA strategy is based on inhibition of \{BChE\} mRNA transcription and protein synthesis. For this, the \{BChE\} gene is cloned into a suitable vector system; this is done in antisense-orientation, so that a transfected cell will produce their own antisense mRNA to inhibit gene expression. For such investigations in neurogenesis, the developing retina is a good model and we are able to create organotypic, three-dimensional retinal aggregates in vitro (retinospheroids) using isolated retinal cells of 6-day-old chicken embryos. Using this in vitro retina and “knock out” of \{BChE\} gene expression, we could show a key role of \{BChE\} during neurogenesis. The results are of great interest because in tumorigenesis and some neuronal disorders, the \{BChE\} gene is amplified or abnormally expressed. It has to be discussed how the antisense-5′BChE strategy can play a role in the development of new and efficient therapy forms. "

These analogies include, for example, (a) red-square:red-circle∷yellow-square:?, (b) apple:red∷banana: ?, (c) a:b∷c:?. Underlying the development of this network is a theory for how the brain learns the nature of association between pairs of concepts. Traditional Hebbian learning of associations is necessary for this process but not sufficient. This is because it simply says, for example, that the concepts “apple” and “red” have been associated, but says nothing about the nature of this relationship. The types of context-dependent interlevel connections in the network suggest a semilocal type of learning that in some manner involves association among more than two nodes or neurons at once. Such connections have been called synaptic triads, and related to potential cell responses in the prefrontal cortex. Some additional types of connections are suggested by the problem of modeling analogies. These types of connections have not yet been verified by brain imaging, but the work herein suggests that they may occur and, possibly, be made and broken quickly in the course of working memory encoding. These working memory connections are referred to as differential, delayed and anti-Hebbian connections. In these connections, one can learn transitions such as “keep red the same”; “change red to yellow”; “turn off red”; “turn on yellow,” and so forth. Also, included in the network is a kind of weight transport so that, for example, red to red can be transported to a different instance of color, such as yellow to yellow. The network instantiation developed here, based on common connectionist building blocks such as associative learning, competition, and adaptive resonance, along with additional principles suggested by analogy data, is a step toward a theory of interactions among several brain areas to develop and learn meaningful relationships between concepts.

Primary consumers include mesozooplankton, macrozooplankton and jellyfish, while the fish community consists of anchovy, pilchard, lanternfish, gobies, horse mackerel, hake, snoek, benthic feeding fish and other carnivorous fish. The top consumers are seabirds and seals. The primary production–zooplankton–pelagic fish–demersal fish energy flow pathway appears to dominate in this system, with jellyfish, pilchard and horse mackerel being the most important planktivores. Jellyfish appears to be an important component in the system due to its high biomass and consumption of about 10% of the primary production. Hake is the most important secondary consumer.

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses osmotic effects on \{DNA\} conformation, \{DNA\} activity, and the cell cycle with emphasis on their interdependent relationship and adaptive value during osmotic stress. Osmotic stress has multiple effects on \{DNA\} conformation and \{DNA\} activity in all biological kingdoms. An important part of the cellular response to osmotic stress is the regulation of the cell cycle, which is closely linked to \{DNA\} conformation and \{DNA\} activity. For a better understanding of the osmosensory signal transduction networks that control \{DNA\} activity and the cell cycle during osmotic stress, it is needed to identify more of the elements and mechanisms that determine the ways in which cells respond to changes in osmolality. Important questions that remain to be answered concern the interplay between signaling mechanisms necessary for cell cycle delay, cellular repair, and apoptosis in response to osmotic stress. Given the complex interactions between osmo-protective mechanisms and cell cycle regulation, integrative approaches to study cellular adaptation during osmotic stress will be instrumental for identifying the mechanisms that hold the key for the outcome of the cellular osmotic stress response. Approaches based on proteomics and gene chip technology should provide significant insight into these mechanisms in the future. "

The activation function of CRE-binding proteins is modulated by phosphorylation by several kinases and is mediated by coactivators such as \{CBP\} and p300. Activation might also be independent of \{CBP\} and phosphorylation in some specific cell types, such as male germ cells, wherein the protein \{ACT\} confers a powerful activation function to CREM. The inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) protein is the only inducible member of this family. The induction of this powerful repressor is likely to be important for the transient nature of cAMP-induced gene expression.

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses that all living organisms depend on precise regulation of complex patterns of gene transcription. Remarkably, the same basic transcriptional machinery is responsible for producing the immense diversity of \{RNA\} transcripts at a variety of defined levels. Therefore, in order to satisfy the requirement for specific and timely gene expression, it is necessary for this machinery to be sensitive to an abundance of regulatory mechanisms. As a means of directing spatial and temporal specificity, transcription factors frequently require the assistance of additional protein or nucleic acid components, all of which assemble along with the transcription factor into a transcriptional regulatory complex. The dependence of a transcription factor on cis-acting nucleic acid components directs the sequence specificity of this regulation, and dependence on trans-acting protein components can control the timing and intensity of a regulatory response. The chapter uses basic kinetic and thermodynamic principles to discuss how a transcription complex can achieve a state that is sensitive to regulation. It presents a working model for the assembly of a specific regulatory complex. The method involves addressing quantitatively the individual contributions of accessory factors and defining them as “layers of specificity.” Finally, to provide a set of concrete illustrations of these principles, it describes physicochemical and molecular biological studies of the mechanisms whereby the N protein-dependent antitermination system activates the delayed early genes of bacteriophage λ.

Surgical resection of hepatic lobes or hepatocyte loss caused by viral or chemical injury triggers hepatocyte replication while enlarged liver mass is corrected by apoptosis. Hepatocytes have a great replicative capacity and are capable of repopulating the liver. However, “stem-like” cells proliferate when hepatocyte replication is blocked or delayed. Detailed studies of the mechanisms that regulate liver growth have been done in animals subjected to partial hepatectomy or chemical injury. Substantial progress has been achieved using appropriate transgenic and knockout mouse models for this work. Gene expression in the regenerating liver can be divided into several phases, starting with expression of a large number of immediate early genes. Hepatocytes need to be primed before they can fully respond to the growth factors \{HGF\} (Hepatocyte Growth Factor), TGFα (Transforming Growth Factor Alpha), and \{EGF\} (Epidermal Growth Factor) in vitro. Priming requires the cytokines \{TNF\} and IL-6 in addition to other agents that prevent cytotoxicity. Reactive Oxygen Species and glutathione content can determine whether the \{TNF\} effect on hepatocytes is proliferative or apoptotic. At least four transcription factors, NFκB, \{STAT3\} (which are strongly induced by TNF), AP-1 and C/EBPβ play major roles in the initiation of liver regeneration. In addition, extensive remodeling of the hepatic extracellular matrix occurs shortly after partial hepatectomy. Progression through the cell cycle beyond the initiation phase requires growth factors. The expression of Cyclin \{D1\} probably establishes the stage at which replication becomes growth factor-independent and autonomous. Knowledge about the mechanisms of liver regeneration can now be applied to correct clinical problems caused by deficient liver growth. "

One of the more successful approaches to study \{P450\} function involves molecular modeling. Because none of the mammalian \{P450s\} have been crystallized, a number of homology models have been constructed based on the structures of known bacterial P450s. Molecular models, generated using molecular replacement or distance geometry methods, can be used to dock substrates and/or inhibitors in the active site to explain various aspects of enzyme function. The majority of modeling research has dealt with enzyme-substrate interactions in the active site. The analysis of these interactions has helped us to better understand the mechanism of \{P450\} catalysis and provided the structural basis for the regio- and stereospecificity of substrate oxidation as well as susceptibility to inhibition or inactivation. The models have been utilized to identify and/or confirm key residues and to rationally interpret experimental data. The alteration in activity in a mutant \{P450\} can be related to changes in enzyme-substrate/inhibitor interactions, such as the removal or appearance of van der Waals overlaps or changes in compound mobility. Homology models can also help to analyze P450-redox partner interactions and identify critical determinants of protein stability. We can expect further development of molecular modeling methods and their increasing contribution into research on \{P450\} function as an integral part of a combined theoretical-experimental approach.

The distinct patterns of connectivity of the accumbens core and shell and structures related to them by connections are described. Multiple inputs, outputs and abundant reciprocity of connections within the ventral parts of the basal ganglia are emphasized and the implications for “through-put” of impulses is considered. It is noted, at least on neuroanatomical grounds, that there is ample reason to expect feed forward processing from shell and structures with which it is associated to core and structures with which it is associated. Furthermore, the potential for additional feed forward processing involving several forebrain functional anatomical systems, inlcuding the ventral striatopallidum, extended amygdala and magnocellular basal forebrain complex is considered. It is intended that from the considerations recorded here a conceptual framework will begin to emerge that is amenable to further experimental substantiation as regards how multiple basal forebrain systems and the cortices to which they are related by connections work together to fashion a unitary object—the adaptive response.

The coherent activity in corticothalamic networks, under the control of brainstem and forebrain modulatory systems, requires investigations in intact-brain animals. During behavioral states associated with brain disconnection from the external world, the large-scale synchronization of low-frequency oscillations is accompanied by the inhibition of synaptic transmission through thalamocortical neurons. Despite the coherent oscillatory activity, on the functional side there is dissociation between the thalamus and neocortex during slow-wave sleep. While dorsal thalamic neurons undergo inhibitory processes due to the prolonged spike-bursts of thalamic reticular neurons, the cortex displays, periodically, a rich spontaneous activity and preserves the capacity to process internally generated signals that dominate the state of sleep. In vivo experiments using simultaneous intracellular recordings from thalamic and cortical neurons show that short-term plasticity processes occur after prolonged and rhythmic spike-bursts fired by thalamic and cortical neurons during slow-wave sleep oscillations. This may serve to support resonant phenomena and reorganize corticothalamic circuitry, determine which synaptic modifications, formed during the waking state, are to be consolidated and generate a peculiar kind of dreaming mentation. In contrast to the long-range coherent oscillations that occur at low frequencies during slow-wave sleep, the sustained fast oscillations that characterize alert states are synchronized over restricted territories and are associated with discrete and differentiated patterns of conscious events.

In xylanases that function optimally under acidic conditions, this residue is aspartic acid, whereas it is asparagine in those that function under more alkaline conditions. Previous studies of wild-type (WT) Bacillus circulans xylanase (BCX), with an asparagine residue at position 35, demonstrated that its pH-dependent activity follows the ionization states of the nucleophile Glu78 (pKa4.6) and the acid/base catalyst Glu172 (pKa6.7). As predicted from sequence comparisons, substitution of this asparagine residue with an aspartic acid residue (N35D BCX) shifts its pH optimum from 5.7 to 4.6, with an ∼20 % increase in activity. The bell-shaped pH-activity profile of this mutant enzyme follows apparent pKa values of 3.5 and 5.8. Based on 13C-NMR titrations, the predominant pKa values of its active-site carboxyl groups are 3.7 (Asp35), 5.7 (Glu78) and 8.4 (Glu172). Thus, in contrast to the \{WT\} enzyme, the pH-activity profile of \{N35D\} \{BCX\} appears to be set by Asp35 and Glu78. Mutational, kinetic, and structural studies of \{N35D\} BCX, both in its native and covalently modified 2-fluoro-xylobiosyl glycosyl-enzyme intermediate states, reveal that the xylanase still follows a double-displacement mechanism with Glu78 serving as the nucleophile. We therefore propose that Asp35 and Glu172 function together as the general acid/base catalyst, and that \{N35D\} \{BCX\} exhibits a “reverse protonation” mechanism in which it is catalytically active when Asp35, with the lower pKa, is protonated, while Glu78, with the higher pKa, is deprotonated. This implies that the mutant enzyme must have an inherent catalytic efficiency at least 100-fold higher than that of the parental WT, because only ∼1 % of its population is in the correct ionization state for catalysis at its pH optimum. The increased efficiency of \{N35D\} BCX, and by inference all “acidic” family 11 xylanases, is attributed to the formation of a short (2.7 Å) hydrogen bond between Asp35 and Glu172, observed in the crystal structure of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate of this enzyme, that will substantially stabilize the transition state for glycosyl transfer. Such a mechanism may be much more commonly employed than is generally realized, necessitating careful analysis of the pH-dependence of enzymatic catalysis. "

abstract = {This fifth paper in the series on Ecosystems Emerging treats the properties of ecosystem growth and development from the perspective of open (paper four), nonequilibrium, thermodynamic systems. The treatment is nonrigorous and intuitive, interpreting results for living ecosystems based on parallels between these and the much simpler nonliving ones treated rigorously in thermodynamic theory. If an (open, nonequilibrium) ecosystem receives a boundary flow of energy from its environment, it will use what it can of this energy, the free energy or exergy content, to do work. The work will generate internal flows, leading to storage and cycling of matter, energy, and information, which move the system further from equilibrium. This is reflected in decreased internal entropy and increased internal organization. Energy degraded in the performance of work is exhausted as boundary outputs to the system's environment. This is reflected in decreased organization and increased entropy of the surroundings, the dissipative property (paper three). All properties rest on the conservation principle (paper two). Growth is movement away from equilibrium, which occurs in three forms: (I) when there is a simple positive balance of boundary inputs over outputs, which increments storage; (II) when, with boundary inputs fixed, the ratio of internal to boundary flows increases, which reflects increase in the sum of internal flows, which contribute to throughflow; and (III) when, somewhat coincident with but mostly following upon I and II, system internal organization, reflecting its energy-use machinery, evolves the utilization of information to increase the usefulness for work of the boundary energy supply. These three forms of growth are, respectively, growth-to-storage, growth-to-throughflow, and growth-to-organization. Forms I and \{II\} are quantitative and objective, concerned with brute energy and matter of different kinds. Form \{III\} has qualitative and subjective attributes inherent in information-based mechanisms that increase the exergy/energy ratio in available energy supplies. The open question of this paper is, which of many possible pathways will an ecosystem take in realizing its three forms of growth? The answer given is that an ecosystem will change in directions that most consistently create additional capacity and opportunity to utilize and dissipate available energy and so achieve increasing deviation from thermodynamic ground. The machinery for this synthesized from the three identified growth processes is reflected in a single measure, exergy storage. Abundant and diverse living biomass represents abundant and diverse departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and both are captured in this parameter. It is the working hypothesis of this paper that ecosystems continually maximize their storage of free energy at all stages in their integrated existence. If multiple growth pathways are offered from a given starting state, those producing greatest exergy storage will tend to be selected, for these in turn require greatest energy dissipation to establish and maintain, consistent with the second law. Energy storage by itself is not sufficient, but it is the increase in specific exergy, that is, of exergy/energy ratios, that reflects improved usability, and this represents the increasing capacity to do the work required for living systems to continuously evolve new adaptive ‘technologies’ to meet their changing environments. Exergy cannot be found for entire ecosystems as these are too complex to yield knowledge of all contributing elements. But it is possible to compute an exergy index for models of ecosystems that can serve as relative indicators. How to compute this index is shown, together with its use in developing models with time-varying parameters. It is also shown how maximization of exergy storage distinguishes between local and global optimization criteria. In ecological succession, energy storage in early stages is dominated by Form I growth which builds structure; the dominant mechanisms are increasing energy capture (boundary inputs) and low entropy production (dissipative boundary outputs). In middle stages, growing interconnection of proliferating storage units (organisms) increases energy throughflow (Form \{II\} growth). This increases endogenous inputs and outputs and, in consequence, throughflow/boundary flow ratios, entropy production, and on balance, biomass. In mature phases, cycling becomes a dominant feature of the internal network, increasing storage and throughflow both. Biomass and entropy production are maximal, but specific dissipation (as dissipation/storage ratio) decreases, reflecting advanced organization (Form \{III\} growth) typified by cycling. Specific exergy (exergy/energy ratio) increases throughout succession to maturity, in early stages mainly due to mass accrual, and in the later stages to gains in information and organization. During senescence, storage, entropy production, specific dissipation, and specific exergy all decrease, reflecting a declining ecosystem returning toward equilibrium. "

While the regime for the oceans is commonly viewed within the context of a general, universal convention for the law of the sea, the contemporary scope of global oceans law extends far beyond that single instrument. Indeed, the law of the sea is broad, far-reaching and reflective of the increasingly complex, interdependent nature of contemporary international relations. In this regard, by end of the 20th century there has emerged a pronounced trend toward worldwide participation in and adherence to the multifaceted legal regime established to manage the oceans. This panorama of legal instruments focuses both on international instruments and regional accords. The study's premise is this: Since 1958 several multilateral agreements have been negotiated and implemented specifically to regulate various uses of ocean space. Viewed as an integrated whole, these agreements comprise at the beginning of the 21st century an intertwined, sophisticated international legal regime for managing ocean activities. The range of agreements discussed here, however, is neither exhaustive nor meant to suggest that sufficient law is available for regulating all activities affecting the oceans now or in the future. Rather, the survey furnishes a starting point for appreciating just how far the international community has come in establishing a legal regime for managing people and their technological activities that impact on ocean space.

abstract = {Publisher Summary The function of smooth muscle, in its wide variety of physiological roles in the body, requires the changing of metabolic energy into mechanical effects. The study of the means by which smooth muscle cells and tissues interact physically with the internal and external environments is the field of muscle mechanics. Although the mechanical roles of smooth muscle are many and varied, their study can be organized, guided, and simplified by using the paradigm provided by years of study of skeletal muscle. This chapter first presents the terminology, functional relationships, and standard experimental approaches that have arisen largely through the study of skeletal muscle. After treating the technical requirements for making reliable and adequate mechanical measurements of smooth muscle function, specific features of the mechanics of smooth muscle are discussed, comparing and contrasting them with the mechanical properties of skeletal muscle and pointing out the special features unique to smooth muscle. The current state of knowledge in the field is briefly surveyed, and areas of current concern and importance are highlighted. "

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, \{DNA\} transactions such as replication, repair, and transcription require a large set of proteins. In all of these events, complexes of more than 30 polypetides appear to function in highly organized and structurally well-defined machines. We have learned in the past few years that the three essential macromolecular events, replication, repair, and transcription, have common functional entities and are coordinated by complex regulatory mechanisms. This can be documented for replication and repair, for replication and checkpoint control, and for replication and cell cycle control, as well as for replication and transcription. In this review we cover the three different protein classes: \{DNA\} polymerases, \{DNA\} polymerase accessory proteins, and selected transcription factors. The “common enzyme-different pathway strategy” is fascinating from several points of view: first, it might guarantee that these events are coordinated; second, it can be viewed from an evolutionary angle; and third, this strategy might provide cells with backup mechanisms for essential physiological tasks.

abstract = {Publisher Summary A protein kinase is only rigorously defined when its \{DNA\} and/or amino acid sequence is established. Therefore, the most logical method is to classify them on the basis of the similarities in amino acid sequences. Protein kinases can be classified by various biochemical criteria, such as by their substrate specificity or their regulatory properties. However, an inherent problem with a purely biochemical approach is the difficulty in comparing results obtained by different laboratories, especially when different species or tissues are used; it is often difficult to know whether the protein kinases under study correspond to the same molecular entities. Animal and yeast protein kinases provide good models for the functions of plant systems, particularly where they appear to be homologues. This approach has validity because the more the insight gained into signal transduction pathways, the earlier they appear to have evolved and the more conserved they appear to be. "

We have emphasized the complexities of adult tendon and ligament cell shape and related these to their early development. The importance of gap junctions in allowing cell communication throughout an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) has also been highlighted, particularly in relation to understanding how tendon and ligament cells respond to changes in mechanical load.

abstract = {Publisher Summary Social ontogeny is described as one component of the general process of ontogeny that refers explicitly and only to the development of an individual. It deals more specifically with the development of behaviors and cognitive abilities necessary for an individual to live in an organized social milieu. Because these aspects of individual development occur within a social group, social ontogeny results in a complex interplay between the individual maturational factors, other genetic factors, and environmental influences, especially those of social partners. Everyone in a group participates in a certain way in the social ontogeny of a new member. This chapter discusses the different approaches that were and are still used to deal with the issue of social development. Some of these approaches are purely descriptive, as in the univariate approach, whereas others attempt to determine the interactive aspects of social development, such as in the index approach. Different new multivariate approaches are also presented as attempts to determine the influences of some of the variables. These multivariate approaches were exemplified with the studies on social ontogeny of gray-cheeked mangabeys and rhesus macaques. They mainly considered two fundamental processes in social ontogeny: (1) building a social behavioral repertoire and (2) building a network of social relationships. "

My summary points are three: (1) Research and theory will better cumulate across studies if we focus on the network mechanisms responsible for social capital effects rather than trying to integrate across metaphors of social capital loosely tied to distant empirical indicators. (2) There is an impressive diversity of empirical evidence showing that social capital is more a function of brokerage across structural holes than closure within a network, but there are contingency factors. (3) The two leading network mechanisms can be brought together in a productive way within a more general model of social capital. Structural holes are the source of value added, but network closure can be essential to realizing the value buried in the holes. "
