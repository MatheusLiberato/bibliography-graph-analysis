abstract = {Large complex networks occur in many applications of computer science. The complex network zeta function and the graph surface function have been used to characterize these networks and to define a dimension for complex networks. In this work we present three new results related to the complex network dimension. First, we show the relationship of the concept to Kolmogorov complexity. Second, we show how the definition of complex network dimension can be reformulated by defining the concept for a single node, and then defining the complex network dimension as the supremum over all nodes. This makes the concept work better for formally infinite graphs. Third, we study interesting parallels to zeta dimension, a notion originally from number theory which has found connections to theoretical computer science. These parallels lead to a deeper insight into the complex network dimension, e.g., the formulation in terms of the entropy and a theorem relating dimension to connectivity.}}

The effects of control parameters on synchronization speed and time are also analyzed. The results of this paper are applicable to both directed and undirected weighted networks while do not need to know any information about eigenvalues of coupling matrix. Since finite-time synchronization means the optimality in convergence time and has better robustness and disturbance rejection properties, the results of this paper are important.

Based on this event, and real observations of the complex network changes, an algorithm is proposed in which evolution of a network is accomplished using preferential and random attachments of edges, while the number of nodes is fixed. Evolution of clustering coefficients and number of edges display similar patterns observed in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities. Distinguishing the contact profiles and their changes, despite the former case, disclosed growing networks, which can shed light on the details of changes within intra-topology of profiles.}}

Complex networks involving proteins of the chitin metabolic pathway in extant organisms were constructed based on protein sequence similarity. Several usual network indices were estimated in order to obtain information on the topology of these networks, including those related to higher order neighborhood properties. Due to the assumed evolutionary character of the system, we also discuss issues related to modularity properties, with the concept of edge betweenness playing a particularly important role in our analysis. Complex network approach correctly identifies clusters of organisms that belong to phylogenetic groups without any a priori knowledge about the biological features of the investigated protein sequences. We envisage the prospect of using such a complex network approach as a high-throughput phylogenetic method.}}

The data replica is copied to the node with the minimum local cost in the two pools. Further, this paper presents and proves a replica creation theorem. A dynamic multi-replicas creation algorithm (DMRC) is also provided. Simulation results show that the proposed method may simultaneously reduce makespan and data used in space storage consumption.}}

Furthermore, evaluating the correlations between these inherited measures and classical measures of centralities such as the degree of a node and the characteristic path length of a node, we have found two classes of results. While for the London rapid transit rail, these inherited measures can be easily explained by these classical measures of centrality, for the Boston underground transportation system we have found nontrivial results.}}

For instance, let G(p, q) be a graph obtained from two cliques, Kp and Kq(p â©¾ q â©¾ 3), joined by a single edge. It is apparent that this graph contains two communities, namely the two cliques. However, Estrada and Hatanoâ€™s algorithm detects only Kq as a community when p is sufficiently larger than q. Our algorithm correctly detects both communities. Also, our method also finds the correct community structure in one of the classic benchmark networks, the Zachary karate club.}}

By employing a new Lyapunov functional candidate, we utilize some stochastic analysis techniques and Kronecker product to deduce delay-dependent synchronization criteria that ensure the mean-square synchronization of the proposed Tâ€“S fuzzy \{SDCNs\} with mixed time-varying delays. These sufficient conditions are computationally efficient as it can be solved numerically by the \{LMI\} toolbox in Matlab. A numerical simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed approach.}}

Compared with the time series of standard Brownian motion, we found that the dynamics of the original series can be identified, but the return series has the similar topology with a random one. Moreover, in the scale-free networks from original series, the small-world property is detected and the time interval distribution between connected pairs decays as an exponential function, which implies that nodes correlated with a given one appear in a Poisson process.}}

Two synchronization criteria are presented; the first is easy to satisfy with simple limitation and the second relaxes the previous limitation and can be executed only by adding a simple linear feedback control to every node. As a special case, projective synchronization in a \{DRCN\} without time delay is analyzed by using a different method. The corresponding synchronization criterion is given, which can be realized by adopting single-node adaptive control. This paper extends previous work, where the nodes of the \{DRCN\} are partially linear, there is limitation of the coupling matrix or the scale factors of the nodes are all equal. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization criteria. Due to the complexity of the different scale factors, we select the chaotic data from the \{DRCN\} presented in this paper and apply the data selected in image encryption. Simulation results show that our method is efficient with a large key space, high sensitivity to initial conditions and high speed.}}

Viral marketing actually uses a pre-existing social network where, however, the scale of the pre-existing network is believed to be so large and so random, so that its theoretical analysis is intractable and unmanageable. There are very few reports in the literature on how to design a spreading scheme for viral marketing on real social networks according to the traditional marketing theory or the relatively new network marketing theory. Complex network theory provides a new model for the study of large-scale complex systems, using the latest developments of graph theory and computing techniques. From this perspective, the present paper extends the complex network theory and modeling into the research of general viral marketing and develops a specific spreading scheme for viral marking and an approach to design the scheme based on a real complex network on the \{QQ\} instant messaging system. This approach is shown to be rather universal and can be further extended to the design of various spreading schemes for viral marketing based on different instant messaging systems.}}

To show the usefulness of this approach in practice, we also carry out numerical simulations on some concrete complex networks. Our results are completely consistent with the previous conclusions derived by graph theory methods. Furthermore, we show that the first excited state appears always on the largest connected component of the network. The relationship between the first excited energy and the average shortest path length in networks is also discussed.}}

The algorithm runs in O ( n + m ) time for a general network and O ( n ) for a sparse network, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in a network. The algorithm fast produces the desired results when applied to search for communities in a benchmark and five classical real-world networks, which are widely used to test algorithms of community detection in the complex network.

To understand and predict very large networks it is important to study the possibility of parallel simulation. We consider a class of stochastic processes which keeps the number of edges in the network constant called equilibrium networks. This class is characterized by a preferential selection where the edge destinations are chosen according to a preferential function f(k) which depends on the node degree k. For this class of stochastic processes we prove that it is difficult if not impossible to design an exact parallel algorithm if the function f(k) is monotonous with an injective derivative. However, in the important case where f(k) is linear we present a fully scalable algorithm with almost linear speedup. The experimental results confirm the linear scalability on a large processor cluster.}}

We prove exact relations among the thus defined node displacement, the information centrality and the Kirchhoff index. The relation between the first two suggests that the node displacement has a better resolution of the vulnerability than the information centrality, because the latter is the sum of the local node displacement and the node displacement averaged over the entire network.}}

Herein, we characterize the developing network structure and loss of connectivity in a quasistatically deforming granular medium from the perspective of complex networks. Attention is paid to the evolution of the contact and contact force networks at the local or mesoscopic level, i.e., a particle and its immediate neighbors, as well as the macroscopic level. We explore network motifs and other topological properties at these multiple length scales, in an attempt to find that which best correlates with the constitutive properties of nonaffine deformation and dissipation, spatially and with respect to strain. Key processes or rearrangement events that cause loss of connectivity within the material domain, e.g. microbanding and force chain buckling, are investigated. Network statistics of these processes, previously shown to be major sources of energy dissipation and nonaffine deformation, are then tied to corresponding trends observed in the evolving macroscopic network. It is shown that consideration of the unweighted contact network alone is insufficient to tie dissipation to loss of material connectivity.}}

Several synchronization criteria are presented to guarantee the convergence of the pinning process locally and globally by construction of Lyapunov functions. In particular, if a pinning strategy has been designed for synchronization of a given complex dynamical network, then no matter what uncertainties occur among the pinned nodes, synchronization can still be guaranteed through the pinning. The analytical results show that pinning control has a certain robustness against perturbations on network architecture: adding, deleting and changing the weights of edges. Numerical simulations illustrated by scale-free complex networks verify the theoretical results above-acquired.}}

abstract = {Prevailing models of the evolutionary prisonerâ€™s game on networks always assume that agents are pursuing their own profit maximization. But the results from experimental games show that many agents have other-regarding preference. In this paper, we study the emergence of cooperation from the prisonerâ€™s dilemma game on complex networks while some agents exhibit other-regarding preference such as inequality aversion, envious and guilty emotions. Contrary to common ideas, the simulation results show that the existence of inequality aversion agents does not promote cooperation emergence on a \{BA\} (BarabÃ¡si and Albert) scale-free network in most situations. If the defection attraction is big and agents exhibit strong preference for inequality aversion, the frequency of cooperators will be lower than in situations where no inequality aversion agents exist. In some cases, the existence of the inequality agents will even induce the frequency of cooperators to zero, a feature which is not observed in previous research on the prisonerâ€™s dilemma game when the underlying interaction topology is a \{BA\} scale-free network. This means that if an agent cares about equality too much, it will be difficult for cooperation to emerge and the frequency of cooperators will be low on \{BA\} networks. The research on the effect of envy or guilty emotions on the emergence of cooperation in the prisonerâ€™s dilemma game on \{BA\} networks obtains similar results, though some differences exist. However, simulation results on a \{WS\} (Watts and Strogatz) small-world network display another scenario. If agents care about the inequality of agents very much, the \{WS\} network favors cooperation emergence in the prisonersâ€™ dilemma game when other-regarding agents exist. If the agent weight on other-regarding is lowered, the cooperation frequencies emerging on a \{WS\} network are not much different from those in situations without other-regarding agents, although the frequency of cooperators is lower than those of the situation without other-regarding preference agents sometimes. All the simulation results imply that inequality aversion and its variations can have important effects on cooperation emergence in the prisonerâ€™s dilemma game, and different network topologies have different effects on cooperation emergence in the prisonerâ€™s dilemma game played on complex networks.}}

Here we show that investors can overcome this complexity and globally minimize risk in portfolio models for any given expected return, provided the margin requirement remains below a critical, empirically measurable value. In practice, for markets with centrally regulated margin requirements, a rational stabilization strategy would be keeping margins small enough. This result follows from ground states of the random field spin glass Ising model that can be calculated exactly through convex optimization when relative spin coupling is limited by the norm of the networkâ€™s Laplacian matrix. In that regime, this novel approach is robust to noise in empirical data and may be also broadly relevant to complex networks with frustrated interactions that are studied throughout scientific fields.}}

Collective behavior of agents interacting over complex networks is important in many applications. The cooperation between selfish individuals is one of the most interesting collective phenomena. In this paper we address the interplay between the motifsâ€™ cooperation properties and their abundance in a number of real-world networks including yeast proteinâ€“protein interaction, human brain, protein structure, email communication, dolphinsâ€™ social interaction, Zachary karate club and Net-science coauthorship networks. First, the amount of cooperativity for all possible undirected subgraphs with three to six nodes is calculated. To this end, the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma game is considered and the cooperativity of each subgraph is calculated as the percentage of cooperating agents at the end of the simulation time. Then, the three- to six-node motifs are extracted for each network. The significance of the abundance of a motif, represented by a Z -value, is obtained by comparing them with some properly randomized versions of the original network. We found that there is always a group of motifs showing a significant inverse correlation between their cooperativity amount and Z -value, i.e. the more the Z -value the less the amount of cooperativity. This suggests that networks composed of well-structured units do not have good cooperativity properties.}}

The derived stability condition indicates that the smallest real part of eigenvalues of the Laplacian sub-matrix corresponding to the unpinned vertices can be used to measure the stabilizability of a digraph with a given pinned vertex set. A pinned vertex set can stabilize a directed network to some unstable trajectories, for instance, to a chaotic trajectory of the uncoupled systems, if and only if the pinned vertex set can access all other vertices in the digraph. Furthermore, in the bigraph case, the analytical estimation of the stabilizabilityâ€™s lower bound suggests that an optimal pinning strategy should take not only the vertex degree, but also the shortest path between pairs of vertices into considerations.}}

Based on this equivalence, we develop a new algorithm, named the so-called SNMF-SS, by combining \{SNMF\} and a semi-supervised clustering approach. Previous NMF-based algorithms often suffer from the restriction of measuring network topology from only one perspective, but our algorithm uses a semi-supervised mechanism to get rid of the restriction. The algorithm is illustrated and compared with spectral clustering and \{NMF\} by using artificial examples and other classic real world networks. Experimental results show the significance of the proposed approach, particularly, in the cases when community structure is obscure.}}

When a zooming out strategy is applied new matrix functions are introduced, which give a more global picture of the topological surrounds of a node. These indices permit a modulation of the scales at which the environment of a node influences its centrality. We apply them to the study of 10 proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) networks. We illustrate the similarities and differences between the generalized subgraph centrality indices as well as among them and some classical centrality measures. We show here that the use of centrality indices based on the zooming in strategy identifies a larger number of essential proteins in the yeast \{PPI\} network than any of the other centrality measures studied.}}

However, if the network consists of large numbers of genes and interactions, the oscillation generator is deeply hidden in the complicated interactions. We apply the dominant phase-advanced driving path method proposed in Qian et al. (2010) [1] to reduce complex genomic regulatory networks to one-dimensional and unidirectionally linked network graphs where negative regulatory loops are explored to play as the central generators of the oscillations, and oscillation propagation pathways in the complex networks are clearly shown by tree branches radiating from the loops.

Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic continues to grow in an exponential form and has evident seasonal fluctuations.

Methods Seventy-nine patients with either abnormal sputum cytology or lung cancer were entered into the study. First, high-resolution bronchovideoscopy with white light was performed. Observations were repeated using \{NBI\} light to examine microvascular structures in the bronchial mucosa. Spectral features of the \{RGB\} (red/green/blue) sequential videoscope system were changed from a conventional \{RGB\} filter to the new \{NBI\} filter. The wavelength ranges of the \{NBI\} filter were: 400â€“430 nm (blue), 400â€“430 nm (green) and 520â€“560 nm (red). Results The following were clearly observed with \{NBI\} with high-resolution bronchovideoscopy: increased vessel growth and complex networks of tortuous vessels of various sizes, in squamous dysplasia; some dotted vessels, in addition to increased vessel growth and complex networks of tortuous vessels, in ASD; several dotted vessels and spiral or screw type tumor vessels of various sizes and grades, in SCC.

We explain our results showing that for the disassortative case the clusters in the gradient network turn out to be as much elongated as possible, reducing the pressure congestion J and observing the opposite behavior for the assortative case.

We conjecture that preserving the universal network properties is a necessary step in artificial composition of music. Power-law exponents of node degree, node strength and/or edge weight distributions, mean degrees, clustering coefficients, mean geodesic distances, etc. are reported. With the network constructed, music can be composed artificially using a controlled random walk algorithm, which begins with a randomly chosen note and selects the subsequent notes according to a simple set of rules that compares the weights of the edges, weights of the nodes, and/or the degrees of nodes. By generating a large number of compositions, we find that this algorithm generates music which has the necessary qualities to be subjectively judged as appealing.}}

We report that all networks based on connecting stocks of highly correlated stock prices, price returns and trading volumes, display a scalefree degree distribution. The results from this work clearly suggest that the variation of stock prices are strongly influenced by a relatively small number of stocks.

In particular, both segregation and integration of information have to be dealt with in a single architecture of brain networks. There is strong evidence that synchronization of neural activity, both locally and between distant regions is a crucial code for functional interactions. However, a powerful theoretical framework to describe the structural and functional topology of system-wide brain networks has only become available with the discovery of â€˜small-worldâ€™ and â€˜scale-freeâ€™ networks in 1998 and 1999. There is now strong evidence that brain networks, ranging from simple nets of interconnected neurons up to macroscopic networks of brain areas display the typical features of complex systems: high clustering, short path lengths (both typical of â€˜small-worldâ€™ networks), skewed degree distributions, presence of hubs, assortative mixing and the presence of modules. This has been demonstrated for anatomical and functional networks using neuroanatomical techniques, EEG, \{MEG\} and structural and functional MRI, in organisms ranging from C. elegans to man. In addition, network topology has been shown to be highly heritable, and very predictive of cognitive functioning. A short path length, which implies that from any area in the brain any other area can be reached in a small number of steps, is strongly correlated with IQ. Computational models are now beginning to reveal how the complex structure of adult brain networks could arise during development.}}

Here we employ susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) models described in terms of ordinary differential equations and probabilistic cellular automata in order to investigate how the deletion of links in the random complex network representing the social contacts among individuals affects the dynamics of a contagious disease. The inspiration for this study comes from recent discussions about the impact of measures usually recommended by health public organizations for preventing the propagation of the swine influenza A (H1N1) virus.

Recognition of cell wall components by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induces intracellular signalling pathways that culminate in the activation of pro-inflammatory genes through nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB). Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±) is one of the earliest mediators produced and induces a second wave of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that orchestrate the immune response. The magnitude of this response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia is a complex network and many factors must be considered in the analysis of the cytokine production pattern. First, bacterial growth and the inflammatory response are dynamic processes, produced initially as a local phenomenon with a late systemic extension. Second, host characteristics, such as different cytokine gene polymorphisms, can cause a distinct immune response. Finally, other microorganism determinants and even the immunomodulatory effect of antimicrobials may play a role in cytokine production. Recent data on innate immunity against Streptococcus pneumoniae gathered from the murine model of pneumonia, from studies of human genetic polymorphisms associated with increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infection, and from human clinical trials are discussed. Special emphasis has been placed on the description of the chronology of the complex network of innate immunity triggered by pneumococcal infection.}}

Given the fact that a Brownian particle from a high-degree node often needs a large number of steps to reach an expected low-degree node, which is the bottleneck for a single random walk, we propose a mixing search model to improve the efficiency of search processes by using random walks from multiple sources to continue the searches from high-degree nodes to destinations. We compare our model with the mixing navigation model proposed by Zhou on complex networks and find that our model converges much faster with lower hardware cost than Zhouâ€™s model. Moreover, simulations on scale-free networks show that the search efficiency of our model is much higher than that of a single random walk, and comparable to that of multiple random walks which have much higher hardware cost than our model. Finally, we discuss the traffic cost of our model, and propose an absorption strategy for our model to recover the additional walkers in networks. Simulations indicate that this strategy reduces the traffic cost of our model effectively.}}

By taking the auxiliary-system approach and using the Lyapunov function method, we prove that for any given initial coupling strengths, the generalized synchronization can take place in complex networks consisting of nonidentical dynamical systems. It is demonstrated that the coupling strengths are affected by topologies of the networks. Furthermore, it is found that there are hierarchical features in the processes of generalized synchronization in scale-free networks because of their highly heterogeneous distributions of connection degree. Finally, we discuss in detail how a networkâ€™s degree of heterogeneity affects its generalization synchronization behavior.}}

Our model assumes that agents may initially display low fairness behavior, and therefore, may have to learn and develop their own strategies in this unknown environment. The Genetic Algorithm Learning Classifier System (GALCS) is used in the model as the agent strategy learning rule. Aside from the Wattsâ€“Strogatz (WS) small-world network and its variations, the present paper also extends the spatial ultimatum game to the BarabÃ¡siâ€“Albert (BA) scale-free network. Simulation results show that the fairness level achieved is lower than in situations where agents have complete information about other agentsâ€™ strategies. The research results display that fairness behavior will always emerge regardless of the distribution of the initial strategies. If the strategies are randomly distributed on the network, then the long-term agent fairness levels achieved are very close given unchanged learning parameters. Neighborhood size also has little effect on the fairness level attained. The simulation results also imply that \{WS\} small-world and \{BA\} scale-free networks have different effects on the spatial ultimatum game. In ultimatum game on networks with incomplete information, the \{WS\} small-world network and its variations favor the emergence of fairness behavior slightly more than the \{BA\} network where agents are heterogeneously structured.}}

Meanwhile, a pinning scheme deciding which nodes need to be pinned and a simply approximate formula for estimating the least number of pinned nodes are also provided.

abstract = {With the ever growing usage of peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, more and more \{P2P\} applications emerge on Internet. Based on purely distributed architecture of basic P2P, many new architecture and strategies are developed to improve quality of experience (QoE) of \{P2P\} applications. Peer to server and peer (P2SP) architecture is used by Thunder, while \{UUSee\} combines content delivery network (CDN) and \{P2P\} architecture. Understanding the characteristics of different \{P2P\} architectures is important for service provisioning and network optimization. In this paper, based on a large sample of flow data collected from operational network, we study overlay topology properties of different \{P2P\} applications from complex network perspective, including BT, Thunder, and UUSee. The overlay topology is modeled as a weighted directed graph, and degree distribution, reachability and PageRank distribution are analyzed. Analysis results show different characteristics of \{P2P\} applications, which indicate different quality of experience.}}

This is followed by a dynamic analysis of the information diffusion process within the case destination demonstrating that stakeholder cohesion and adaptive capacity have a positive effect on information diffusion.

We contribute a complex weighted network analysis of travel routes on the Singapore rail and bus transportation systems. We study the two networks using both topological and dynamical analyses. Our results provide additional evidence that a dynamical study adds to the information gained by traditional topological analysis, providing a richer view of complex weighted networks. For example, while initial topological measures showed that the rail network is almost fully connected, dynamical measures highlighted hub nodes that experience disproportionately large traffic. The dynamical assortativity of the bus networks also differed from its topological counterpart. In addition, inspection of the weighted eigenvector centralities highlighted a significant difference in traffic flows for both networks during weekdays and weekends, suggesting the importance of adding a temporal perspective missing from many previous studies.}}

( 3 , r ) and ( 4 , r ) networks are respectively constructed from 14 different irrational numbers and their topological properties are examined. By observation, we find that network topologies change with different values of d , r and even sequence length M instead of the types of irrational numbers, although they share some similar features with traditional random graphs. We make a further investigation to explain these interesting phenomena and propose the identical-degree random graph model. The results presented in this paper provide some insight into distributions of irrational number digits that may help better understanding of the nature of irrational numbers.}}

Extensive numerical simulations show that correlations between the native frequencies of adjacent oscillators on the network systematically shift the critical point as well as the critical exponents characterizing the transition. Negative correlations imply an onset of synchronization for smaller coupling, whereas positive correlations shift the critical coupling towards larger interaction strengths. For negatively correlated oscillators the transition still exhibits critical behaviour similar to that of the all-to-all coupled Kuramoto system, while positive correlations change the universality class of the transition depending on the correlation strength. Crucially, the paper demonstrates that the synchronization behaviour is not only determined by the coupling architecture, but also strongly influenced by the oscillator placement on the coupling network.}}

abstract = {Prevalence of cooperation within groups of selfish individuals is puzzling in that it contradicts with the basic premise of natural selection, whereby we introduce a model of strategy evolution taking place on evolving networks based on Darwinian â€˜survival of the fittestâ€™ rule. In the present work, players whose payoffs are below a certain threshold will be deleted and the same number of new nodes will be added to the network to maintain the constant system size. Furthermore, the networking effect is also studied via implementing simulations on four typical network structures. Numerical results show that cooperators can obtain the biggest boost if the elimination threshold is fine-tuned. Notably, this coevolutionary rule drives the initial networks to evolve into statistically stationary states with a broad-scale degree distribution. Our results may provide many more insights for understanding the coevolution of strategy and network topology under the mechanism of nature selection whereby superior individuals will prosper and inferior ones be eliminated.}}

Interestingly, for certain networks of relatively large randomness, the neuron firings can achieve the best temporal coherence at an optimal potassium CB.

The distance is an important parameter in CCAN, that is, the number of flights decays fast with the increasing of the distance. In comparison, the tertiary industry has the most important influence on the Chinese air passenger transportation. Statistically speaking, when the tertiary industry value increases by 1%, the next periodâ€™s volume will increase by 0.73%.}}

The 31 parameters were calculated based on the amino acid networks of the folding proteins. The relationship between those parameters and protein folding rates has been systematically analyzed. Our results show that the significant parameters between two-state and multi-state folding proteins correlate well with the folding rates of proteins. It is also found that classifying the proteins into different classes can improve the correlation coefficient from 0.926 to 0.983 between the parameters and folding rates of two- and multi-state proteins, respectively. Genetic Algorithmsâ€“Multiple Linear Regression (GAâ€“MLR) was adopted to select the best subset parameters from the whole 31 parameters to construct the \{MLR\} model to avoid over-fitting. Our methods show a correlation coefficient of 0.921 for the all folding proteins based on the classification of the folding proteins. The results indicate that the general topological parameters of the amino acids networks of the folding proteins can effectively represent the structural and functional properties, such as the rates of folding.}}

With comparison to standard random graph and scale-free networks, our result indicates that the robust yet fragile property in the cascading failure scenario is mainly related to heterogeneous betweenness, rather than the network degree distribution.

The performances of this strategy on scale-free networks which have the same degree distribution and different degree correlations are compared to one another. Our numerical simulations confirm that this routing strategy is more effective than the shortest path based strategy on scale-free networks with any degree correlations and that the performance of our strategy on assortative scale-free networks is better than that on disassortative and uncorrelated scale-free networks.}}

In contrast with previous results, we find that a different heterogeneity parameter domain range imposes an entirely different impact on the cooperation fraction. In the parameter range corresponding to networks with extremely high heterogeneity, the decrease in heterogeneity greatly promotes the proportion of cooperation strategy, while in the remaining parameter range, which relates to relatively homogeneous networks, the variation of heterogeneity barely affects the cooperation fraction. Also our study provides a detailed insight into the microscopic factors that contribute to the performance of cooperation frequency.}}

The strain evolution of three classes of subnetworks, i.e., k-cores, minimal cycles and force chain networks, elucidates the breakdown of functional connectivity and structure in the lead up to and during failure. Feature vectors and dynamics occurring in such networks in three different biaxially compressed two-dimensional samples reveal some common aspects which are suggestive of an intrinsic structural hierarchy in granular networks â€“ while differences shed light on the influence of confining pressure and interparticle rolling resistance on the evolution of these networks both at the mesoscopic as well as macroscopic levels.}}

abstract = {Summary Endocrine system has been considered to be a linear one, but the â€˜real world endocrine systemâ€™ is a complex system, which is difficult to investigate using conventional strategies, such as single nucleotide polymorphism, genome-wide analysis, or gene targeting in animals. Here we propose a new strategy to comprehend the endocrine system as a complex network system. We introduced several novel concepts, such as complex system, network analysis, systems biology and evolutionary medicine, into the comprehension of endocrine system as a whole complex network system. This system is considered to be a scale-free network with key molecules such as acetyl CoA, \{NAD\} or \{ATP\} as â€˜hubsâ€™. This system is robust against simple mutations, but various complex diseases may attack hubs. The system is also â€˜fractalsâ€™, since there exist similar network systems among cells, proteins, and transcription factors in the lower levels, and there are similar ones among disease and social network in the higher levels. We propose to call this model â€˜Integrated Network Systems and Evolutionary \{DEvelopmental\} \{ENdocrinology\} (INS-EDEN)â€™. This novel framework will facilitate us to develop a new approach for understanding and treatment of various complex diseases related to endocrinology, and identify a unified theory of complex diseases.}}

To investigate the effect of power distribution, synchronization is further explored for the power-driven moving agent network. Under the constraint of fast-switching, we theoretically show that synchronization of the agent network is determined by the power density which is independent of both the power distribution and the size of network.

Seven real-world complex networks and one synthetic network are used to evaluate the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed is efficient for detecting overlapping communities in weighted networks.}}

We allow for voluntary participation in the evolutionary \{PDG\} on regular lattices and scale-free networks, and focus on the strategy density and the evolution behavior of the system. Simulation shows that the system behavior is sensitive to the population structure. For lattices, the densities of cooperator, defector and loners exhibit non-trivial behaviors with the increment of Q and temptation parameter b except for the density of loners as a function of Q. For scale-free networks, the densities of cooperator and defectors monotonously decrease with the increment of Q, and the densities of defectors and loners monotonously increase with the increment of b. Moreover, this extension can lead to â€œrock-scissors-paperâ€�-like cyclic dominance of the three types of players on regular lattices. But for scale-free networks, the loners cannot coexist with cooperators or defectors.}}

To assess the impact of such genomic alterations on the structure of signaling networks and on the ability of cells to accurately translate environmental cues into phenotypic changes, we argue studies must be conducted on a network level. Advances in technologies and computational approaches for data integration have permitted network studies of signaling events in both cancer and normal cells.

abstract = {Abstract Replicative senescence forms a major barrier to tumor progression. Cancer cells bypass this by using one of the two known telomere maintenance mechanisms: telomerase or the recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. The molecular details of \{ALT\} are currently poorly understood. We have previously shown that telomerase is actively repressed through complex networks of kinase, gene expression, and chromatin regulation. In this study, we aimed to gain further understanding of the role of kinases in the regulation of telomerase expression in \{ALT\} cells. Using a whole human kinome small interfering \{RNA\} (siRNA) screen, we highlighted 106 kinases whose expression is linked to human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter activity. Network modeling of transcriptional regulation implicated c-Myc as a key regulator of the 106 kinase hits. Given our previous observations of lower c-Myc activity in \{ALT\} cells, we further explored its potential to regulate telomerase expression in ALT. We found increased c-Myc binding at the hTERT promoter in telomerase-positive compared with \{ALT\} cells, although no expression differences in c-Myc, Mad, or Max were observed between \{ALT\} and telomerase-positive cells that could explain decreased c-Myc activity in ALT. Instead, we found increased expression of the c-Myc competitive inhibitor \{TCEAL7\} in \{ALT\} cells and tumors and that alteration of \{TCEAL7\} expression levels in \{ALT\} and telomerase-positive cells affects hTERT expression. Lower c-Myc activity in \{ALT\} may therefore be obtained through \{TCEAL7\} regulation. Thus, \{TCEAL7\} may present an interesting novel target for cancer therapy, which warrants further investigation.}}

The self-incompatibility response is now thought to be based on a phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway that inhibits the secretion of factors required for successful pollination. Because manipulation of the identified signaling intermediates results in only partial disruption of the self-incompatibility reaction, this pathway likely functions in conjunction with other as-yet unidentified signaling pathways to effect complete inhibition of self-pollen.}}

abstract = {Recently, the pinning control of complex dynamical networks to their homogeneous states has been studied by many researchers, most of the dynamical networks are continuous-time ones, i.e., their dynamical behavior can be described by ODEs. An interesting result is that, for a continuous-time network, its desired (homogeneous) state can be achieved by pinning some nodes with relatively large degrees (also called the specifically pinning scheme [Wang XF, Chen GR. Pinning control of scale-free dynamical networks. Physica A 2002;310:521â€“31]). Is this specifically pinning scheme also effective for the discrete-time dynamical networks? In this paper, we demonstrate that the pinning control for a discrete-time dynamical network is difficult, and sometimes it is impossible to achieve the desired state just by controlling the nodes with larger degrees. In order to control the discrete-time dynamical networks successfully, we may need to control all the nodes. Finally, we also consider how to extend the interval for the feedback gain d for successful control.}}

Gene expression is controlled by complex networks of interacting regulators that act through a variety of biochemical mechanisms. Perturbation of these networks can have profound effects on the fitness of organisms. This highlights an important challenge: the investigation of whether the mechanisms and network architectures we observe in Nature evolved in response to selective pressure â€” and, if so, what that pressure might have been â€” or whether the architectures are a result of non-adaptive forces. Synthetic biologists aim to construct artificial genetic and biological systems to increase our understanding of Nature as well as for a number of biotechnological applications.

Whether or not findings of these investigations also apply to networks of small size is still an open question. This is an important gap for many biological applications, including the spread of the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora ramorum in networks of plant nurseries. We use numerical simulations of disease spread and establishment in directed networks of 100 individual nodes at four levels of connectivity. Factors governing epidemic spread are network structure (local, small-world, random, scale-free) and the probabilities of infection persistence in a node and of infection transmission between connected nodes. Epidemic final size at equilibrium varies widely depending on the starting node of infection, although the latter does not affect the threshold condition for spread. The number of links from (out-degree) but not the number of links to (in-degree) the starting node of the epidemic explains a substantial amount of variation in final epidemic size at equilibrium irrespective of the structure of the network. The proportion of variance in epidemic size explained by the out-degree of the starting node increases with the level of connectivity. Targeting highly connected nodes is thus likely to make disease control more effective also in case of small-size populations, a result of relevance not just for the horticultural trade, but for epidemiology in general.}}

Similarly, the activity of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells is increased during hypoxia. Moreover, neurons located in the central nervous system containing catecholamines, serotonin, and histamine are also sensitive to hypoxia. On the basis of this common sensitivity of monoamine-synthesizing cells to changes in oxygenation we propose the hypothesis that these cells constitute a widely distributed network of sensors that monitor oxygen levels. The role of monoamine-synthesizing cells in monitoring tissue oxygen supply during both physiological and pathological conditions is also discussed.}}

Matching the output transmitter impedance to high impedance transducer is important to maximize the transfer of power and improve the transmitting efficiency of the transducer, and so achieve better signal-to-noise ratio. In \{NDT\} ultrasonic applications based on piezoelectric transducers it is usual to introduce a tuned inductor, normally fitted in an experimental way, in order to cancel out the reactive component of the impedance of the transducer. More elaborated tuning solutions are well known, but in systems employing several transducers, such as arrays, is not feasible to connect all the transducer elements via a transformer or a complex network to their transmitters. Therefore, when the number of components is critical, if the system works in a narrow frequency range, this paper proposes to employ a simple L-C matching network with only one inductor and one capacitor. This topology is evaluated, by means of equivalent circuit analysis, computer simulation, and experimental assessment.}}

Comparing with a single plant, a multi-plant enterprise is much more complex considering the high level of inter- and intra-organizational interactions and consequently it is subject to many disruptions. While facing an abnormal situation, many different possible solutions can be defined to mitigate the negative impacts of the disruption and recover the system to its normal operation. Basically, these solutions can be at the plant level or at the enterprise level. To study which solutions are more effective in coping with a disruption, appropriate quantitative models are necessary to evaluate the effect of local behaviors and policies on the overall system performance. In this paper, we will demonstrate how an agent-based model can be used to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a multi-plant enterprise particularly during abnormal situations. Using this model, different mechanisms for coping with abnormality - centralized and decentralized - are also modeled and compared.}}

Our results indicate that homogeneous networks can support a large critical packet generation rate under the congestion-free state, but the networks must be able to sustain relatively heavy packet load pressure if the same packet generation rate is assigned to a more heterogeneous network. At the same time, it is also found that heterogeneous networks can relieve packet load pressure, but the network is likely to become congested due to an abrupt increase of packet loads. We find that when the network size is large, lowering the average number of packet loads and raising the critical packet generation rate need not to be compromised too much. We also point out that networks can be more robust to abrupt increase of packet loads if networks are structured more homogeneously in the process of network size increment.}}

Cytokines are a diverse group of glycopeptides produced rapidly by immune cells in response to tissue injury, infection, or inflammation. Upon binding to specific receptors (Rs), cytokines coordinate the complex network of cellular interactions that regulate cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and the acute phase response. Major advances in the understanding of the regulation of immune responses are the identification of: (1) pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, and interferons (IFNs), (2) cytokines secreted by mutually exclusive populations of T helper (Th) cellsâ€”that is, Th1-like (IFN Î³ and IL-2) versus Th2-like (IL-4 and IL-5), and (3) negative immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² which suppress Th1 effector functions. Cytokines are pleiotropic, as one cytokine can exert many actions, and redundant, as different cytokines can exert the same action; they may also act synergistically. Furthermore cytokines are frequently regulated in cascades where induction of the early cytokines serves to influence the synthesis of later ones.}}

abstract = {Summary Bone accommodates to changes in its functional environment ensuring that sufficient skeletal mass is appropriately positioned to withstand the mechanical loads that result from functional activities. Increasing physical activity will result in increased bone mass, while the removal of functional loading would result in bone loss. Bone is a composite material made up of a collagenâ€“hydroxyapatite matrix and a complex network of lacunaeâ€“canaliculi channels occupied by osteocyte and osteoblast processes, immersed in interstitial fluid. There are strong indications that changes in interstitial fluid flow velocity or pressure are the means by which an external load signal is communicated to the cell. In vitro studies indicate that shear stress, induced by interstitial fluid flow, is a potent bone cell behavior regulator. One of the forms of altering interstitial fluid flow is through the mechanical deformation of skeletal tissue in response to applied loads. Other methods include increased intramedullary pressure, negative-pressure tissue regeneration, or external mechanical stimulation. Analysis of these methods poses the question of process effectiveness. The efficacy of each method theoretically will depend on the mechanical efficiency of transmitting an external load and converting it into changes in interstitial fluid flow. In this paper, we combine recent knowledge on the effect of the boneâ€™s interstitial fluid flow, different fluid patterns, the role of gap junctions, and the concept of mechanical effectiveness of different methods that influence interstitial fluid flow within bone, and we hypothesize that the efficiency of bone remodeling can be improved if a small mechanical percussion device could be placed directly in contact with the bone, thus inducing local interstitial fluid flow variations. Enhancement of bone repair and remodeling through controlled interstitial fluid flow possesses many clinical applications. Further investigations and in vivo experiments are required. Practical methods and clinical apparatuses need to be conceived and developed to validate and facilitate the clinical use of this technique.}}

A recent development has been the demonstration that the regenerative ability of some axons depends on their capacity to locally synthesise new proteins and degrade others at the injury site autonomously from the cell body. There are also events involving the degradation of cytoskeletal and other molecules, and activation of signalling pathways, with axotomy-induced calcium changes probably being an initiating event.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of melatonin in appetite central control analyzing the involvement of this hormone in the regulation of feeding behavior in the zebrafish Danio rerio. For this purpose, the effect of two different melatonin doses (100 nM and 1 Î¼M) administered for 10 days, via water, to zebrafish adults was evaluated at both physiological and molecular level and the effect of melatonin was considered in relation to the most prominent systems involved in appetite regulation. For the first time, in fact, melatonin control of food intake by the modulation of leptin, MC4R, ghrelin, \{NPY\} and \{CB1\} gene expression was evaluated. The results obtained indicate that melatonin significantly reduces food intake and the reduction is in agreement with the changes observed at molecular level. A significant increase in genes codifying for molecules involved in feeding inhibition, such as leptin and MC4R, and a significant reduction in the major orexigenic signals including ghrelin, \{NPY\} and \{CB1\} are showed here. Taken together these results support the idea that melatonin falls fully into the complex network of signals that regulate food intake thus playing a key role in central appetite regulation.}}

It has been observed that in addition to responding to cognate hormones with transcription activation, once hormone bound they are also capable of rapid responses following association with signaling effectors in the extra nuclear compartment. This novel aspect of steroid hormone action could influence our view of the cross talk between growth factor and steroid receptors. Increasing evidence shows that in hormone-responsive cells, a cross talk occurs between growth factors (EGF, IGF-1) and steroid hormone receptors that reciprocally regulate their action. To date, this has mostly been explained by modulation of steroid receptor transcriptional activity through growth factor receptor signaling activation. However, it is now known that growth factors might also act on extra nuclear steroid receptors, activating them via a hormone-independent mechanism. On the other hand, extra nuclear steroid receptors can regulate growth factor receptor activity either directly interfering with their transduction pathways, or inducing autocrine growth factor secretion. Here we discuss findings indicating that EGF, like steroid hormones, induces association of steroid receptors with Src thereby activating pathways that can trigger cell proliferation and migration. Since mammary and prostate cancers respond to both steroid hormones and growth factors, this association might be a putative target for human cancer therapy. Findings from our laboratory supporting this view are discussed.}}

abstract = {Several measures of lipoprotein phenotype are significant predictors of cardiovascular risk. Although such lipoprotein phenotypes are under strong genetic control, it is not clear to what extent they are controlled by the same â€“ and by different â€“ genes and whether these relationships may be altered in different dietary environments. Therefore, we measured six lipoprotein traits (three \{LDL\} traits â€“ \{LDLC\} and apoB concentrations and \{LDL\} size â€“ and three \{HDL\} traits â€“ \{HDLC\} and apoA1 concentrations and \{HDL\} size) on each of three diets differing in level of fat and cholesterol. In bivariate analyses, all but two metabolically related trait pairs were genetically correlated, though none were completely correlated, implying additive genetic effects by both pleiotropic and unique genes. In comparing genetic correlations for the same pair of traits across diet, we detected evidence of diet effects on genetic control of these metabolically related traits; specifically, increasing level of dietary cholesterol was associated with a significant decrease in the genetic correlation of apoA1 with \{HDL\} size, and a significant increase in the genetic correlations of \{LDL\} size with \{LDLC\} and apoB. The results suggest a complex network of genes affecting lipoprotein metabolism: the genes may exert both unique and pleiotropic effects; the genes may exert detectable effects in many or only in specific dietary environments.}}

The \{DFNN\} implements Takagiâ€“Sugenoâ€“Kang fuzzy systems based on extended radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The design procedure is illustrated by using the multiscroll chaotic attractors as an example, on which simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}}

abstract = {Residue networks representing 595 nonhomologous proteins are studied. These networks exhibit universal topological characteristics as they belong to the topological class of modular networks formed by several highly interconnected clusters separated by topological cavities. There are some networks that tend to deviate from this universality. These networks represent small-size proteins having &lt;200 residues. This article explains such differences in terms of the domain structure of these proteins. On the other hand, the topological cavities characterizing proteins residue networks match very well with protein binding sites. This study investigates the effect of the cutoff value used in building the residue network. For small cutoff values,Â &lt;5 Ã…, the cavities found are very large corresponding almost to the whole protein surface. On the contrary, for large cutoff value, &gt;10.0 Ã…, only very large cavities are detected and the networks look very homogeneous. These findings are useful for practical purposes as well as for identifying protein-like complex networks. Finally, this article shows that the main topological class of residue networks is not reproduced by random networks growing according to ErdÃ¶s-RÃ©nyi model or the preferential attachment method of BarabÃ¡si-Albert. However, the Watts-Strogatz model reproduces very well the topological class as well as other topological properties of residue network. A more biologically appealing modification of the Watts-Strogatz model to describe residue networks is proposed.}}

We also classified the most active participants into different groups by their opinions and studied the structural evolution of opposite groups. It was observed that the evolution of nodes in each group were very similar, but the evolution of densities were obviously different. Specifically, we found that the most active participants preferred to converse with those belonging to the opposite groups at the beginning and tended to converse with anybody regardless of group as the discussion network grew.

Furthermore, leaf-like branching networks have been rarely used and discussed. A three-dimensional model was formulated to compare the flow and heat transfer characteristics of symmetric/asymmetric tree-like branching networks and symmetric/asymmetric (offset) leaf-like branching networks. Results show that the influence of the asymmetry is very small for tree-like branching network at low branching number. Offset in leaf-like branching networks can reduce pressure drop significantly while maintaining maximum temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the flowing fluid.}}

When the \{DAP\} hydrogel was formed in aqueous dextran solution with a rather low viscosity, we found that it could be significantly reinforced with respect to its viscoelastic moduli, complex viscosity and hydrogel strength. Moreover, the modified \{DAP\} hydrogel has a higher bound water content. These property changes could be attributed to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between \{DAP\} and dextran. By relating the dynamic rheological data with a scaling model, it was found that native and modified \{DAP\} hydrogels had both a fractal aggregate structure and the incorporation of dextran resulted in an increase of the fractal dimension. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that a more complex network structure was formed in the \{DAP\} hydrogel with dextran.}}

In numerical simulations, synchronized stochastic strategy updating rule based on pairwise comparison for a fixed noise level is adopted. The results show that the high-quality group preference mechanism can greatly improve cooperation, compared with conventional models. Besides, the system with stronger preference toward high-quality groups performs better. Investigation of wealth distribution at equilibrium reveals that cooperatorsâ€™ wealth appreciates with the increase of preference degree when cooperators take up the same fraction of the population.}}

Robust synchronization of \{ICCSNs\} with parametric uncertainties and time-varying delays is investigated. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, delay-independent synchronization conditions for \{ICCSNs\} with uncertainties and delays are obtained. In addition, we consider five special synchronization cases: \{ICCSNs\} with delays in both the linear and nonlinear terms, \{ICCSNs\} with parametric uncertainties and delays either in the linear or in the nonlinear term, \{ICCSNs\} without switching behaviors but with parametric uncertainties and delays, and impulsively-switched-coupled complex switched network with uncertainties and delays. A systematic-design procedure is presented, and a numerical example is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization strategy. A comparative study of the maximum impulsive intervals for synchronization is presented for all special cases.}}

In our system, CABS, information about a machineâ€™s urgency of jobs to fulfill demanded throughput and maintain its utilization is passed to upstream machines in the product routes. Upstream machines utilize this information to identify bottleneck machines and coordinate their actions to provide the bottlenecks with necessary and sufficient jobs for preventing their starvation and congestion.

This review is aimed to underline the new molecular targets in bone metastases management other than bisphosphonates. Different pathways or molecules such as RANK/RANKL/OPG, cathepsin K, endothelin-1, Wnt/DKK1, Src have recently emerged as potential targets and nowadays preclinical and clinical trials are underway. The results from those in the advanced clinical phases are encouraging and underlined the need to design large randomised clinical trials to validate these results in the next future. Targeting the bone by preventing skeletal related events (SREs) and bone metastases has major clinical impact in improving survival in bone metastatic patients and in preventing disease relapse in adjuvant setting.}}

abstract = {We propose a coevolutionary version to investigate the naming game, a model recently introduced to describe how shared vocabulary can emerge and persist spontaneously in communication systems. We base our model on the fact that more popular names have more opportunities to be selected by agents and then spread in the population. A nameâ€™s popularity is concerned with its communication frequency, characterized by its weight coevolving with the name. A tunable parameter governs the influence of name weight. We implement this modified version on both scale-free networks and small-world networks, in which interactions proceed between paired agents by means of the reverse naming game. It is found that there exists an optimal value of the parameter that induces the fastest convergence of the population. This illustration indicates that a moderately strong influence of evolving name weight favors the rapid achievement of final consensus, but very strong influences inhibit the convergence process. The rank-distribution of the final accumulated weights of names qualitatively explains this nontrivial phenomenon. Investigations of some pertinent quantities are also provided, including the time evolution of the number of different names and the success rate, as well as the total memory of agents for different parameter values, which are helpful for better understanding the coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we explore the scaling behavior in the convergence time and conclude a smaller scaling parameter compared to the previous naming game models.}}

abstract = {Chemical genomics is relatively new to plant biology in academia; however, the ability of this approach to present novel discoveries is being demonstrated clearly. One particularly suitable application of this approach is plant endomembrane trafficking. The rapid and dynamic nature of vesicular trafficking plus genetic redundancy has hampered effective study of this complex network. The ability of small molecules to act quickly to inhibit or arrest vesicular trafficking should permit the association of specific vesicles, especially endosome compartments, with their cargoes, particularly those destined for the plasma membrane. This approach and the large target space presented by the endomembrane trafficking network require the discovery of many new bioactive molecules. Advances in high-throughput chemical screening in plants are making this a reality. However, successful chemical genomic approaches in plants must be coupled with improvements in automated microscopy, image analysis, and target identification. In addition, the ability to correlate specific molecules with complex phenotypic data will be crucial. The data obtained from these experiments will be composed of a matrix of intracellular markers displaying complex chemically induced phenotypes as well as whole plant and perhaps data generated by genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. In this manner, it should be possible to view endomembrane trafficking and its interactions as a systems-based network.}}

In this article, Morris explores the cybercrime landscape, and finds out what we could be doing more effectively. For three decades, information security has struggled to contain the evolution of malicious software. Viruses, worms, spyware, rootkits, Trojans and phishing have all enjoyed their reign of terror. The spyware years (2000â€“2003) showed how the security industry was caught off-guard when most of the major security vendors took an agonising two to three years to respond to a new category of threat that affected hundreds of millions of users. Had it not been for the start-up vendors such as Lavasoft, Webroot, Safer Networking and Giant, who quickly plugged a hole for an estimated 250 million \{PC\} users, order may never have been restored. It was a close-run thing. Had organised crime spotted and leveraged the opportunity afforded by sluggish vendors, then the effects would have been catastrophic. Fortunately, spyware at this time was more about exploitation of internet advertising than bank accounts or industrial espionage.}}

This response constitutes a complex regulatory network in which a large number of genes are induced and others are repressed. The stress response is regulated by the alternative sigma factor ÏƒS encoded by the rpoS gene. The rpoS transcripts are substrates of the \{RNA\} binding protein, Hfq, which is essential for its translation. The rpoS mRNA is also a substrate of the cold shock protein C (CspC) which stabilizes the transcripts. Here we demonstrate, using pull-down assays, that CspC interacts with Hfq via mRNA molecules. We also show that CspC acts on the 5â€² \{UTR\} of the rpoS transcript, but its activity on rpoS is independent of Hfq. Moreover, we show that CspC suppresses the phenotypes of an hfq deletion. These results elucidate a new aspect in the post-transcriptional regulation of the stress response and will further our understanding of this complex network.}}

In this work, we collected regulatory interactions between ncRNA molecules and their regulated protein targets. We then constructed the ncRNAâ€“protein interaction network corresponding to six model organisms, including Homo sapiens. The large-scale network analysis of ncRNAâ€“protein interactions revealed a high degree of similarity for the degree distribution to that of the transcription regulatory network. Moreover, characterization of the local interaction structure of these networks based on motifs abundance also reveals significant similarities between ncRNAâ€“protein and TFsâ€“gene regulatory networks. Based on the identified motif abundance, we propose an evolutionary model that rebuilds the degree distribution and predicts the observed degree exponent. Taken together, our findings offer insights into the noncoding RNA-mediated regulation and provide knowledge about its structure and evolutionary mechanisms.}}

Hence, today's software development processes must include systematic approaches to analyze the functional correctness of system specifications and implementations. Model-based testing is of particular importance for embedded software systems as the test cases can be performed at the real system under test and failures arising from the interaction of software and hardware can be discovered. As features are usually designed in a modular and isolated way, unexpected and undesired behavior caused by unintended interferences of insufficiently synchronized and even contradicting features concurrently active in the system often remains undetected which may lead to serious safety problems. To overcome such feature interactions at system integration level is tedious as it leads to a voluminous number of unmanageable test cases. We describe a model-based approach for efficiently generating test cases that particularly aim at feature interaction analysis. We first characterize feature interaction in a formal way based on a rigorous functional architecture model, and describe how to detect potential feature interactions. For test case generation, behavioral models like Statecharts and according coverage criteria can be used as usual, but only those models are integrated into the test model, that contribute to one of the features under consideration. This leads to a trade off between comprehensive test coverage to find possible flaws caused by interacting features, and yet still a reasonable number of test cases. The steps of the approach are illustrated be means of a case study from the automotive domain.}}

Our proposed method uses PageRank random walk induced network embedding to transform a directed network into an undirected one, where the information on edge directions is effectively incorporated into the edge weights. Starting from this new undirected weighted network, previously developed methods for undirected network community finding can be used without any modification. Moreover, our method improves on recent work in terms of community definition and meaning. We provide two simulated examples, a real social network and different sets of power law benchmark networks, to illustrate how our method can correctly detect communities in directed networks.}}

Molecular chaperones, mainly heat shock proteins (HSP) and other stress-inducible proteins abundantly expressed in multiple compartments of the cell, are major modulators of protein homeostasis. \{TRAP1\} is a mitochondrial \{HSP\} involved in protection against oxidant-induced \{DNA\} damage and apoptosis. It was recently described as a component of a mitochondrial pathway selectively up-regulated in tumor cells which antagonizes the proapoptotic activity of cyclophilin D, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore regulator, and is responsible for the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, thus favoring cell survival. Interestingly, novel \{TRAP1\} antagonists cause sudden collapse of mitochondrial function and selective tumor cell death, suggesting that this pathway may represent a novel molecular target to improve anticancer therapy. Preliminary data suggest that \{TRAP1\} may be a valuable biomarker in ovarian cancers: in fact, \{TRAP1\} levels are significantly higher in cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumors and ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Conclusions While major advances have been made in understanding the genetics and molecular biology of cancer, given the considerable heterogeneity of ovarian cancer, the introduction of novel targeted therapies and the consequent selection of treatments based on the molecular profile of each tumor may have a major impact on the management of this malignancy and might contribute to building a new era of personalized medicine.}}

The distributions of all these variables show power-law behavior. On the other hand, agent-based models have been proposed to study the properties of real financial markets. We here study the statistical properties of these agent-based models and compare them with the results from our web-based market experiments.

We found that although being the most naive agent-based model, \{ZI\} indeed best describes the properties observed in real markets.

Anaerobic electron transfer reactions between laccase and carbon and gold electrodes were detected, both in solution and when the enzyme was adsorbed on these surfaces. In solution, a single high-potential signal (660 mV vs. SCE) was recorded at the carbon surfaces, attributable to the \{T1\} copper site of the enzyme. However, a well-defined oxidative process at about 660 mV and an anodic wave at 350 mV vs. \{SCE\} were recorded at the gold electrode, respectively associated with the \{T1\} and \{T2\} copper sites. Laccase-modified carbon electrodes behaved analogously when the enzyme was in solution, unlike laccase adsorbed on gold, which showed only a low-potential signal. Laccase molecules were successfully imaged by AFM; obtaining a thick compact stable film on Au(111), and large aggregates forming a complex network of small branches leaving voids on the \{HOPG\} surface. Laccase-modified carbon electrodes retained significant enzymatic activity, efficiently oxidising violuric acid and reducing molecular oxygen. Explanations are proposed for how protein-film organisation affects the electrode function.}}

Then, we introduce two switching communication protocols, one based on a switching coupling law between neighboring nodes, the other on the conditional activation of links in the network. We show that the former protocol induces the monotonicity of each system in the network, enhancing the speed of convergence to consensus. Moreover, adopting this novel protocol, we are able to control the network, steering the nodesâ€™ dynamics to a desired consensus value. The aim of the latter protocol is instead to select adaptively the activation of the edges of the network, in accordance with the dynamics of the network. After showing the effectiveness of both approaches through numerical simulations, the stability properties of these protocols are discussed.}}

However, an increasing number of reports have focused on neurodegenerative aspects of the disease pathogenesis. Recent studies in post-mortem \{MS\} biopsies and in the animal model Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) have shown that key features of neurodegeneration, i.e. axonal transection, neuronal cell atrophy and neuronal death already occur in early disease phases. Furthermore, it has become clear that irreversible disability correlates stronger with the neuronal affectation than with demyelination. However the cause of neuronal damage still remains elusive, since both demyelination-dependent and direct immune cell-mediated mechanisms have been suggested so far. Here, we summarize the current concepts and recently identified molecular mechanisms of inflammatory neurodegeneration in autoimmune \{CNS\} inflammation and highlight the role of different immune cells in the complex network of interactions leading to neuronal damage.}}

The formation of blade, smooth margins or serrations on the blade, or distinct leaflets that are the characteristic features of some leaves provides an opportunity to study the generation of morphogenesis in organs that are evolutionarily homologous and yet developmentally distinct in patterning. Intense research in several model species with distinct leaf morphologies has revealed a complex network of genes that interact to pattern the leaf. Several parallels between leaf patterning and shoot patterning exist. The plant growth hormone auxin is emerging as a key player in the specification of both shoot and leaf patterning. The outcome of this underlying auxin pattern may be determined by variation in the two opposing developmental forces of differentiation and indeterminancy. The expanded suite of genetic and physiological factors regulating leaf shape has provided interesting insight into the mechanisms by which morphological innovation is accomplished.}}

Such performance analysis calls for appropriate modeling and simulation tools.

In this paper, we demonstrate how an agent-based model can be developed to explicitly capture the interactions among the various constituents including the plants, functional departments, and external entities. As an illustrative case, an agent-based model of a lube additive manufacturing supply chain is introduced and the performance of the system studied under a significant range of behaviors, business policies, and environmental events.}}

Sampling bias is a critical problem in the field of complex networks ranging from biological networks, social networks and artificial networks like the Internet. This bias phenomenon depends on both the sampling method of the measurements and the features of the underlying networks. In \{RIPE\} \{NCC\} and the PlanetLab measurement architectures, the Internet is mapped as G âˆª m spt , the union of shortest paths between each pair of a set M of m testboxes, or equivalently, m shortest path trees. In this paper, we investigate this sampling method on a wide class of real-world complex networks as well as on the weighted ErdÃ¶sâ€“RÃ©nyi random graphs. This general framework examines the effect of the set of testboxes on G âˆª m spt . We establish the correlation between the subgraph G M of the underlying network, i.e. the set M and the direct links between nodes of set M , and the sampled network G âˆª m spt . Furthermore, we illustrate that in order to obtain an increasingly accurate view of a given network, a higher than linear detection/measuring effort (the relative size m / N of set M ) is needed, where N is the size of the underlying network. Finally, when the relative size m / N of set M is small, we characterize the kind of networks possessing small sampling bias, which provides insights on how to place the testboxes for good network topology measurement.}}

To examine the numerical results, we have developed a statistical method which relates the power-law exponent Î³ to random properties of the subgraph developed in the platform stage. As a result, we find that an important exponent in the network evolution is Î± , which characterizes the size of the subgraph in the form V âˆ¼ t Î± , where V and t denote the number of vertices in the subgraph and the time variable, respectively. 2D lattices can impose specific limitations on the walkerâ€™s diffusion, which keeps the value of Î± within a moderate range and provides typical properties of complex networks. 1D and 3D cases correspond to different ends of the spectrum for Î± , with 2D cases in between. Especially for 2D square lattices, a discontinuous change of the network structure is observed, which varies according to whether Î³ is greater or less than 2 . For 1D cases, we show that emergence of nearly complete subgraphs is guaranteed by Î± &lt; 1 / 2 , although the transient power-law is permitted at low increase rates of edges. Additionally, the model exhibits a spontaneous emergence of highly clustered structures regardless of its initial structure.}}

Synthetic genetic networks producing bistability and oscillations have been designed and constructed experimentally. However, in real biological systems, regulatory circuits are usually interconnected and the dynamics of those complex networks is often richer than the dynamics of simple modules. Here we couple the genetic Toggle switch and the Repressilator, two prototypic systems exhibiting bistability and oscillations, respectively. We study two types of coupling. In the first type, the bistable switch is under the control of the oscillator. Numerical simulation of this system allows us to determine the conditions under which a periodic switch between the two stable steady states of the Toggle switch occurs. In addition we show how birhythmicity characterized by the coexistence of two stable small-amplitude limit cycles, can easily be obtained in the system. In the second type of coupling, the oscillator is placed under the control of the Toggle switch. Numerical simulation of this system shows that this construction could for example be exploited to generate a permanent transition from a stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations (and vice versa) after a transient external perturbation. Those results thus describe qualitative dynamical behaviors that can be generated through the coupling of two simple network modules. These results differ from the dynamical properties resulting from interlocked feedback loops systems in which a given variable is involved at the same time in both positive and negative feedbacks. Finally the models described here may be of interest in synthetic biology, as they give hints on how the coupling should be designed to get the required properties.}}

Then we analyzed the distribution of the nodes in each shell, the distribution of the edges within the shell and to the higher shells and induced the computing functions. We proposed a new framework for modeling the Internet Router-level topology with the conclusion we have drawn and we implemented the model, \{HIR\} model. \{HIR\} model was based on the k-core decomposition in order to reveal the hierarchical of the network. The analysis shows that \{HIR\} model can reproduce Internet on most properties and has got the hierarchies of network close to that of Internet. The experiments show that \{HIR\} model can fully reflect the hierarchy characteristics of the Internet Router-level topology while preserving the power-law distribution on degree.}}

Better synchronizability means faster synchronization of the oscillators, sparsity means a low ratio of links per nodes and robustness refers to the resilience of a network to the random failures or intentional removal of some of the nodes/links. Golden spectral dynamical networks (graphs) are those for which the spectral spread (the difference between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix) is equal to the spectral gap (the difference between the two largest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix) multiplied by the square of the golden ratio. These networks display the property of â€œsmall-worldnessâ€�, are very homogeneous and have large isoperimetric (expansion) constant, together with a very high synchronizability and robustness to failures of individual oscillators. In particular, the regular bipartite dynamical networks, reported here by the first time, have the best possible expansion and consequently are the most robust ones against node/link failures or intentional attacks.}}

It was found that a small concentration of Laponite \{RD\} could lead to a significant increase in the storage modulus, loss modulus or complex viscosity. Compared with neat \{DAP\} hydrogel, the hybrid hydrogel has a greater hydrogel strength and a lower relaxation exponent. In particular, the enhancement of the clay nanoparticles to the viscoelastic properties of the \{DAP\} hydrogel is more effective in the case of higher \{DAP\} concentration. By relating its macroscopic elastic properties to a scaling fractal model, such a hybrid hydrogel was confirmed to be in the strong-link regime and to have a more complex network structure with a higher fractal dimension when compared with neat \{DAP\} hydrogel.}}

An approximation of the complete set of all best solutions, known as the Pareto optimal or non-inferior set, is derived by a special version of a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The applied \{MOGA\} proves to be suitable for the stochastic trade-off problem. A comprehensive set of computational results attest to the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed methodology. We were able to show from a medium-sized mixed network that the squared coefficient of service time variation plays an important role in buffer allocation, which indicates the importance of using a general service model. Moreover, after the analysis of the solutions in the decision variable space, we confirm that the buffer allocation is highly dependent on the target throughput, which sometimes can be sacrificed in favor of using fewer of the usually expensive buffer spaces.}}

Design Philosophical analysis of causality as it pertains to understanding the pathogenesis of pediatric strabismus and nystagmus. Methods Review of general philosophical problems and profession-related differences in assigning causality as they apply to current controversies in pediatric ophthalmology. Results Medicine is evolving into a systems era based on a complex network of interacting components including internal systems, gene expression, behavioral factors, and environmental factors. In this context, any definition of cause (epidemiologic, mechanical, physiologic, environmental, genetic, epigenetic, etc.) becomes a function of one's reference point. Thus, as medical science becomes more precise, causality seems to recede. Most current controversies in pediatric ophthalmology are reducible to simple questions of cause and effect. Strabismus and nystagmus often develop without apparent cause, providing a formidable challenge to deciphering disease pathogenesis and assigning causality. In these conditions, assigning causation is impeded by a tendency to confuse links and correlations with cause and effect, an inherent tendency to conflate form and function, the use of terminology that transposes cause and effect, and by our tendency to think linearly about problems that are fundamentally circular. Conclusions Our tendency to think linearly creates a self-referential system that influences our understanding of cause and effect. Neural activity is characterized by feedback loops and bidirectionality. Understanding neurodevelopmental strabismus and nystagmus requires a dynamic, circular view of causality.}}

A key question arising from these networks is the determination of the highly connected modules (communities). Communities can be defined using genetic similarity or distance statistics between multiple samples but due to limited specimen sampling capacity the boundaries of the communities for the known coral reefs in the seascape remain unresolved. In this study we use the microsatellite composition of individual corals to compare sample populations using a genetic dissimilarity measure (FST) which is then used to create a complex network. This network involved sampling 1025 colonies from 22 collection sites and examining 10 microsatellites loci. The links between each sampling site were given a strength that was created from the pair wise \{FST\} values. The result is an undirected weighted network describing the genetic dissimilarity between each sampled population. From this network we then determined the community structure using a leading eigenvector algorithm within graph theory. However, given the relatively limited sampling conducted, the representation of the regional genetic structure was incomplete. To assist with defining the boundaries of the genetically based communities we also integrated the communities derived from a hydrodynamic and distance based networks. The hydrodynamic network, though more comprehensive, was of smaller spatial extent than our genetic sampling. A Bayesian Belief network was developed to integrate the overlapping communities. The results indicate the genetic population structure of the Great Barrier Reef and provide guidance on where future genetic sampling should take place to complete the genetic diversity mapping.}}

The October 8, 2005 Mw 7.6 Kashmir earthquake, \{NW\} Himalaya, surface rupture provides an opportunity to study a complex network of secondary fractures developed on the hanging wall of the fault scarp. The main fault scarp is clearly thrust-type, rupture length is ~ 75 Â± 5 km and the overall trend of the rupture is NWâ€“SE. We present the results of our detailed structural mapping of secondary faults and fractures at 1:100 scale, on the hanging wall of the southern end of the rupture in the vicinity of the Sar Pain. Secondary ruptures can be broadly classified as two main types, 1) normal faults and, (2) right-lateral strike-slip â€˜Riedelâ€™ fractures. The secondary normal faults are NWâ€“SE striking, with a maximum 3.3 meter vertical displacement and 2.5 meter horizontal displacement. Estimated total horizontal extension across the secondary normal faults is 3.1â€“3.5%. We propose that the bending-moment and coseismic stress relaxation can explain the formation of secondary normal faults on the hanging wall of the thrust fault. The strike-slip â€˜Riedelâ€™ fractures form distinct sets of tension (T) and shear fractures (Râ€², R, Y) with right-lateral displacement. Field observations revealed that the â€˜Riedelâ€™ fractures (T) cut the secondary normal faults. In addition, there is kinematic incompatibility and magnitude mismatch between the secondary normal faults and strike-slip â€˜Riedelâ€™ fractures. The cross-cutting relationship, geometric and magnitude incoherence implies a temporal evolution of slip from dip- to strike-slip during the mainshock faulting. The interpretation is consistent with the thrust fault plane solution with minor right-lateral strike-slip component.}}

To better understand regulation of Cu homeostasis in plants, we use adult plant of Arabidopsis thaliana to provide an integrated view of how Cu status affects the expression of genes involved in cellular Cu homoeostasis. In doing so, we use real-time RT-PCR to compare shoot and roots transcriptional responses to Cu. We measure changes in the abundance of transcripts encoding transporters, chaperones and P-type \{ATPases\} and correlated those changes with variation of Cu content in both tissues. Our results indicated that in both tissues transcript levels of COPT2, 4, and \{ZIP2\} transporters and \{CCH\} chaperone were significantly down-regulated comparing to controls plants in response to Cu excess. In contrast, Cu chaperones ATX1, CCS, COX17-1 including two putative mitochondrial chaperones (At3g08950; At1g02410) were up-regulated under similar conditions. Regarding P-type ATPases, a reduction of HMA1, PAA1, PAA2, and \{RAN1\} transcript levels in shoot after Cu exposure was observed, while \{HMA5\} transcripts increased exclusively in roots. In plants growing under Cu-deficient conditions, COPT2, ZIP2, HMA1, and PAA2, were significantly up-regulated in shoots. Thus, our results indicated a common transcriptional regulation pattern of transporters and chaperone components, in particular transcriptional changes of COPT2, ZIP2, and \{CCH\} showed an inverse relation with Cu content suggesting that these proteins are required to avoid excess and deficit of Cu.}}

However, more recent clinical and experimental observations also suggest that human milk not only provides passive protection, but also can directly modulate the immunological development of the recipient infant. The study of this remarkable defense system in human milk has been difficult because of its biochemical complexity, the small concentration of certain bioactive components, the compartmentalization of some of these agents, the dynamic quantitative and qualitative changes of milk during lactation, and the lack of specific reagents to quantify these agents. However, a host of bioactive substances, including hormones, growth factors, and immunological factors such as cytokines, have been identified in human milk. Cytokines are pluripotent polypeptides that act in autocrine/paracrine fashions by binding to specific cellular receptors. They operate in networks and orchestrate the development and functions of immune system. Several different cytokines and chemokines have been discovered in human milk in the past years, and the list is growing very rapidly. This article will review the current knowledge about the increasingly complex network of chemoattractants, activators, and anti-inflammatory cytokines present in human milk and their potential role in compensating for the developmental delay of the neonate immune system.}}

Alterations in cell shape profoundly influence signaling events and gene expression programs that impact a spectrum of biological responses including cell growth, migration and apoptosis. These same pathways also contribute to the progression of several important pathologic conditions (e.g., arteriosclerosis, vascular fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction). Indeed, hemodynamic forces in the vascular compartment are established modifiers of endothelial and smooth muscle cell cytoarchitecture and orchestrate complex genetic and biological responses in concert with contributions from the extracellular matrix (ECM), growth factors (e.g., EGF, and TGF-Î²) and cell adhesion receptors (e.g., integrins, and cadherins). The profibrotic matricellular proteins plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are prominent members of a subset of genes the expression of which is highly responsive to cell shape-altering stimuli (i.e., disruption of the actin-based and microtubule networks, shear strain and cyclic stretch). Since both PAI-1 and \{CTGF\} are major mediators of cardiovascular fibrotic disease, understanding cell structure-linked signaling cascades provides potential avenues for focused therapy. It is increasingly evident that growth factor receptors (EGFR) are activated by changes in cytoarchitecture and that the â€œrepressive stateâ€� of certain signaling proteins (e.g., SMAD, and Rho-GEFs) is maintained by sequestration on cell structural networks. Functional repression can be relieved by cytoskeletal perturbations (e.g., in response to treatment with network-specific drugs) resulting in activation of signaling cascades (e.g., Rho, and MAPK) with associated changes in gene reprogramming. Recent studies document a complex network of both similar and unique signaling control elements leading to the induction of PAI-1 and \{CTGF\} in response to modifications in cell shape. The purpose of this review is to highlight our current understanding of â€œcell deformationâ€�-responsive signaling cascades focusing on the potential value of targeting such pathways, and their model response genes (e.g., PAI-1, and CTGF), as a therapeutic option for the treatment of fibrotic diseases.}}

Linkage studies and positional cloning strategies have identified mutations in a growing number of genes which cause monogenic autosomal-dominant or autosomal-recessive forms of the disorder. While these Mendelian forms of \{PD\} are relatively rare, high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies have more recently provided evidence that low-penetrance variants in at least some of these genes also play a direct role in the aetiology of the common sporadic disease. In addition, rare variants in other genes, such as the Gaucherâ€™s disease-associated glucocerebrosidase A, have also been found to be important risk factors at least in subgroups of patients. Thus, an increasingly complex network of genes contributing in different ways to disease risk and progression is emerging. These findings provide the â€˜genetic entry pointsâ€™ to identify molecular targets and readouts necessary to design rational disease-modifying treatments.}}

Linear artificial sequences of various lengths were easily integrated into the bacterial genome at one time. Comparison of the cellular concentrations of proteins encoded by genes carried on plasmids or the genome indicated that genome recombination could minimize the copy number noise in the genetic circuit, allowing precise design and interpretation of the cellular network. The refined recombination procedure allowed efficient construction of a single copy of a complex genetic circuit in cells, and the resultant reduced fluctuation in copy number led to accurate phenotypic behaviour of the genome-integrated synthetic switch corresponding to the design principle. The availability of long-fragment insertions makes the reconstruction of complex networks easy on the genome, and provides a powerful tool for precise engineering in synthetic and systems biology.}}

If I is coercive, then given a large simulated mean position, under general conditions our results imply that the most likely asymptotic behavior, Ïˆ âˆ— , of the paths n âˆ’ 1 W âŒŠ t n âŒ‹ is to be zero apart from on an interval [ T 0 , T 1 ] âŠ‚ [ 0 , 1 ] and to satisfy the functional equation âˆ‡ I ( d d t Ïˆ âˆ— ( t ) ) = Î» âˆ— ( T 1 âˆ’ t ) whenever Ïˆ ( t ) â‰  0 . If I is non-coercive, a similar, but slightly more involved, result holds. These results prove, in broad generality, that Monte Carlo estimates of the steady-state mean position of a \{RRW\} have a high likelihood of over-estimation. This has serious implications for the performance evaluation of queueing systems by simulation techniques where steady state expected queue-length and waiting time are key performance metrics. The results show that naÃ¯ve estimates of these quantities from simulation are highly likely to be conservative.}}

abstract = {Exotic plants are major constituents of species pools in modern landscapes. Managing succession for restoration of degraded ecosystems thus requires an understanding of novel trajectories unfolding in mixed, native/exotic plant assemblages. We examined trends in native and exotic species abundance over 20 years of old-field succession on set-aside farmland in the Inland Pampa, Argentina. Changes in plant cover and species richness were annually monitored on adjacent permanent plots established in different years (1978â€“1989). Both native and exotic species occurred in early, mid and late successional stages, exhibiting similar life-form replacement patterns, from annual forbs, through annual to perennial grasses. Exotic plant richness declined with plot age. Yet, four exotic grasses remained dominant through succession (50â€“70% cover), with plots initiated in later years showing increased exotic cover. While native perennial grasses occurred from the onset of succession, increasing from 5 to 12 spp/plot, they only showed transient peaks below 30% cover. Cluster analysis of 113 plot-year samples identified alternative community states for early, mid and late successional stages, which were connected by a complex network of interweaving dynamic pathways. Depending on the plot, vegetation dynamics comprised directional temporal trajectories as well as nondirectional pathways, and arrested community states dominated by exotic grasses. Our results illustrate the overwhelming role of exotic species in modern old-field succession, and their potential to hinder recovery of native communities on former agricultural land. Community states with novel, native/exotic plant mixtures could be managed to deliver specific ecosystem services (e.g. forage production, carbon sequestration). However, meeting conservation goals may require active restoration measures, including exotic plant removals and native grass seeding.}}

In 1983 different plots from grass-shrub Patagonian steppes were submitted to three treatments: control, grass-, and shrub-removal during three consecutive years. In 1997 we studied nine plots from the original experiment and recorded all shrubs to compare shrub density, population size structure, vitality, spatial patterns and neighbourhood interferences of three native and co-dominant shrub species: Mulinum spinosum, Senecio filaginoides, and Adesmia volckmanni. After 12 years of recovery, shrubs as a growth-form group, fully re-established in plots where they were removed and attained 75% higher density in grass-removal plots than in control plots. However, long-term population responses of Mulinum, Senecio, and Adesmia to removals were distinctive. On the other hand, negative and positive interferences among shrub species and between shrubs and grasses generated a complex network. Morphological and functional differences in shrub and grass species and their interactions at population level and long-term could be a key to achieve a better comprehension of shrub-grass coexistence from semi-arid ecosystems.}}

The regulatory functions of the addressed \{GONs\} are described by the sector-like nonlinear functions.

Further, aggregating individualsâ€™ preferences into a group preference or merging individual recommendations into group recommendationsâ€”an essential component of group recommendationâ€”often results in dissatisfaction of a small number of group members while satisfying the majority. To support group activities in online communities, this paper proposes an improved group recommendation procedure that improves not only the group recommendation effectiveness but also the satisfaction of individual group members. It consists of two phases. The first phase was to generate a recommendation set for a group using the typical collaborative filtering method that most existing group recommendation systems utilize. The second phase was to remove irrelevant items from the recommendation set in order to improve satisfaction of individual membersâ€™ preferences. We built a prototype system and performed experiments. Our experiment results showed that the proposed system has consistently higher precision and individual members are more satisfied.}}

The large-scale clinical data are the core empirical knowledge source for \{TCM\} research. This paper introduces a clinical data warehouse (CDW) system, which incorporates the structured electronic medical record (SEMR) data for medical knowledge discovery and \{TCM\} clinical decision support (CDS). Materials and methods We have developed the clinical reference information model (RIM) and physical data model to manage the various information entities and their relationships in \{TCM\} clinical data. An extraction-transformation-loading (ETL) tool is implemented to integrate and normalize the clinical data from different operational data sources. The \{CDW\} includes online analytical processing (OLAP) and complex network analysis (CNA) components to explore the various clinical relationships. Furthermore, the data mining and \{CNA\} methods are used to discover the valuable clinical knowledge from the data. Results The \{CDW\} has integrated 20,000 \{TCM\} inpatient data and 20,000 outpatient data, which contains manifestations (e.g. symptoms, physical examinations and laboratory test results), diagnoses and prescriptions as the main information components. We propose a practical solution to accomplish the large-scale clinical data integration and preprocessing tasks. Meanwhile, we have developed over 400 \{OLAP\} reports to enable the multidimensional analysis of clinical data and the case-based CDS. We have successfully conducted several interesting data mining applications. Particularly, we use various classification methods, namely support vector machine, decision tree and Bayesian network, to discover the knowledge of syndrome differentiation. Furthermore, we have applied association rule and \{CNA\} to extract the useful acupuncture point and herb combination patterns from the clinical prescriptions. Conclusion A \{CDW\} system consisting of \{TCM\} clinical RIM, ETL, \{OLAP\} and data mining as the core components has been developed to facilitate the tasks of \{TCM\} knowledge discovery and CDS. We have conducted several \{OLAP\} and data mining tasks to explore the empirical knowledge from the \{TCM\} clinical data. The \{CDW\} platform would be a promising infrastructure to make full use of the \{TCM\} clinical data for scientific hypothesis generation, and promote the development of \{TCM\} from individualized empirical knowledge to large-scale evidence-based medicine.}}

When a video sharing server has insufficient uplink bandwidth and needs to serve multiple video content sharing services via streaming or downloading to other client peers using \{TCP\} transport, each service shares the limited uplink bandwidth equitably, due to the fair sharing characteristics inherent in TCP. However this bandwidth fair sharing cannot always guarantee quality fairness among the services, due to the specific requirements for video-streaming services, such as the playout rate and the size of the playout buffer. In our system, the server uses multiple \{TCP\} connections adaptively, depending on the anticipated status of each client playout buffer, to guarantee the bandwidth of each video-streaming session. By guaranteeing the quality of each video-streaming session, without the quality loss of other service sessions, the proposed system can successfully achieve service quality fairness. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can dramatically enhance the quality of each streaming session and thus provide service quality fairness among simultaneous multiple heterogeneous video-streaming services and content download services.}}

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most well known and the best examined of the \{PR\} receptors. In the last years \{TLRs\} had been studied in different ways resulting in a lot of new insights in the function and signalling pathways of these receptors. However, it was not possible to investigate individual combinations of the \{TLRs\} and their specific ligands, because of the complex network in immune signalling resulting in interference with each other. This work shows a new cell-based assay, established for the analysis of single \{PRRs\} or heterodimers. For this purpose \{NIH3T3\} (mouse fibroblasts) were stably transfected with the NF-ÎºB-inducible reporter gene secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) together with the corresponding combinations of human \{TLRs\} and their co-receptors (e.g. TLR1/2, TLR2/6 and TLR4/CD14). The specificity of the respective cell lines was shown by induction with variations of specific and unspecific ligands (immune-stimulating components of microorganisms or synthetic ligands). Analysis via the NF-ÎºB-dependent reporter gene \{SEAP\} allows a direct way to detect the human TLR-activity. Our results showed that this assay is highly sensitive and specific for the respective ligands. For the synthetic ligands Pam2CysSK4 the assay demonstrates a detection limit of 1 pg/ml for TLR2/6. In summary, this test system allows the investigation of individual human PRR-receptors in a highly specific way, without interference with other immune components opening new avenues for novel insights in the innate immune system and its applications.}}

Using a nonlinear complementary function, the complex discrete difference dynamic model is transformed into a set of familiar discrete difference algebraic equations. Then, the complex dynamic behaviors of power markets are quantitatively analyzed. Corresponding to different operating conditions of power network, such as congestion or non-congestion, the Nash equilibrium of power markets and its stability are calculated, and the periodic and even chaotic dynamic behaviors are exhibited when the market parameters are beyond the stability region of the Nash equilibrium.}}

We overcame these issues by casting the process of investigating behavioural interactions into a network inference methodology. We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis aries. We uncovered underlying patterns of behavioural interaction between individual sheep by applying our inferential approach to the symbolic multivariate time series of activity, that is grazing, not grazing. Our findings clearly indicate that animals of the same sex are more synchronized than animals of different sex independent of body size. We advocate that the method proposed is more general and more efficient at detecting patterns of synchronization than traditional concordance indices. We provide the reader with a comprehensive software toolbox to apply the methodology proposed.}}

The role of a variety of mitigation practices in stabilising the environment has been investigated over the last decade, as has the potential of active debris removal (ADR) methods in recent work. We present a theoretical approach to the analysis of the debris environment that is based on the study of networks, composed of vertices and edges, which describe the dynamic relationships between Earth satellites in the debris system. Future projections of the 10 cm and larger satellite population in a non-mitigation scenario, conducted with the \{DAMAGE\} model, are used to illustrate key aspects of this approach. Information from the \{DAMAGE\} projections are used to reconstruct a network in which vertices represent satellites and edges encapsulate conjunctions between collision pairs. The network structure is then quantified using statistical measures, providing a numerical baseline for this future projection scenario. Finally, the impact of mitigation strategies and active debris removal, which can be mapped onto the network by altering or removing edges and vertices, can be assessed in terms of the changes from this baseline. The paper introduces the network methodology, and highlights the ways in which this approach can be used to formalise criteria for debris mitigation and removal. It then summarises changes to the adopted network that correspond to an increasing stability and changes that represent a decreasing stability of the future debris environment.}}

We review in the context of the risk of emerging plant diseases recent developments including the movement towards a global horticultural market, the rise of the horticultural industry of many developing countries, and the economic integration of the European Union. North America is typically well ahead of other regions in economic developments, and in horticulture this is shown for example by the growing importance of Mexican growers. Asia is rapidly catching up also in horticulture, with China and India becoming key producers. Australia and New Zealand show the impact of change in horticulture extension services. The Eastern enlargement of the \{EU\} is having profound influences on fruit and vegetable growers both in the new and in the old member countries. Similar developments are taking place in South America and Africa. In all continents, there is a general trend towards fewer and larger horticultural growers, an increasing role of supermarkets and a concentration of the retail pathways. These developments have consequences for the control of plant pathogens and invasive species. Technical issues seem to be of lesser consequence in terms of structural change compared with labour and trade aspects. However, examples can be found where technical innovations have opened up new opportunities or provided solutions to pressing problems, as can be seen in the hardy nursery stock and ornamental industry in the UK. Future technical, economic and social impacts on the sector are likely to play a key role for securing a diverse and reliable food supply for the still expanding world's population. Recent advances in modelling disease spread in complex networks representing trade pathways should be used to target control of introductions of new plant pathogens. There is a need for more long-term research on how structural change in the horticultural sector will affect and be affected by climate change.}}

Effects of this spatial sampling in relation to structural network measures like centrality and assortativity were analyzed using multivariate classifiers. A simplified model of 3D brain connectivity incorporating both short- and long-range connections served for testing. To mimic M/EEG recordings we sampled this model via non-overlapping regions and weighted nodes and connections according to their proximity to the recording sites. We used various complex network models for reference and tried to classify sampled versions of the â€œbrain-likeâ€� network as one of these archetypes. It was found that sampled networks may substantially deviate in topology from the respective original networks for small sample sizes. For experimental studies this may imply that surface recordings can yield network structures that might not agree with its generating 3D network.}}

Modulation of expression, on both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, is the major regulation mechanism for iNOS. Pathways resulting in the induction of iNOS expression vary in different cells or species. Activation of the transcription factors NF-ÎºB and STAT-1Î± and thereby activation of the iNOS promoter seems to be an essential step for the iNOS induction in most human cells. However, at least in the human system, also post-transcriptional mechanisms involving a complex network of RNA-binding proteins build up by AUF1, HuR, KSRP, \{PTB\} and \{TTP\} is critically involved in the regulation of iNOS expression.

Here we report that Slug over-expression associated with Bcr-Abl is conditional upon the tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of 210 fusion protein. Slug over-expression is driven by transcriptional events eventually integrated by post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to protein stabilization and is at least partly regulated by the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). It contributes to apoptosis resistance of leukemic progenitors through the repression of pro-apoptotic Puma. Moreover, Slug is a component of leukemic progenitor resistance to imatinib mesylate (IM) driven by Bcr-Abl point mutations and, in particular, by T315I. Slug over-expression associated with p210 Bcr-Abl \{TK\} either in the wild type (wt) or mutated conformation results in a significant reduction of E-cadherin, the substrate of Beta catenin at cell membranes. In conclusion, our results suggest that Slug has a central role in a complex network involved in prolonged survival and \{IM\} resistance of \{CML\} progenitors.}}

Cross sample entropy and cross entropy approaches are also applied to examine the synchrony behavior among the Asian currencies. The study also shows that the Asian exchange rate markets featured are neither stochastic nor efficient.

One crucial property among response regulators functions is their oligomerization and subsequent binding to DNA. The AtoSâ€“AtoC two component system, functionally modulated by various agents, influences fundamental cellular processes such as short-chain fatty acid catabolism and poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Among the already reported characteristic properties, AtoC binds to a specific site, a palindromic repeat of 20 nucleotides within the atoDAEB promoter. Since experimental structures of AtoC or its complex with \{DNA\} are not yet available, an almost complete homology model of AtoC and of its putative entity as a dimer is constructed for this study, as well as a model of its binding to its target \{DNA\} sequence. The latter is associated with large conformational changes, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequent biochemical study, including cross-linking via chemical agents, revealed the ability of AtoC to form oligomers in vitro.}}

Global balance laws for mass, momentum (and energy) are formulated for the volumes. An implementation of the approach requires closing unknown REW-scale mass fluxes and forces exchanged across the REW-internal control volume boundaries and between REWs. In the present paper we focus exclusively on the horizontal groundwater flow, while neglecting other hydrological processes such as surface runoff, subsurface stormflow and surface-groundwater interaction. Here we describe a simplified groundwater modeling approach, which is based on the parsimonious estimation of mass fluxes exchanged laterally between REWs. The procedure employs principles of mass and energy conservation as stated by the Kirchhoff laws. The problem is reduced to the solution of a coupled system of linear equations in terms of inter-REW groundwater fluxes and a dimensionless ratio Î˜ between the local saturated zone depths ys and spatial length scales Î› over which piezometric head gaps are dissipated. The equation system is solved by successive approximation, as suggested by the Cross method, which is used in engineering practice for resolving resistor networks under steady state conditions. The procedure converges rapidly for complex network configurations. It is shown that for given boundary fluxes imposed at the watershed edges, mass fluxes exchanged in-between \{REWs\} can be calculated in an unique and consistent fashion. The paper briefly reviews the essential governing equations, introduces the formulation of the problem in terms of the Kirchoff laws and shows the numerical solution of the network. Simulation results for an application to the Hesbaye groundwater system in Belgium are presented.}}

Both functions are facilitated by secretions lining airway surface liquid, mucus (in the upper airways) and pulmonary surfactant (in the alveoli). Mucins, the main glycoproteins present within the mucus, are responsible for its rheologic properties and participate in lung defense mechanisms. In parallel, lung collectins are pattern recognition molecules present in pulmonary surfactant that also modulate lung defense. During chronic airways diseases, excessive protease activity can promote mucus hypersecretion and degradation of lung collectins and therefore contribute to the pathophysiology of these diseases. Importantly, secretion of local and systemic anti-proteases might be crucial to equilibrate the protease/anti-protease unbalance and therefore preserve the function of lung host defense compounds and airway surface liquid homeostasis. In this review we will present information relative to proteases able to modulate mucin production and lung collectin integrity, two important compounds of innate immune defense. One strategy to preserve physiological mucus production and collectin integrity during chronic airways diseases might be the over-expression of local â€˜alarmâ€™ anti-proteases such as \{SLPI\} and elafin. Interestingly, a cross-talk between lung collectins and anti-protease activity has recently been described, implicating the presence within the lung of a complex network between proteases, anti-proteases and pattern recognition molecules, which aims to keep or restore homeostasis in resting or inflamed lungs.}}

Skipping of the \{CD45\} variable exons is controlled, in large part, by the recruitment of \{PSF\} to the pre-mRNA substrate upon TÂ cell activation; however, the signaling cascade leading to exon exclusion has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that in resting TÂ cells \{PSF\} is directly phosphorylated by GSK3, thus promoting interaction of \{PSF\} with TRAP150, which prevents \{PSF\} from binding \{CD45\} pre-mRNA. Upon TÂ cell activation, reduced \{GSK3\} activity leads to reduced \{PSF\} phosphorylation, releasing \{PSF\} from \{TRAP150\} and allowing it to bind \{CD45\} splicing regulatory elements and repress exon inclusion. Our data place two players, \{GSK3\} and TRAP150, in the complex network that regulates \{CD45\} alternative splicing and demonstrate a paradigm for signal transduction from the cell surface to the \{RNA\} processing machinery through the multifunctional protein PSF.}}

Here, we further explored the role of \{UDCA\} in downregulating p53 by Mdm-2. \{UDCA\} reduced the stability of p53 by decreasing protein half-life. Although proteasomal activity was slightly increased with UDCA, the effect was also observed for other bile acids. More importantly, immunoprecipitation assays revealed that \{UDCA\} promoted p53 ubiquitination, therefore leading to increased p53 degradation. In this regard, proteasome inhibition after \{UDCA\} pre-treatment resulted in accumulation of ubiquitinated p53, which in turn was prevented in cells overexpressing a mutated form of p53 that does not undergo Mdm-2 ubiquitination. The involvement of Mdm-2 in UDCA-mediated response was further confirmed by siRNA-mediated gene silencing experiments. Finally, the protective effect of \{UDCA\} against p53-induced apoptosis was abolished after inhibition of proteasome activity and prevention of p53 ubiquitination by Mdm-2. These findings suggest that \{UDCA\} protects cells from p53-mediated apoptosis by promoting its degradation via the Mdm-2-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.}}

The spatial expression of segment polarity genes results from a complex network of interacting proteins whose expression products are maintained after successful segmentation. This prompted us to investigate the stability and robustness of this process using a dynamical model for the segmentation network based on Boolean states. The model consists of intra-cellular as well as inter-cellular interactions between adjacent cells in one spatial dimension. We quantify the robustness of the dynamical segmentation process by a systematic analysis of mutations. Our starting point consists in a previous Boolean model for Drosophila segmentation. We define mathematically the notion of dynamical robustness and show that the proposed model exhibits limited robustness in gene expression under perturbations. We applied in silico evolution (mutation and selection) and discover two classes of modified gene networks that have a more robust spatial expression pattern. We verified that the enhanced robustness of the two new models is maintained in differential equations models. By comparing the predicted model with experiments on mutated flies, we then discuss the two types of enhanced models. Drosophila patterning can be explained by modelling the underlying network of interacting genes. Here we demonstrate that simple dynamical considerations and in silico evolution can enhance the model to robustly express the expected pattern, helping to elucidate the role of further interactions.}}

The stem cell factor (SCF) receptor \{KIT\} (CD117) is expressed on all types of \{MC\} independent of maturation and activation-status. In systemic mastocytosis (SM), \{KIT\} is often expressed in \{MC\} in a mutated and constitutively activated form. In these patients, \{MC\} aberrantly display \{CD2\} and CD25, diagnostic markers of neoplastic \{MC\} in all \{SM\} variants. In advanced SM, \{MC\} co-express substantial amounts of CD30, whereas \{CD2\} expression on \{MC\} may be decreased compared to indolent SM. Other surface molecules, such as \{CD63\} or CD203c, are overexpressed on neoplastic \{MC\} in SM, and are further upregulated upon cross-linking of the IgE receptor. Some of the cell surface antigens expressed on \{MC\} or their progenitors may serve as therapeutic targets in the future. These targets include CD25, CD30, CD33, CD44, and CD117/KIT. The current article provides an overview on cell surface antigens and target receptors expressed by \{MC\} in physiologic and reactive tissues, and in patients with SM, with special reference to phenotypic heterogeneity and clinical implications.}}

In existing implementations, however, one fundamental aspect is neglected: security. Byzantine nodes may subvert the peer sampling service and bias the random selection process, for example, by increasing the probability that a fellow malicious node is selected instead of a random one. The contribution of this paper is an extension to existing peer sampling protocols with a detection mechanism that identifies and blacklists nodes that are suspected of behaving maliciously. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that our extension is efficient in dealing with a large number of malicious nodes.}}

Whereas the reaction with hydrogen of C-2-OL in ethanol solutions yields hydrogenated products through a complex network, and no reaction takes place in the absence of hydrogen, in the present case C-2-OL is converted first to 2,5-dihydrofuran (2,5-DHF) and water. This step occurs on the silica support at room temperature, probably through the intermediacy of the surface species â€“Siâ€“Oâ€“CH2â€“CHCHâ€“CH2â€“OH. The presence of Pd nanoparticles allows, at ca. 100 Â°C, the subsequent isomerization of 2,5-DHF to 2,3-dihydrofuran (2,3-DHF). The same reaction requires a higher temperature (ca. 150 Â°C) with the Pt catalyst. At higher temperatures, the expected dehydrogenation of both 2,5- and 2,3-DHFs to furan takes place. On the support alone at 350 Â°C 2,5-DHF is converted to furan, and 2,3-DHF to carbonyl-containing species (as suggested in the literature), through thermal reactions.}}

Spectroscopic observations were used to identify extensive hydrated silicate deposits, including prehnite, chlorites, smectites, and opaline material, a suite of phases that frequently results from hydrothermal alteration in terrestrial craters and also expected on Mars from geochemical modeling of hydrothermal environments. When combined with altimetry and high-resolution imaging data, these deposits appear associated predominantly with the central uplift and with portions of the northern part of the crater floor. Detailed geologic mapping of these deposits reveals geomorphic features that are consistent with hydrothermal activity that followed the impact event, including vent-like and conical mound structures, and a complex network of tectonic structures caused by fluid interactions such as fractures and joints. The crater age has been calculated from the cumulative crater sizeâ€“frequency distributions and is found to be Early Hesperian. The evidence presented here provides support for impact-induced hydrothermal activity in Toro crater, that extends phyllosilicate formation processes beyond the Noachian era.}}

For quite some time now, we have proposed the study of endogenous anti-inflammation as a distinctive approach to the discovery of new drugs. This approach requires development of new compounds that activate specific receptor targets to downregulate the cellular and tissue pathways operative in the host during inflammation. Here we dwell on a family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) termed FPRs, acronym for formyl-peptide receptors. With three and seven members in man and mouse, respectively, these receptors harness many biological functions, spanning odour perception and hair growth, to the control of multiple facets (pain; cell migration; oxidative burst; xenobiotic engulfment) of the inflammatory reaction. We focus on \{FPR\} biology with particular attention to molecules able to produce pharmacological effects by interacting with these GPCRs, describing endogenous agonists of \{FPRs\} and, more relevantly, the current development of synthetic agonists. Besides being potential leads for the development of the anti-inflammatory therapeutics of the future, these compounds could also help clarify the properties and roles that each \{FPR\} might play in the complex network of pathways that is inflammation. We conclude that \{FPR2\} agonists could be valid warhorses for defining a novel philosophy for anti-inflammatory drug discovery programmes: mimicking â€“ with new compounds â€“ the way our body disposes of inflammation could be a viable approach to regulate aberrant inflammatory responses as in the case of several chronic rheumatic and cardiovascular pathologies.}}

abstract = {Hydroxyapatite (HA)/polysaccharide composites have been widely used in bone tissue engineering due to their chemical similarity to natural bone. Polymer matrix-mediated synthesis of nano-hydroxyapatite is one of the simplest models for biomimetic. In this article, the nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosanâ€“pectin (nHCP) composites were prepared through in situ mineralization of hydroxyapatite in chitosanâ€“pectin polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) network. The formation processes of nHCP were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The interactions between nHA crystal and chitosanâ€“pectin \{PEC\} networks were studied using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The morphology and structure of nHA crystal were characterized by \{XRD\} and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Results suggested that the interfacial interactions between nano-hydroxyapatite crystal and chitosanâ€“pectin \{PEC\} network assist the site specific nucleation and growth of nHA nanoparticles. The nHA crystals grow along the c-axis. In this process, pH value is the main factor to control the nucleation and growth of nHA crystal in chitosanâ€“pectin \{PEC\} networks, because both the interactions' strength between nHA crystal and chitosanâ€“pectin and diffusion rate of inorganic ions depend on the pH value of the reaction system. Apart from the pH value, the chitosan/pectin ratio and [Ca2+] also take important effects on the formation of nHA crystal. An effective way to control the size of nHA crystal is to adjust the content of pectin and [Ca2+]. It is interesting that the Zeta potential of nHCP composites is about âˆ’ 30 mV when the chitosan/pectin ratio â‰¦ 1:1, and the dispersion solution of nHCP composites has higher stability, which provides the possibility to prepare 3D porous scaffolds with nHCP for bone tissue engineering.}}

An important characteristic of asthma is the bronchial inflammation with a complex network of cells and inflammatory mediators of pivotal importance in the pathogenesis. The long term control and treatment of this disease are cardinal points of the management of asthmatic syndrome. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the first-line treatment for persistent asthma in children of any age. The adverse events of the inhaled steroids on growth, bone mineralization, and hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function are the main concerns for the pediatricians. The long-term effects on growth and bone mineralization are actually reassuring. Good tolerance is achieved on hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis function with low to moderate doses in children. Scientific and clinical researches are pointed to find out molecules able to improve clinical efficacy of \{ICS\} with better tolerance and higher reduction of adverse events.}}

Recent studies have provided important insights into the mechanism of 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated differentiation. For myeloid progenitors to complete monocytic differentiation a complex network of intracellular signals has to be activated and/or inactivated in a precise temporal and spatial pattern. 1,25(OH)2D3 achieves this change to the â€˜signaling landscapeâ€™ by (i) direct genomic modulation of the level of expression of key regulators of cell signaling and differentiation pathways, and (ii) activation of intracellular signaling pathways. An improved understanding of the mode of action of 1,25(OH)2D3 is facilitating the development of new therapeutic regimens.}}

However, chemokines are redundant. Consequently, the protective effect of MCP-1 deficiency may be mediated by changes in other cytokine signals. Methods and results: Changes in the pattern of gene expression in the aorta were evaluated in LDLrâˆ’/âˆ’ and MCP-1âˆ’/âˆ’ LDLrâˆ’/âˆ’ mice fed either chow or Western-style diet. Functional analyses were used to characterize the pathways affected and to identify biological processes in which MCP-1 may play an additional role. Some data also suggest that MCP-5 may act as a surrogate for MCP-1 deletion. Arteriosclerosis lesion and plaque composition are associated with enrichment in the cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interaction pathway. Conclusions: There is a complex network of interactions linking MCP-1 and other cytokines. The lack of MCP-1 limits the aortic response to atherogenic stimuli, but does not completely protect against neointima formation. Activation of alternative inflammatory pathways in the vascular wall in response to MCP-1 deficiency should be considered to fully understand the actual role of this chemokine.}}

All these functional activities are regulated and conducted through a combination of instructions that make up the so-called genetic code.

abstract = {Background Rejection of transplanted liver occurs when the host generates alloantigen-reactive T cells, and CD4+ T-cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, \{T17\} and iTreg, could be involved in changing the dynamics of graft rejection onset. In the current immunosuppressive strategies, rejection is treated as an undifferentiated process that is uniform, which results in the failure of tolerance induction. Here, we established a rejection model to observe the reciprocal interaction of CD4+ T-cell subsets in the complex networks of the immune system. Methods Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) from male inbred Lewis rats (n = 15) to male inbred Brown Norway (BN) rats was performed by Kamada's two-cuff technique without reconstruction of the hepatic artery. \{OLT\} from \{BN\} to \{BN\} rats (n = 5) was performed as a control. Recipients were sacrificed on postoperative days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15. Recipient spleens and grafts were harvested, fixed in 10% neutral formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Meanwhile, hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining was done, acute rejection was graded by the Banff scheme, and the number of T-bet+, GATA-3+, RORÎ³t+ and FOXP3+ cells in the spleen and grafts were counted. Results In recipient spleens, the T-bet+ and RORÎ³t+ cells were increased more significantly in the mild acute rejection (AR) group than in the control group (P = 0.016, P = 0.009, respectively), while both cell types were decreased in the moderate \{AR\} group. Compared with the control group, the RORÎ³t+ cells did not differ significantly in the severe \{AR\} group, while the T-bet+ cells were significantly decreased (P = 0.465, P = 0.009, respectively). The GATA-3+ cells were significantly decreased in the mild \{AR\} group compared with the control group (P = 0.009). With regard to the FOXP3+ cells, there was no significant difference between the control and mild \{AR\} groups (P = 0.754), while they were significantly decreased in the moderate and severe \{AR\} groups (P = 0.028, P = 0.009, respectively). The ratio of T-bet+/GATA-3+ cells was more associated with \{AR\} than was the RORÎ³t+/FOXP3+ cell ratio in the early stage. In the graft, the T-bet+ and RORÎ³t+ cells were significantly increased in mild, moderate and severe \{AR\} groups compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.009). The expression of GATA-3+ cell was not significantly increased in the mild \{AR\} group compared with the control group, while it was significantly increased in the moderate and severe \{AR\} groups (P = 0.028, P = 0.009, respectively). Concerning the FOXP3+ cells, no significant difference was found between the control and mild \{AR\} groups (P = 0.347), while they were significantly increased in the moderate and severe \{AR\} groups (P &lt; 0.009). Conclusions Our study revealed the dynamic changes of T-bet+, GATA-3+, RORÎ³t+ and FOXP3+ cells in the spleen and grafts of recipient rats. It seems that the ratio of T-bet+/GATA-3+ cells was more associated with \{AR\} than was RORÎ³t+/FOXP3+ cells in the early stage of rejection, while the ratio of RORÎ³t+/FOXP3+ cells was associated more with the later but more persistent stage of rejection. This study could make a contribution to the optimal selection of immunosuppressive regimens according to the dynamic changes in CD4+ T-cell subsets at different stages of rejection.}}

It is found that the thermal conductivity (Îº) of SiNWs diverges with the length as, Îº âˆ� LÎ², even when the length is up to 1.1 Î¼m which is much longer than the phonon mean free path. The dependences of Î² on temperature and length are also discussed. Moreover, an anomalous heat diffusion is observed which is believed to be responsible for the length dependent thermal conductivity. Our results provide strong evidence that Fourier's law of heat conduction is not valid in low-dimensional nanostructures.}}

The intrinsic complexity embedded on the chaotic dynamics with its hallmark property of sensitive dependence on initial conditions provides a masterful framework that can be exploited to develop remarkably fast, efficient and robust communication systems at low cost. As so, they can be used to support intensive communication among process distributed over a network, which is the scenario that may exist when the concept of satellite formation flying is used. In this configuration, the set of satellites operates as a â€œmassive virtualâ€� satellite with a very large capability that would require a huge, complex and expensive monolithic satellite. In this work, we analyze a key issue to accomplish a chaotic based communication systemâ€”the synchronization among the communication agents. To allow communication, all of the agents must have their chaotic dynamics synchronized with each other. However, in a scenario involving a satellite formation flying, it is necessary to deal with substantial signal delays on the communication among the satellites. These delays impose severe restrictions or even do not allow the accomplishment of the synchronization process if common strategies are used. Here, we propose an approach that allows to properly obtain synchronization among the communication agents on the satellites of the formation, despite the communication delays. It is based on the optimal linear feedback control theory and takes in consideration the â€œmean fieldâ€� of the population of chaotic oscillators.}}

Ridge belts and graben and groove belts can be observed at the studied area, while wrinkle ridges and large individual grooves predominate in the smooth plains. Transcurrent components of displacement are commonly observed, and transpression and transtension zones are the rule rather than the exception at most of the studied belts. Along-strike azimuth changes of deformation belts are accommodated by internal variations in the predominance of contractional, transcurrent or extensional structures. The material of the surrounding plains embays most of these deformation belts. The kinematic analysis of this complex network of tectonic structures suggests a broadly synchronous activity of contractional, transcurrent and extensional structures. The maximum horizontal shortening axis determined in this work describes a steady, semi-circular pattern centered at Alpha Regio. This deformation continued, although with subdued activity, after embayment of the deformation belts by the material of the plains. Future study of the tectonic evolution of the lowland plains should take into account the importance of the coeval history of neighboring uplands and lowlands.}}

During embryonic \{CNS\} development of Drosophila, the Hox protein Abdominal-A (AbdA) is required for the specification of the abdominal NB6-4 lineage. It does so by down regulating the expression of the cell cycle regulator gene Dcyclin E (CycE). CycE is normally expressed in the thoracic NB6-4 lineage to give rise to mixed lineage of neurons and glia, while only glial cells are produced from the abdominal NB6-4 lineage due to the repression of CycE by AbdA. Here we investigate how AbdA represses the expression of CycE to define the abdominal fate of a single NB6-4 precursor cell. We analyze, both in vitro and in vivo, the regulation of a 1.9 kb CNS-specific CycE enhancer element in the abdominal NB6-4 lineage. We show that CycE is a direct target of AbdA and it binds to the \{CNS\} specific enhancer of CycE to specifically repress the enhancer activity in vivo. Our results suggest preferential involvement of a series of multiple AbdA binding sites to selectively enhance the repression of CycE transcription. Furthermore, our data suggest a complex network to regulate CycE expression where AbdA functions as a key regulator.}}

In this work, a dynamic depression control method imposed on the internal state of neurons for chaotic neural networks is proposed. In this way, the decay parameters and the scaling parameter for the refractoriness are time varying determined by the internal state of neurons. Ascribing to dynamic depression control, chaos is controlled in a self-adaptive manner and no target needs to be specified in advance. Furthermore, the theoretic analysis of dynamic depression control is presented. The numerical simulation proves that the chaos in the chaotic neural network can be controlled with the dynamic depression control, and the neural network can be stabilized to a stored pattern if the control strength parameter is chosen suitable.}}

The endpoints of these shortcuts are nodes with more powerful hardware, leading to a heterogeneous sensor network. We evaluate the on-line models and show that they present the same small world features observed in the theoretical models. When the shortcuts are created toward the sink node, with a small number of powerful sensors, the network presents better small world features and interesting tradeoffs between energy and latency in the data communication when compared with the Random Additional Model.

abstract = {In this paper, we study the effect of time delay on spiking synchronizations in Newmanâ€“Watts networks of stochastic Hodgkinâ€“Huxley (HH) neurons. It is found that as Ï„ is increased, the neurons exhibit transitions from spiking synchronization (SS) to clustering anti-phase synchronization (APS) and back to SS. Furthermore, the \{SS\} after the \{APS\} is enhanced with increasing time delay. For different patch sizes (channel noise strength), network randomness (fraction of random connections), and coupling strengths, the neurons exhibit similar synchronization transitions and the \{APS\} always occurs at around Ï„=4, representing that the time delay-induced \{APS\} behavior is robust to the channel noise, the number of random connections, and the coupling strength. A simple explanation for this phenomenon was given in terms of the relation of spiking time-period and time delay values. Since the information processing in the neurons are fulfilled by the spiking activity of the membrane potential and the spiking synchronization plays a crucial role in the spiking activity, our results may help us understand the effect of time delay as well as the interplay of channel noise and time delay on the spiking activity and hence the information processing in stochastic neuronal systems.}}

We analyze the global statistical properties of the transcriptional regulatory network of the prokaryote Escherichia coli, identifying each operon with a node of the network. We propose a null model for this network using the content-based approach applied earlier to the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Balcan et al., 2007). Random sequences that represent promoter regions and binding sequences are associated with the nodes. The length distributions of these sequences are extracted from the relevant databases. The network is constructed by testing for the occurrence of binding sequences within the promoter regions. The ensemble of emergent networks yields an exponentially decaying in-degree distribution and a putative power law dependence for the out-degree distribution with a flat tail, in agreement with the data. The clustering coefficient, degreeâ€“degree correlation, rich club coefficient and k-core visualization all agree qualitatively with the empirical network to an extent not yet achieved by any other computational model, to our knowledge. The significant statistical differences can point the way to further research into non-adaptive and adaptive processes in the evolution of the E. coli GRN.}}

We show that this naturally leads to decomposing a queueing network into a set of Markov processes that jointly approximate the dynamics of the model and from which passage times are easily computed. Approximation accuracy of \{BE\} depends on the specific Bayesian network used to decompose the joint probability density. Hence, we propose a selection algorithm based on the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence to search for the Bayesian network that provides the most accurate results. Random models and case studies of increasing complexity show the significant accuracy gain of distribution estimates returned by \{BE\} compared to Markov and Chebyshev inequalities that are frequently used for percentile estimation in queueing networks.}}

Despite the inherent challenges of surviving in such a world, biological organisms evolve, self-organize, self-repair, navigate, and flourish. Generally, they do so with only local knowledge and without any centralized control. Our computer networks are increasingly facing similar challenges as they grow larger in size, but are yet to be able to achieve the same level of robustness and adaptability. Many research efforts have recognized these parallels, and wondered if there are some lessons to be learned from biological systems. As a result, biologically inspired research in computer networking is a quickly growing field. This article begins by exploring why biology and computer network research are such a natural match. We then present a broad overview of biologically inspired research, grouped by topic, and classified in two ways: by the biological field that inspired each topic, and by the area of networking in which the topic lies. In each case, we elucidate how biological concepts have been most successfully applied. In aggregate, we conclude that research efforts are most successful when they separate biological design from biological implementation â€“ that is to say, when they extract the pertinent principles from the former without imposing the limitations of the latter.}}

Extensive genetic analyses have identified the major regulators of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which control the development of all aerial organs. Among them, the three-amino-acid-loop-extension (TALE) class of homeoproteins has been shown to control meristem formation and/or maintenance, organ morphogenesis, organ position, and several aspects of the reproductive phase. This family contains the KNOTTED-like homeodomain (KNOX) and BEL1-like Homeodomain (BELL) members, which function as heterodimers. In this review, we have reported the functions of the \{TALE\} members throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. Genetic analyses revealed a complex network, as \{TALE\} members exhibit both overlapping and antagonistic activities. The characterization of a new \{KNOX\} member (KNATM), which lacks a homeodomain and interacts with other members to modulate their activities, adds another layer of complexity to this network. While the mode of action of these transcription factors is still largely unknown, they have been implicated in the regulation of several hormonal pathways, providing a link between gene regulatory networks and signaling in the SAM.}}

We show here that such an approach is valid for dissecting the responses of the \{AR2\} or \{GAD\} network of Escherichia coli K-12 to changes in pH, which is one of the most complex networks known in E. coli. In addition to confirming several regulatory interactions that have been revealed by previous studies, this approach has identified new components in this system that lead to complex dynamics of gene expression following a drop in pH, including an auto-regulatory loop involving the YdeO activator protein and novel roles for the PhoP protein.}}

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have long been regarded as primarily T helper cell type 1-mediated diseases. However, recent evidence suggests that \{TH17\} cells, a mostly unexplored subset of T helper cells, may be even more pathogenic than \{TH1\} cells. In the \{EAE\} model, this cell type is crucial for the recruitment of leukocytes into the \{CNS\} and for triggering parenchymal inflammation. In humans, \{TH17\} cells are found in acutely active and on the borders of chronically active lesions. Overall, CD4+ T cells only recognize antigens presented on \{MHC\} class \{II\} complexes, and these are seldom found in the CNS. \{MHC\} class I, in contrast, can be induced on neurons and myelin. This also makes CD8+ T cells promising candidates as effector cell types. Indeed, CD8+ T cells outnumber CD4+ T cells in the lesions of \{MS\} patients, and can induce axonal pathology. New data on B cells have likewise stimulated unconventional paths of reasoning about the disease. B cells can contribute to the pathogenesis by secreting autoantibodies and presenting antigens to T cells. By the formation of ectopic B cell aggregates in the CNS, B cell differentiation and response can take place remote from the periphery, thus autonomously fueling pathology. In addition, cells of the innate immune system including macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells are present in the inflamed CNS. On the one hand, these cells can recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), generating proinflammatory signals that trigger adaptive immune responses. On the other hand, these cells support the autoimmune process by the secretion of effector molecules such as nitric oxide (NO). Apart from a solely pathogenic autoimmune role, regulatory T cells, \{NK\} cells and \{NKT\} cells can suppress autoreactive cells. In this paper, we review data on how a complex network of immune mechanisms is involved in the pathogenesis of \{MS\} and EAE. We also critically reevaluate the traditional CD4/TH1 paradigm.}}

First, basic theoretical analysis is carried out for the case where for each agent the second-order dynamics are governed by the position and velocity terms and the asymptotic velocity is constant. A necessary and sufficient condition is given to ensure second-order consensus and it is found that both the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the corresponding network play key roles in reaching consensus. Based on this result, a second-order consensus algorithm is derived for the multi-agent system facing communication delays. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided, which shows that consensus can be achieved in a multi-agent system whose network topology contains a directed spanning tree if and only if the time delay is less than a critical value. Finally, simulation examples are given to verify the theoretical analysis.}}

In this paper, a unified synchronization criterion is derived for directed impulsive dynamical networks by proposing a concept named â€œaverage impulsive intervalâ€�. The derived criterion is theoretically and numerically proved to be less conservative than existing results. Numerical examples including scale-free and small-world structures are given to show that our results are applicable to large-scale networks.}}

Regulation of \{CD44\} interaction with its ligands depends greatly upon PKC. We investigated the effect of the treatment with high-molecular weight hyaluronan (HA) on diabetic nephropathy in genetically diabetic mice. BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb mice had elevated plasma insulin from 15 days of age and high blood sugar levels at 4 weeks. The severe nephropathy that developed was characterized by a marked increased in \{CD44\} receptors, protein kinase C betaI, betaII, and epsilon (PKCÎ²I, PKCÎ²II, and PKCÎµ) mRNA expression and the related protein products in kidney tissue. High levels of mRNA and related protein levels were also detected in the damaged kidney for NF-ÎºB, TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-18, MMP-7, and iNOS. Chronic daily administration of high-molecular mass \{HA\} for 2 weeks significantly reduced CD44, PKCÎ²I, PKCÎ²II, and PKCÎ± gene expression and the related protein production in kidney tissue and TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-18, MMP-7, and iNOS expression and levels also decreased. Histological analysis confirmed the biochemical data. However, blood parameters of diabetes were unchanged. These results suggest that the \{CD44\} and \{PKC\} play an important role in diabetes and interaction of high-molecular weight \{HA\} with these proteins may reduce inflammation and secondary pathologies due to this disease.}}

In this paper, we shall demonstrate that the Optimal and Information Theoretic (OIT) model of Oommen and Kashyap [22] applicable for syntactic pattern recognition can be used to tackle peptide classification problem. We advocate that one can model the differences between compared strings as a mutation model consisting of random substitutions, insertions and deletions obeying the \{OIT\} model. Thus, in this paper, we show that the probability measure obtained from the \{OIT\} model can be perceived as a sequence similarity metric, using which a support vector machine (SVM)-based peptide classifier can be devised. The classifier, which we have built has been tested for eight different substitution matrices and for two different data sets, namely, the HIV-1 Protease cleavage sites and the T-cell epitopes. The results show that the \{OIT\} model performs significantly better than the one which uses a Needlemanâ€“Wunsch sequence alignment score, it is less sensitive to the substitution matrix than the other methods compared, and that when combined with a SVM, is among the best peptide classification methods available.}}

abstract = {Regulatory relations between biological molecules constitute complex network systems and realize diverse biological functions through the dynamics of molecular activities. However, we currently have very little understanding of the relationship between the structure of a regulatory network and its dynamical properties. In this paper we introduce a new method, named â€œlinkage logicâ€� to analyze the dynamics of network systems. By this method, we can restrict possible steady states of a given complex network system from the knowledge of regulatory linkages alone. The regulatory linkage simply specifies the list of variables that affect the dynamics of each variable. We formalize two aspects of the linkage logic: the â€œPrinciple of Compatibilityâ€� determines the upper limit of the diversity of possible steady states of the dynamics realized by a given network; the â€œPrinciple of Dependencyâ€� determines the possible combinations of states of the system. By combining these two aspects, (i) for a given network, we can identify a cluster of nodes that gives an alternative representation of the steady states of the whole system, (ii) we can reduce a given complex network into a simpler one without loss of the ability to generate the diversity of steady states, (iii) we can examine the consistency between the structure of network and observed set of steady states, and (iv) sometimes we can predict unknown states or unknown regulations from an observed set of steady states alone. We illustrate the method by several applications to an experimentally determined regulatory network for biological functions.}}

The jumping parameters are modeled as a continuous-time, finite-state Markov chain. By employing the Lyapunovâ€“Krasovskii functional and stochastic analysis theory as well as linear matrix inequality technique, some novel sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point in the mean square. The proposed model of neutral type is quite general since many factors such as noise perturbations, Markovian jump parameters and mixed time delays are considered in this paper. The activation functions in this paper may be neither monotonically increasing nor continuously differentiable, and they are more general than those usual Lipschitz conditions. The results obtained in this paper comprise and generalize those given in the previous literature. Two numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.}}

Here we apply an error minimization technique to train the networks and mathematically derive a corresponding back-propagation learning rule based on the error regression, which seeks to minimize the error combination of the output means and variances of networks. As a result, we present a more biologically plausible so-called second order spiking perceptron (SOSP). We show through various examples that such system, even a single neuron, is able to perform various complex non-linear tasks like the \{XOR\} problem which is impossible to be solved by traditional single-layer perceptrons. Moreover such perceptron can be trained to implement a practical and classical dynamic learning task: simulating the trajectory of an arm movement. Among including the second order statistics in computations, such perceptron offers a significant advantage over their predecessors, in that it involves the learning accuracy of output variance by directly introducing the variance term in the error presentation. Thus we can train not only the output bias (mean error) but also the output noises (variances), and also can reach the trade-off between the output bias and output variance by the adjustment of the penalty factor in error function, due to a specific learning task. Indeed, this is the most important advantage over other kinds of spiking neural networks in existent.}}

Cancer cell cytoskeleton is complex network of interwoven protein fibers composed of microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments.

In this study, morphological and cytoskeletal changes induced by \{AEE788\} and/or Celecoxib on colon cancer cell \{HCT\} 15 were analyzed using advanced microscopic techniques. Cell proliferation assay was used for determining \{IC50\} of \{AEE788\} and/or Celecoxib on \{HCT\} 15. Confocal microscopic analysis of \{AEE788\} and/or Celecoxib treated \{HCT\} 15 was performed using Rhodamine-Phalloidin (actin stain) and Hoechst 33342 (nuclear stain). Atomic force (AFM) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies were also performed to analyze cell morphology and cell wall extension (filopodia and lamellipodia). In addition, quantitative analysis of morphological parameters was studied using cellular image processing technique. This is the first report that combination of \{AEE788\} and Celecoxib additively increase growth inhibition and cell death on human colon cancer cell \{HCT\} 15 as estimated by cell proliferation assay. Morphological analysis of \{AEE788\} or Celecoxib treated \{HCT\} 15 cell for 24 h have not revealed significant change in morphology under phase contrast microscopy. But, slight morphological changes were observed in combination (AEE788 + Celecoxib) treated \{HCT\} 15 for 24 h. In contrast, high resolution confocal laser fluorescence and atomic force microscopic studies have revealed cell shrinkage, disorganized actin filament and, loss of filopodia and lamellipodia. These changes were more prominent in combination of \{AEE788\} and Celecoxib treated \{HCT\} 15 than either drug alone. These results may suggest antiproliferative and antimetastatic activity of \{AEE788\} and/or Celecoxib. Quantitative analysis of morphological parameters using cellular image processing technique have shown decrease in mean area, perimeter, compactness and eccentricity of combination drug treated cells than either drug alone. These results further support the confocal and \{AFM\} study. Scanning electron microscopic study of \{AEE788\} and/or Celecoxib treated \{HCT\} 15 has also shown morphological changes and loss of filopodia and lamellipodia. In conclusion, this investigation of morphological and cytoskeletal changes using advanced microscopic techniques present a significant foundation for evaluating anticancer activity of a drug and form a new strategy for evaluating effect of \{AEE788\} and/or Celecoxib on colon cancer.}}

abstract = {During the last decade evidence has accumulated that the aging process is driven by limited allocation of energy to somatic maintenance resulting in accumulation of stochastic damage. This damage, affecting molecules, cells, and tissues, is counteracted by genetically programmed repair, the efficiency of which thus importantly determines the life and â€˜health spanâ€™ of organisms. Therefore, understanding the regulation of gene expression during cellular and organismal aging as well as upon exposure to various damaging events is important to understand the biology of aging and to positively influence the health span. The recent identification of small non-coding \{RNAs\} (ncRNAs), has added an additional layer of complexity to the regulation of gene expression with the classes of endogenous small inhibitory \{RNAs\} (siRNAs), PIWI-interacting \{RNAs\} (piRNAs), QDE1-interacting \{RNAs\} (qiRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Some of these ncRNAs have not yet been identified in mammalian cells and are dependent on RNA-dependent \{RNA\} polymerases. The first mammalian enzyme with such activity has only now emerged and surprisingly consists of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) together with RMPR, an alternative \{RNA\} component. The so far most studied small non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, however, are now increasingly found to operate in the complex network of cellular aging. Recent findings show that (i) miRNAs are regulated during cellular senescence in vitro, (ii) they contribute to tissue regeneration by regulation of stem cell function, and (iii) at least one miRNA modulates the life span of the model organism C. elegans. Additionally, (iv) they act as inhibitors of proteins mediating the insulin/IGF1 and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling, both of which are conserved modulators of organism life span. Here we will give an overview on the current status of these topics. Since little is so far known on the functions of small ncRNAs in the context of aging and longevity, the entry of the \{RNA\} world into the field of biogerontology certainly holds additional surprises and promises. Even more so, as miRNAs are implicated in many age-associated pathologies, and as \{RNAi\} and miRNA based therapeutics are on their way to clinics.}}

The association of \{ATP\} and GroES to a polypeptide-bound ring of GroEL encapsulates the folding proteins in the central cavity of that ring (cis ring) and allows it to fold in a protected environment where the risk of aggregation is reduced. \{ATP\} hydrolysis in the cis ring changes the potentials within the system such that \{ATP\} binding to the opposite (trans) ring triggers the release of all ligands from the cis ring of GroEL through a complex network of allosteric communication between the rings. Inter-ring allosteric communication thus appears indispensable for the function of GroEL, and an engineered single-ring version (SR1) cannot substitute for GroEL in vivo. We describe here the isolation and characterisation of an active single-ring form of the GroEL protein (SR-A92T), which has an exceptionally low \{ATPase\} activity that is strongly stimulated by the addition of GroES. Dissection of the kinetic pathway of the ATP-induced structural changes in this active single ring can be explained by the fact that the mutation effectively blocks progression through the full allosteric pathway of the GroEL reaction cycle, thus trapping an early allosteric intermediate. Addition of GroES is able to overcome this block by binding this intermediate and pulling the allosteric pathway to completion via mass action, explaining how bacterial cells expressing this protein as their only chaperonin are viable.}}

The time delay is assumed to be a time-varying continuous function belonging to a given range. Firstly, some new delay-range-dependent stability and stabilization criteria are proposed by exploiting a new Lyapunovâ€“Krasovskii functional and by making use of novel techniques for time-delay systems. These developed results enjoy much less conservatism than the existing ones due to the introduction of some free weighting matrices and a method to estimate the upper bound of the derivative of Lyapunov functional without ignoring some useful terms that take into account information of the lower and upper bounds for the time delay. Secondly, based on the criteria obtained, a delay-range-dependent criterion for the existence of a memoryless state feedback Hâˆž controller that ensures asymptotic stability and a prescribed Hâˆž performance level of the closed-loop system for all admissible uncertainties is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method.}}

Furthermore, adhoc grids composed of wirelessly networked portable devices are emerging as a new paradigm in grid computing. In this paper we review computational and algorithmic challenges of high-fidelity simulations of such WiFi-based wireless communication and computing networks, including scalable topology maintenance, mobility modelling, parallelisation and synchronisation. We explore similarities and differences between the simulations of these networks and simulations of interacting many-particle systems, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show how the cell linked-list algorithm which we have adapted from our \{MD\} simulations can be used to greatly improve the computational performance of wireless network simulators in the presence of mobility, and illustrate with an example from our simulation studies of worm attacks on mobile wireless adhoc networks.}}

Studying complex natural systems, scientists usually find that simple local dynamics lead to sophisticated macroscopic structures and behaviour. It seems that some kind of local interaction rules naturally allow the system to auto-organize itself as an efficient and robust structure, which can easily solve different tasks. Examples of such complex systems are social networks, where a small set of basic interaction rules leads to a relatively robust and efficient communication structure. In this paper, we present PROSA, a semantic peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network inspired by social dynamics. The way queries are forwarded and links among peers are established in \{PROSA\} resemble the way people ask other people for collaboration, help or information. Behaving as a social network of peers, \{PROSA\} naturally evolves to a small world, where all peers can be reached in a fast and efficient way. The underlying algorithm used for query forwarding, based only on local choices, is both reliable and effective: peers sharing similar resources are eventually connected with each other, allowing queries to be successfully answered in a really small amount of time. The resulting emergent structure can guarantee fast responses and good query recall.}}

Connections in biological neural networks might fluctuate over time; therefore, surveillance can provide a more useful picture of brain dynamics than the standard approach that relies on a static graph to represent functional connectivity. Using the application of well-known measures of neural synchrony over short segments of brain activity in a time series, we attempted a time-dependent characterization of brain connectivity by investigating functional segregation and integration. In our implementation, a frequency-dependent time window was employed and regularly spaced (defined as overlapping segments), and a novel, parameter-free method was introduced to derive the required adjacency matrices. The resulting characterization was compared against conventional approaches that rely on static and time-evolving graphs, which are constructed from non-overlapping segments of arbitrarily defined durations. Our approach is demonstrated using \{EEG\} recordings during mental calculations. The derived consecutive values of network metrics were then compared with values from randomized networks. The results revealed the dynamic small-world character of the brain's functional connectivity, which otherwise can be hidden from estimators that rely on either long or stringent time-windows. Moreover, by involving a network-metric time series (NMTS) in a summarizing procedure that was based on replicator dynamics, consistent hubs that facilitated communication in the underlying networks were identified. Finally, the scale-free character of brain networks was also demonstrated based on the significant edges selected with the introduced approach.}}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a completely distributed topology generation mechanism named \{HPC5\} for Gnutella network. A Gnutella topology will be efficient and scalable if it generates less number of redundant queries. This can be achieved if it consists of a fewer number of short length cycles. Based on this principle, our protocol directs each peer to select neighbors in such a way that any cyclic path present in the overlay network will not generate any redundant query. We show that our approach can be deployed into the existing Gnutella network without disturbing any of its parameters. We also show that the probability of inconsistencies arising during topology generation, using our mechanism, which may lead to the formation of a small number of short length cycles is very low. However, we have also proposed an inconsistency handling protocol that detects such short length cycles and effectively removes them. We implemented a Gnutella prototype to compare and validate the efficiency of our protocol over existing Gnutella. Simulation results indicate that our mechanism outperforms existing Gnutella in terms of network coverage (the number of unique peers explored during query propagation in limited flooding) and message complexity. Structural analysis indicates that the proposed enhancement conserves the robustness of existing Gnutella network. Finally, we draw comparisons of the proposed protocol with a state-of-the-art topology optimization protocol named Distributed Cycle Minimization Protocol (DCMP); the simulation results indicate that \{HPC5\} outperforms \{DCMP\} in terms of message overhead and network coverage.}}

Recoverable attacks refer to a class of attacks that the network can recover from after a period of time. To facilitate the investigation of the synchronization of a \{CDN\} under â€˜successfulâ€™ but recoverable attacks, the attack frequency and the average recovering time are introduced. By using a piecewise Lyapunov function, the upper bounds of the attack frequency and the average recovering time are obtained to ensure that the whole network can achieve global synchronization under attacks.}}

We describe an extension of the deterministic metabolic control analysis (MCA) to the stochastic regime. We introduce stochastic sensitivities for mean and covariance values of reactant concentrations and reaction fluxes and show that there exist MCA-like summation theorems among these sensitivities. The summation theorems for flux variances is shown to depend on the size of the measurement time window (Ïµ) within which reaction events are counted for measuring a single flux. It is found that the degree of the Ïµ-dependency can become significant for processes involving multi-time-scale dynamics and is estimated by introducing a new measure of time-scale separation. This Ïµ-dependency is shown to be closely related to the power-law scaling observed in flux fluctuations in various complex networks.}}

One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.}}

Application of this toolbox led to blueprints of a \{CO2\} infrastructure in the Netherlands. The results show that in a scenario with 20% and 50% \{CO2\} emissions reduction targets compared to their 1990 level in respectively 2020 and 2050, an infrastructure of around 600Â km of \{CO2\} trunklines may need to be built before 2020. Investment costs for the pipeline construction and the storage site development amount to around 720Â mâ‚¬ and 340Â mâ‚¬, respectively. The results also show the implication of policy choices such as allowing or prohibiting \{CO2\} storage onshore on \{CO2\} Capture and Storage (CCS) and infrastructure development. This paper illustrates how the ArcGIS/MARKAL-based toolbox can provide insights into a \{CCS\} infrastructure development, and support policy makers by giving concrete blueprints over time with respect to scale, pipeline trajectories, and deployment of individual storage sites.}}

Following this rationale, centrality measures can be used to (i) identify keystone species in ecological networks, a major issue in community ecology, and (ii) differentiate the keystone species concept, e.g. species may play a key role in a network for different topological reasons. In 34 pollination communities we examine the relationship between the generalization level of species (ND) and two complementary centrality indices: closeness (CC) and betweenness centrality (BC). \{CC\} measures the proximity of a species to all other species in the community, while \{BC\} describes the importance of a species as a connector. Most networks had a linear NDâ€“CC relationship with a minimum \{CC\} value of 0.41. Hence, species were close to each and will be likely to be rapidly affected by disturbances. Contrarily, in most networks, the NDâ€“BC relationships were power-law distributed with exponents larger than one. Only 59% of the species were connectors (BC &gt; 0). In particular, there was a connector threshold value of \{ND\} = 0.46. Species above this threshold represent âˆ¼40%, almost all of which were connectors. These results indicate that in pollination systems the most generalized species are usually network keystone species, playing at least two roles: (i) interact closely with most other species (high CC) and (ii) connect otherwise unconnected subnetworks (high BC). We discuss the implications of centrality measures to community-based conservation ecology.}}

Often these networks have also a modular and self-similar structure and, in some cases â€” usually associated with topological restrictions â€” their clustering is low and they are almost planar. In this paper we introduce a family of graphs which share all these properties and are defined by two parameters. As their construction is deterministic, we obtain exact analytic expressions for relevant properties of the graphs including the degree distribution, degree correlation, diameter, and average distance, as a function of the two defining parameters. Thus, the graphs are useful to model some complex networks, in particular several families of technological and biological networks, and in the design of new practical communication algorithms in relation to their dynamical processes. They can also help understanding the underlying mechanisms that have produced their particular structure.}}

It is used by urban decision-makers to create symbolic and economic values, which are often considered as a competitive advantage for cities. Nevertheless, when so many cities are using the same strategies, to what extent does culture-led planning allow a city to distinguish itself? Here, we ask whether alternative cultures can lead to an urban resistance against these sanitised and homogenised cityscapes. Alternative cultures provide both cultural spaces and unique urban experiences, but can also give a place a new type of symbolic value. How can these alternative cultures be used by planners to pioneer urban regeneration projects? How are they influenced by cultural policies? Are they attracting other urbanites, such as the gentrification theories argue, or do they reveal a large diffusion of conditions of works and constraints in everyday life? Based on several examples in Paris, this paper intends to show the shift in the attitude of planners and authorities toward what we call off cultural scenes. Increasingly, these decision-makers are accepting of and entering into discussions with off artists, using them as pioneers in urban developments and copying their approach in new cultural projects. Many of these changes illustrate the willingness of the current mayor of Paris to promote the city as a creative and open place to work, invest, create and live. Later, this paper will analyse these changes with respect to three case studies and address several questions: How does the presence of off artist spaces help to balance an overly sanitised urban project? What is the value of these off spaces to cultural planning? How do off spaces, such as artist squats, inspire new cultural policies? Do off cultural scenes promote or generate gentrification or, rather, reveal a global socio-economic trend which re-valorises inner-city locations? Finally, our work here leads to a reappraisal and serves as a reminder of the importance of serendipity in urban life and, thus, in urban planning.}}

However, numerous existing techniques that have been proposed to facilitate the design often lack the robustness and reliability needed to rigorously solve the problem, largely due to simplifying assumptions. In this contribution, we present computational methods which exploit a novel thermodynamically motivated problem transformation, entitled temperature collocation, rather than using classical tray-by-tray models which fail in pinched regions. This novel methodology applies to ideal, non-ideal and azeotropic mixtures, and is independent of the number of components. Due to the generalised nature of the method, we have also addressed the synthesis of complex column configurations as well as heat integration of distillation trains. Furthermore, the robust synthesis algorithm is presented, a method that automatically synthesizes a distillation network for given product purity requirements. Entire separation flowsheets are generated with rigorous thermodynamic models without the need to introduce limiting simplifications as is the case with existing shortcut techniques. The computational approach guarantees to identify realizable columns with a finite number of trays and operating conditions, which may easily be validated with industrial flowsheet simulator software packages like AspenPlus.}}

In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that the decision to enter into an \{FTA\} is also crucially dependent on the participating countries' existing \{FTA\} relationships with third countries. Accounting for the interdependence of \{FTAs\} helps to explain a significant fraction of \{FTA\} formations that would not otherwise be predicted by countries' economic characteristics.}}

NS-2 simulation results show that, compared to an aggressive transmission strategy, our method can greatly reduce bandwidth consumption and, compared to a simple rebuffering strategy with the same bandwidth consumption, our method can effectively reduce total playback delay while also reducing the number of rebuffering events.}}

The robustness gain to delay is analyzed for variable network topologies with the same size. The characteristics of dramatic increase for the algebraic connectivity and slightly increase for the robustness gain to delay are unfolded in \{SPBA\} network.

In order to adequately evaluate such sourcing decision and ensure that tasks can be assigned appropriately, this article proposes a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to achieve effective problem-solving by combining the following three methods: decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), analytical network process (ANP), and zero-one goal programming (ZOGP). The final research results reveal that an organization can â€“ simultaneously â€“ not only take advantage of its internal or external resources to set priorities for task arrangements within the portfolio of sourcing decisions, but also optimize operating strategy and management despite limited resources after consulting with the expert panel.}}

Analytical results are derived using the mean-field theory and it is observed that the diversity of anti-attack of nodes in scale-free networks can increase effectively the threshold of epidemic propagation. The simulation results agree with the analytical results. The results show that the vulnerability functions can help adopt appropriate immunization strategies.}}

In the present work, we investigate the exponential synchronization of weighted general delay coupled and non-delay coupled complex dynamical networks with different topological structures. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the suitable controllers are designed to make the controlled dynamical network exponentially synchronize an isolated node with any pre-specified exponential convergence rate, and proved theoretically. The synchronization scheme is applicable to the undirected networks as well as the directed ones. The derived controllers are simple and can be readily used in practical applications. Furthermore, the coupling matrix is not necessary to be irreducible and the network node dynamics need not satisfy the very strong and conservative uniform Lipschitz condition. Numerical simulations further validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our synchronization method.}}

Based on graph theory, matrix theory, and LaSalleâ€™s invariance principle, a pinning control algorithm is proposed to achieve leader-following consensus in a network of agents with nonlinear second-order dynamics. Furthermore, a pinning consensus protocol is developed for coupled double-integrators with a constant reference velocity. In particular, this paper addresses what kind of agents and how many agents should be pinned, and establishes some sufficient conditions to guarantee that all agents asymptotically follow the virtual leader. Numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical analysis.}}

Herein we propose a statistical habituation model (SHM); a phenomenological model based on a generalization of linear response theory and discrete events. The \{SHM\} suggests that the fundamental mechanism producing habituation in its myriad of forms, as well as the associated dishabituation, is the 1 / f -noise that is generically produced in complex neuronal networks.}}

On the basis of massive research of the congestion control issues, there is the generalization of the end-to-end protocol and intermediate nodes. Some open problems have been discussed for the further research of network congestion control.}}

As an example, the upper bound of the coupling delay for a Duffing system is obtained, and is larger than those reported previously. Finally, some simulation results obtained with different outer-coupling matrices are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results that we obtained, and these are compared with existing conclusions to show the advantage of our results.}}

Nevertheless, the world's ecosystems are currently exposed to a fast wave of species extinctions, and nature conservancy research has to face the challenge of predicting the consequences of extinctions. In the context of complex food webs that compose natural ecosystems, these primary extinctions affect the biomasses and growth rates of all co-existing species, which can eventually lead to secondary extinctions and extinction cascades of multiple species. Network theory provides a tool for predicting the consequences of extinctions for other species and ecosystem functions. In this sense, ecological network theory could become the next cornerstone of nature conservancy research.}}

Our results show significant differences in factors like the degree and the diameter of the networks.

abstract = {The effective connectivity between input and output channels in complex coupled networks based on the transfer of electro-magnetic waves (RF, microwave or optical) plays an important role in many fields. The transfer of the waves between connected nodes in complex coupled networks is strongly influenced by the presence of non-reciprocal feedback channels with uni-directional amplification. The introduction of such non-reciprocal channels breaks the time reversal invariance of the connectivity matrix between the input and the output channels of the network. The feedback channels are intrinsically changing the spectral properties of the connectivity matrix and hence the associated static and dynamic transfer properties of the ingoing and outgoing ports of the network. Here we use a random matrix model to represent the complex and fully chaotic network without feedback. Extra feedback connections are introduced that change the reciprocity and time reversal invariance of the reference network and hence the connectivity. Exploiting a modern electrical engineering description of multi-port complex circuits in terms of the S-matrix of internal multi-port sections, we show by computer simulations the influence of feedback for increasing network complexity. The results are interpreted using a random matrix approach for the multi-port connectivity matrix. The effect of amplifying bi-directional or uni-directional connecting loop on the properties of the resulting S-matrix are computed for increasing network size. The signal transfer capacity of a multi channel the network based on the Smatrix shows for smaller networks a strong influence of the extra connected loop. In particular for the uni-directional amplifying feedback loop.}}

By reconstructing the limit order book, we can extract detailed information of each executed order for each trading day and demonstrate that the trade size distributions for different trading days exhibit power-law tails and that most of the estimated power-law exponents are well within the LÃ©vy stable regime. Based on the records of order matching among investors, we can construct a stock trading network for each trading day, in which the investors are mapped into nodes and each transaction is translated as a direct edge from the seller to the buyer with the trade size as its weight. We find that all the trading networks comprise a giant component and have power-law degree distributions and disassortative architectures. In particular, the degrees are correlated with order sizes by a power-law function. By regarding the size of executed order as its fitness, the fitness model can reproduce the empirical power-law degree distribution.}}

abstract = {Mammalian vertebrae, ribs, body wall musculature and back skin develop from repetitive embryonic tissues called somites. The development of somites depends on the molecular oscillations of the products of so-called cyclic genes. The underlying network involves the Wnt, Fgf/Mapk, Notch signaling pathways and the T-box genes. The discovery of this network is based on genetic interactions. Because of regulatory feedbacks and cross-regulation between pathways, it is often difficult to intuitively identify direct molecular interactions underlying genetic interactions. To address this problem, we developed a method based on a database and graph theory algorithms. We first encoded genetic and non-genetic experiments in a relational database. Next, we built a reference network with the data from non-genetic experiments and the \{KEGG\} pathway database. Then, we computed the shortest path between the nodes for each genetic interaction in the reference network to propose direct molecular interactions. The resulting network is the largest computational representation of the mammalian segmentation network to date with 36 nodes and 57 interactions. In some instances, a number of genetic interactions could be explained by adding a single link to the reference network, which leads to experimentally testable hypotheses. Two examples of such predictions are the direct transcriptional regulation of Dll3 and Fgf8 genes by the Rbpj and Ctnnb1 products, respectively. Furthermore, the computed shortest paths suggest that cross-talks from the Wnt to the Fgf/Mapk and Notch pathways might be mediated by the Dvl genes. This method can be applied in any system where gene expression changes are observed as a response to some gene perturbation, for instance in cancer cells.}}

Previously, it was shown to be a \{DNA\} binding protein and was hypothesized to participate in the viral \{DNA\} packaging process. Using Atomic Force Microscopy imaging, we show that the viral \{DNA\} is associated with a (or more) capsid proteins. The organized viral \{DNA\} qualitatively resembles the conformations of \{VP15\} induced \{DNA\} condensates in vitro. Furthermore, single-DNA manipulation experiments revealed that \{VP15\} is able to condense single \{DNA\} against forces of a few pico Newtons. Our results suggest that \{VP15\} may aid in the viral \{DNA\} packaging process by directly condensing DNA.}}

Through simulation analysis of the interbank network model, some typical structural features are identified in our interbank network, which are also proved to exist in real interbank networks. They are namely, a low clustering coefficient and a relatively short average path length, community structures, and a two-power-law distribution of out-degree and in-degree.}}

Experimental results on \{PPI\} networks from \{DIP\} data and \{MIPS\} data indicate that each similarity graph shows its strengths and disadvantages, and our finding of the number of clusters improves the clustering quality. Finally, spectral clustering obtains results in detecting protein complexes that are comparable to those obtained from several other typical algorithms.}}

Our phylogenetic results based on network alignment and motif identification supported the endosymbiotic theory from the point of view of systems biology for the first time. It was found that the mitochondrial metabolic network were much more compact than the relative species, probably related to the higher efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation of the specialized organelle, and the network is highly clustered around the \{TCA\} cycle. Moreover, the mitochondrial metabolic network exhibited high functional specificity to the modules. This work provided insight to the understanding of mitochondria evolution, and the organization principle of mitochondrial metabolic network at the network level.}}

abstract = {Oribatid mite borings and coprolites are described for the first time from the Permian of the northern Helan Mountains, in the Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol) and Ningxia Huizu Autonomous Regions, northern China. To our knowledge, they are the first reported mite borings and coprolites from the Cathaysian Palaeozoic. They occur in petrified gymnospermous woods from five stratigraphic horizons within three formations: the Cisuralian Shanxi, Guadalupian Lower Shihhotse and the Lopingian Sunjiagou Formations. The borings and galleries are interpreted as trunk tunnels and their secondary branches, which are interconnected to form a complicated maze-like network. Two kinds of coprolite can be recognized based on their dimensions, shape and density of composition. One form is about 20â€“65 Âµm in diameter and of spheroidal shape, whereas the other is about 37.5â€“70 Âµm Ã— 55â€“145 Âµm and ovoid in shape. The smaller form of coprolite is densely compacted and occurs in all five horizons. The larger form shows a fairly loosely organized texture and occurs only in the Cisuralian age wood. This report of Palaeozoic wood-borers and their coprolites from the Cathaysian flora is consistent with previous data on the palaeogeographical distribution and stratigraphic occurrences of plantâ€“arthropod interactions.}}

As the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks depends on their structure, here we attempt to determine structural reasons which, despite the similarities in global network properties, may explain the large differences in organismal complexity. We demonstrate that the algebraic connectivity, the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue of the Laplacian, of the directed gene regulatory networks decreases with the increase of organismal complexity, and may therefore explain the difference between the variety of analyzed regulatory networks. In addition, our results point out that, for the species considered in this study, evolution favours decreasing concentration of strategically positioned feed forward loops, so that the network as a whole can increase the specificity towards changing environments. Moreover, contrary to the existing results, we show that the average degree, the length of the longest cascade, and the average cascade length of gene regulatory networks cannot recover the evolutionary relationships between organisms. Whereas the dynamical properties of special subnetworks are relatively well understood, there is still limited knowledge about the evolutionary reasons for the already identified design principles pertaining to these special subnetworks, underlying the global quantitative features of gene regulatory networks of different organisms. The behavior of the algebraic connectivity, which we show valid on gene regulatory networks extracted from curated databases, can serve as an additional evolutionary principle of organism-specific regulatory networks.}}

A time-dependent minimum path approach is employed to calculate the minimum travel time between each pair of airports in the three networks, inclusive of flight times and waiting times in intermediate airports. We evaluate each fastest indirect connection in terms of waiting times and routing factors to consider the effect of the hubsâ€™ coordination and locations. The Chinese network provides the quickest travels for passengers, but this performance is explained by a small number of airports per inhabitant. The \{US\} network is the most coordinated when considering indirect connections. The \{EU\} network provides the most homogeneous level of service when comparing airports of different sizes.}}

A marketing implication is that the choice of initial target groups and their network structures matter in influencing whether an innovation makes full or partial penetration, in markets where network effects plays a role.}}

We study the dynamics of a four species network consisting of two weakly connected predatorâ€“prey pairs. We focus our analysis on the effects of the cross interaction between the predator of the first pair and the prey of the second pair. This is an example where the predator overlap, which is the proportion of predators that a given prey shares with other preys, is not uniform across the network due to asymmetries in patterns of interaction. We explore the behavior of the system under different interaction strengths and study the dynamics of survival and extinction. In particular, we consider situations in which the four species have initial populations lower than their long-term equilibrium, simulating catastrophic situations in which their abundances are reduced due to human action or environmental change. We show that, under these reduced initial conditions, and depending on the strength of the cross interaction, the populations tend to oscillate before re-equilibrating, disturbing the community equilibrium and sometimes reaching values that are only a small fraction of the equilibrium population, potentially leading to their extinction. We predict that, contrary to oneâ€™s intuition, the most likely scenario is the extinction of the less predated preys.}}

People in different areas view semantics from different facets although it accompanies interaction through civilization. Some researchers believe that humans have some innate structure in mind for processing semantics. Then, what the structure is like? Some argue that humans evolve a structure for processing semantics through constant learning. Then, how the process is like? Humans have invented various symbol systems to represent semantics. Can semantics be accurately represented? Turing machines are good at processing symbols according to algorithms designed by humans, but they are limited in ability to process semantics and to do active interaction. Super computers and high-speed networks do not help solve this issue as they do not have any semantic worldview and cannot reflect themselves. Can future cyber-society have some semantic images that enable machines and individuals (humans and agents) to reflect themselves and interact with each other with knowing social situation through time? This paper concerns these issues in the context of studying an interactive semantics for the future cyber-society. It firstly distinguishes social semantics from natural semantics, and then explores the interactive semantics in the category of social semantics. Interactive semantics consists of an interactive system and its semantic image, which co-evolve and influence each other. The semantic worldview and interactive semantic base are proposed as the semantic basis of interaction. The process of building and explaining semantic image can be based on an evolving structure incorporating adaptive multi-dimensional classification space and self-organized semantic link network. A semantic lens is proposed to enhance the potential of the structure and help individuals build and retrieve semantic images from different facets, abstraction levels and scales through time.}}

We derive the threshold for the epidemic to be zero in infinite scale-free network. For a hard cut off scale-free network, we also prove the stability of disease-free equilibrium and the persistence of \{STDs\} infection. The effects of two immunization schemes, including proportional scheme and targeted vaccination, are studied and compared. We find that targeted strategy compare favorably to a proportional scheme in terms of effectiveness. Theory and simulations both prove that an appropriate condom using has prominent effect to control \{STDs\} spread on scale-free networks.}}

Computed tomography imaging showed a large pelvic arteriovenous malformation that consisted of multiple fine shunts between the left internal iliac artery and the long segment of the left external iliac vein. A stent graft was inserted within the left external iliac vein to occlude the arteriovenous shunts with consecutive transarterial sclerotherapy using absolute ethanol. This resulted in complete resolution of the pelvic arteriovenous malformation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of stent graft insertion within a large vein for treating arteriovenous malformation.}}

Hyperhomocysteinemia is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis and thrombotic disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that homocysteine (Hcy) enhances productions of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the light of these findings, we decided to determine if any relationship exists between IL-2 and IL-6, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, and total homocysteine (tHcy) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A total of 102 patients with \{ACS\} and 90 healthy subjects were included in the study. The levels of tHcy, IL-2 and IL-6 were higher and folic acid was lower in patients as compared with those of controls. Furthermore, data of the area under \{ROC\} plot for IL-2 demonstrated that IL-2 had higher sensitivity. These data suggest that enhanced inflammation may be associated with tHcy-related cardiovascular disease.}}

For instance, Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of Malaria and kills up to 2.7 million people annually whereas Plasmodium vivax is geographically the most widely distributed cause with more than 80 million clinical cases. Due to drug resistance and toxicity, discovering novel drug targets is mandatory; such as Proteinâ€“Protein Complexes unique in this pathogen and not present in human host (pPPCs). Additionally, the 3D structure of an increasing number of Plasmodium proteins is being reported in public databases making easier the development of bioinformatics models to predict pPPCs. In addition, some \{PPCs\} expressed both in parasite and human, such as \{DHFR\} synthase, play a significant role in drug resistance in both Malaria and Human Cancer. However, there are no general models to predict pPPCs using indices of \{PPC\} biopolymer structure. Therefore, we introduced herein new Markov Chain numerical descriptors of proteinâ€“protein Interactions (PPIs) based on electrostatic entropy measures and calculated these parameters for 5257 pairs of proteins (774 pPPCs and 4483 non-pPPCs) from more than 20 organisms, including parasite and human hosts. We found a simple Classification Tree with high Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity (90.2â€“98.5%) both in training and independent test sub-sets and implemented this predictor in the user-friendly web server PlasmodPPI freely available at http://miaja.tic.udc.es/Bio-AIMS/PlasmodPPI.php.}}

A recent study identifying the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (LA, C18:2) as the endogenous, reversible ligand for HNF4Î± suggests that HNF4Î± may also be a potential drug target and that its activity may be regulated by diet. This review will discuss the role of HNF4Î± in drug metabolism, including the genes it regulates, the factors that regulate its activity, and its potential as a drug target.}}

Simulations show that the network capacity and the communication velocity are improved. However, some packets are dropped before they arrived at destinations. It is found that the share of successfully arrived packets monotonously increases with the increment of \{TTL\} and it is considerably acceptable if \{TTL\} is not very small. We also examine the effect of \{TTL\} on the positive-feedback preference (PFP) internet model and the results are alike. Our work may be helpful in quantifying the effect of packet lifetime in real communication networks and in routing strategy designing.}}

In the study, the resource allocation and routing algorithm are the critical part of \{PCE\} hierarchy. To compare the performance of new architecture and the traditional one, the user uses the flooding suppression, routing delay, resource utilization and traffic blocking probability as performance simulation parameters and taking the verification simulation on objective modular network testbed (OMNeT) platform against to source-node routing architecture. The numerical analysis, computer simulation and experiment work indicate that the operation of PCE-based routing architecture can reduce the flooding information of path calculation request as well as the routing hops significantly and improve the quality of service (QoS) by decreasing the blocking probability when failure happened.}}

The chromatin exists as a dynamic entity, shuttling between the open and closed forms at specific nuclear regions and loci based on the requirement of the cell. This dynamicity is essential for the various DNA-templated phenomena like transcription, replication, and repair and is achieved through the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and covalent modifiers of chromatin. A growing body of data indicates that chromatin enzymatic activities are finely and specifically regulated by a variety of small molecules derived from the intermediary metabolism. This review tries to summarize the work conducted in many laboratories and on different model organisms showing how ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are regulated by small molecules and metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and inositol polyphosphates (IPs).}}

It assumes that after each round of playing, players whose payoffs are below a certain threshold will be eliminated from the game and the same number of new nodes will be added to the network to maintain the size of the network constant. Numerical results show that moderate values of elimination threshold can result in a maximum cooperation level in the evolutionary prisonerâ€™s dilemma game. Moreover, the elimination mechanism can make the network structure evolve into a high heterogeneity in degree distribution, which is considered to be helpful in promoting cooperation in evolutionary games. The present study may provide new insight for understanding the evolution of cooperation in light of the law â€˜survival of the fittestâ€™ in nature.}}

The Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS) recently has been developed and validated in dialysis patients. Study Design Observational cross-sectional study. Setting &amp; Participants 993 prevalent kidney transplant recipients. Predictor \{MIS\} computed from change in body weight, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity, comorbid conditions, decreased fat store/Systemic Global Assessment, signs of muscle wasting/Systemic Global Assessment, body mass index, serum albumin level, and serum transferrin level. Outcomes Markers of inflammation and malnutrition, including serum C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor Î±, serum leptin, prealbumin, body mass index, and abdominal circumference. The relationship was modeled by using structural equation models. Results Mean age was 51 Â± 13 years, 57% were men, and 21% had diabetes. Median time from transplant was 72 months. \{MIS\} significantly correlated with abdominal circumference (r = âˆ’0.144), serum C-reactive protein level (r = 0.094), serum interleukin 6 level (r = 0.231), and serum tumor necrosis factor Î± level (r = 0.102; P &lt; 0.01 for all). A structural equation model with 2 latent variables (malnutrition and inflammation factor) showed good fit to the observed data. Limitations Single-center study, lack of information about vascular access, presence of nonfunctioning kidney transplant, relatively high refusal rate. Conclusions Our results confirm that \{MIS\} reflects both energy-protein wasting and inflammation in kidney transplant recipients. This simple instrument appears to be a useful tool to assess the presence of protein-energy wasting in this patient population.}}

However, the relationship between p53 and Snail proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been completely understood. To determine whether Snail and p53 contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis, we analyzed the expression of Snail proteins in p53-overexpressing \{HCC\} cells. We found that p53 wild-type (WT) induced the degradation of Snail protein via murine double minute 2-mediated ubiquitination, whereas p53 mutant did not induce Snail degradation. As we expected, only p53WT induced endogenous Snail protein degradation and inhibited tumor cell invasion. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of p53 mutation and Snail overexpression as a late event in hepatocarcinogenesis.

Despite a wealth of biologic and clinical information on normal and pathologic airway structure and function, the primary causes and mechanisms of disease remain to a large extent unknown, preventing the development of more efficient diagnosis and treatment. We propose to overcome these limitations through an integrative systems biology research strategy designed to identify the functional and regulatory pathways that play central roles in respiratory pathophysiology, starting with severe asthma. This approach relies on global genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data sets collected in cross-sectional patient cohorts with high-throughput measurement platforms and integrated with biologic and clinical data to inform predictive multiscale models ranging from the molecular to the organ levels. Working hypotheses formulated on the mechanisms and pathways involved in various disease states are tested through perturbation experiments using model simulation combined with targeted and global technologies in cellular and animal models. The responses observed are compared with those predicted by the initial models, which are refined to account better for the results. Novel perturbation experiments are designed and tested both computationally and experimentally to arbitrate between competing hypotheses. The process is iterated until the derived knowledge allows a better classification and subphenotyping of severe asthma using complex biomarkers, which will facilitate the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions targeting multiple components of the molecular and cellular pathways involved. This can be tested and validated in prospective clinical trials.}}

abstract = {Cortical dynamics show self-sustained activity which is complex and non-periodic. Assemblies of neurons show transient coupling exhibiting both integration and segregation without entering a seizure state. Models to date have demonstrated these properties but have required external input to maintain activity. Here we propose a spiking network model that incorporates a novel combination of both local and long-range connectivity and dynamic synapses (which we call the \{LLDS\} network) and we present explorations of the network's micro and macro behaviour. At the micro level, the \{LLDS\} network exhibits self-sustained activity which is complex and non-periodic and shows transient coupling between assemblies in different network regions. At the macro level, the power spectrum of the derived EEG, calculated from the summed membrane potentials, shows a power-law-like distribution similar to that recorded from human EEG. We systematically explored parameter combinations to map the variety of behavioural regimes and found that network connectivity and synaptic mechanisms significantly impact the dynamics. The complex sustained behaviour occupies a transition region in parameter space between two types of non-complex activity state, a synchronised high firing rate regime, resembling seizure, for low connectivity, and repetitive activation of a single network assembly for high connectivity. Networks without synaptic dynamics show only transient complex behaviour. We conclude that local and long-range connectivity and short-term synaptic dynamics are together sufficient to support complex persistent activity. The ability to craft such persistent dynamics in a spiking network model creates new opportunities to study neural processing, learning, injury and disease in nervous systems.}}

The classical approach consists in assimilating the distribution law to standard models, for example Weibull or Rayleigh, and in determining the parameters of the model so that it gets closest to the discrete law obtained by statistically treating the wind speed measurements. The Weibull model is the most used one and provides good results. However, the accurate determination of the wind speed distribution law constitutes a major problem. Multi Layer Perceptron type artificial neural networks, highly effective in function approximation problems, are used here for the approximation of the wind speed distribution law. The site energy characteristics have been determined by means of the neural approach and compared with those obtained by the classical method. The results show that the distribution law achieved by the neural model provides assessments closer to the discrete distribution than the Weibull model. This approach has enabled the wind energy potential on the Dakar site to be determined in a more accurate way. The models are also used to assess the amount of energy the wind generator \{WES18\} of 80 kW power, set up at 10 m and 40 m above the ground, would produce annually.}}

Methods Sixty-six Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (T2DM) and 39 healthy control subjects were enrolled. We assessed clinical parameters, urinary albumin excretion rate (AER), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), intima media thickness (IMT) and serum levels of proinflammatory molecules. Results Serum levels of IL-6, IP-10 and MCP-1 were significantly higher in \{T2DM\} than in control subjects. In T2DM, serum levels of high-sensitivity (hs) CRP, IP-10, hsTNF-Î±, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were positively correlated with AER. Serum levels of IP-10, hsTNF-Î± and VCAM-1 were positively correlated with baPWV. Serum levels of hsCRP, IL-6, IP-10 and hsTNF-Î± were positively correlated with IMT. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that serum levels of hsTNF-Î± were independently associated with \{AER\} (Î² = 0.235, P = 0.038) and serum levels of IP-10 were independently associated with baPWV (Î² = 0.209, P = 0.047) and \{IMT\} (Î² = 0.303, P = 0.032).

Based on susceptible/infective/removed (SIR) models in homogeneous or heterogeneous networks, we find that these models evolve dynamically just like in networks without connectivity fluctuations if all the susceptible individuals are supposed to have the same effective contact. This means that effectively heterogeneous contacts play a striking role in epidemic dynamics. To go a step further, we introduce the effective contact function (ECF) into models and present an analytical and numerical study for the threshold and dynamical behaviors of epidemic incidence. The power-law and proportional \{ECFs\} are considered, and, we demonstrate analytically that the epidemic incidence is generally a monotone decreasing function of the epidemic threshold and increasing function of the number of effective contacts. Certain exceptional cases are also discussed. This tells us that we cannot always focus on the threshold to evaluate the extent of epidemic outbreaks.}}

Following replicator dynamics, an equation that can be used to solve for the steady state frequency of cooperation x âˆ— in a well-mixed population as a function of the parameters representing the cost-to-benefit ratio c / b , additional reward w / b , and N is derived. Cooperation is enhanced in general for w â‰  0 and a stable state with all cooperative agents (AllC state) emerges for small groups N and small c / b . In contrast, such a harmonious AllC state does not exist in the original \{NESG\} for c â‰  0 . The condition for the existence of an AllC state is estimated to be ( N âˆ’ 1 ) c &lt; w and good agreement is found when compared with numerical solutions. The observed disappearance of an AllC state and the drop in x âˆ— with N are discussed in terms of the change in the stability of the AllC state as N increases. Previous results in \{NESG\} are recovered as the w = 0 case of our model. Thus, the pleasure of enjoying the completed task earlier promotes cooperation and the effects are more pronounced when small-group collective interactions are considered.}}

abstract = {One of the most intriguing abilities of the gut is to function in isolation. This is possible because the gut's own nervous system, the enteric nervous system, contains the necessary elements to control reflex behaviors. Much progress has been made in identifying those neurons that encode mechanical or chemical stimuli. Thus, muscle behaviors in the small and large intestines depend on mechanosensitive neurons which encode a variety of mechanical stimuli, ranging from brief deformation of the neurons soma or processes to sustained tissue stretch. Mechanosensitivity has been recorded in a wide variety of neurons which behave like rapid or slowly adapting mechanosensors. Strikingly, mechanosensitive neurons do not appear to belong to a distinct class of highly specialised neurons but rather differ in their electrophysiology, neurochemistry and morphology. While some mechanosensitive neurons may respond to one stimulus type others appear to be polymodal. Available data would suggest that mechanosensitive enteric neurons are multitasking and hence belong to multifunctional circuits. This review summarises the main arguments in favour of this concept, discusses the stimulus modalities, the response patterns and the functional role of mechanosensitive enteric neurons and concludes with identifying future challenges.}}

By expressing balance equations in terms of partial mass flows instead of total mass flows and concentrations, and because the contaminant mass flow (ppm) is very small compared to the water mass flow (T.hâˆ’1), the problem becomes linear. The integer variables are related to the interconnections into the network. The biobjective optimization of the fresh water flow rate at the network entrance and the water flow rate at regeneration unit inlets, parameterized by the number of interconnections, is carried out according to a lexicographic procedure. A monocontaminant network involving ten processes and one regeneration unit illustrates the approach. Even if the results are specific, the methodology guide can be applied to a large panel of networks. On the one hand, this example shows that the Pareto front is a straight line where each point is a feasible solution, when the number of connections is maximal (120). On the other hand, the Pareto front is reduced with the number of connections (11) and constituted by isolated points located mainly on a straight line with the same slope as for 120 connections, but no feasible solution exists between these points.}}

On the basis of the fact that the dynamics on networks are intensively affected by the related topology, in this paper the dynamics of excitable systems on networks and a corresponding approach for detecting communities are discussed. Dynamical networks are formed by interacting neurons; each neuron is described using the \{FHN\} model. For noisy disturbance and appropriate coupling strength, neurons may oscillate coherently and their behavior is tightly related to the community structure. Synchronization between nodes is measured in terms of a correlation coefficient based on long time series. The correlation coefficient matrix can be used to project network topology onto a vector space. Then by the K -means cluster method, the communities can be detected. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is effective at discovering community structure in artificial networks and real networks, especially for directed networks. The results also provide us with a deep understanding of the relationship of function and structure for dynamical networks.}}

As an example we have studied the path-dependencies in closed trails in four metropolitan areas in England and the \{USA\} and computed their global and spatial correlations with measured traffic flows. We have found that the heterogeneous distribution of traffic intensity is mirrored by the distribution of agglomerate path-dependency and that high traffic roads are packed along corridors at short-to-medium trail lengths from the ensemble of nodes.}}

Thirty-two neural mass models (NMMs), each representing the lump activity of reasonably large groups of interacting excitatory and inhibitory neurons, were reciprocally and excitatory coupled using random rewiring as described by Watts and Strogatz. Numerical analysis of the network revealed an abrupt transition towards a synchronized state as a function of increasing coupling strength Î±. Synchronization increased with increasing degree and decreasing regularity of the network. Parameters of the functional network showed a diverse dependency on structural connectivity: normalized clustering coefficient Î³ and path length Î» increased with increasing Î±. For sufficiently large Î±, however, Î³ decreased with increasing rewiring probability p, while Î» increased. Hence, a structured functional network exists despite the randomness of the underlying structural network. That is, patterns of functional connectivity are influenced by patterns of the corresponding structural level but do not necessarily agree with those.}}

A distinct criterion for the flow regime transition is found based on the initial droplet volume and the Capillary (Ca) number.

This method is composed of the probability assessment of accidents, the analysis of consequences and the evaluation of risk. It is noteworthy that the consequences analyzed here include those of the outside and inside gas pipelines. The analysis of consequences of the outside pipelines focuses on the individual risk and societal risk caused by different accidents, while those of the inside pipelines concerns about the risk of the economic loss because of the pressure re-distribution. Risk of a sample urban gas pipeline network is analyzed to demonstrate the presented method. The results show that this presented integrated quantitative risk analysis method for natural gas pipeline network can be used in practical application.}}

abstract = {Transformity is one of the core concepts in Energy Systems Theory and it is fundamental to the calculation of emergy. Accurate evaluation of transformities and other emergy per unit values is essential for the broad acceptance, application and further development of emergy methods. Since the rules for the calculation of emergy are different from those for energy, particular calculation methods and models have been developed for use in the emergy analysis of networks, but double counting errors still occur because of errors in applying these rules when estimating the emergies of feedbacks and co-products. In this paper, configurations of network energy flows were classified into seven types based on commonly occurring combinations of feedbacks, splits, and co-products. A method of structuring the network equations for each type using the rules of emergy algebra, which we called â€œpreconditioningâ€� prior to calculating transformities, was developed to avoid double counting errors in determining the emergy basis for energy flows in the network. The results obtained from previous approaches, the Track Summing Method, the Minimum Eigenvalue Model and the Linear Optimization Model, were reviewed in detail by evaluating a hypothetical system, which included several types of interactions and two inputs. A Matrix Model was introduced to simplify the calculation of transformities and it was also tested using the same hypothetical system. In addition, the Matrix Model was applied to two real case studies, which previously had been analyzed using the existing method and models. Comparison of the three case studies showed that if the preconditioning step to structure the equations was missing, double counting would lead to large errors in the transformity estimates, up to 275 percent for complex flows with feedback and co-product interactions. After preconditioning, the same results were obtained from all methods and models. The Matrix Model reduces the complexity of the Track Summing Method for the analysis of complex systems, and offers a more direct and understandable link between the network diagram and the matrix algebra, compared with the Minimum Eigenvalue Model or the Linear Optimization Model.}}

They cover an area of 136 000 ha, which are mostly dominated by reservoirs, salt fields, shrimp ponds, tidal creeks, coastal brackish and marshes, shallow sea, as well as broad mudflat beaches. In recent years, population growth and economic development, rapid industrialization and urbanization, have result in severely wetland degradation and environment deterioration. A \{CEM\} has been developed for the \{CCW\} to understand the coastal wetland system and its response to natural and anthropogenic stressors. Drivers on the system are port construction, urbanization, industrial and agricultural practices, and water management. These drivers lead to five major ecosystem stressors: built-up area expansion, irrigation and drainage system, hunting and over-fishing, nitrogen and phosphorus input, and toxic pollutants input. Attributes that are affected by these stressors and can be used as indicators include fishes and aquatic fauna, wading birds, ecological and environmental events. As critical linkages between stressors and attributes, the ecological effects of the stressors are: reduced spatial extent, compartmentalization, altered hydrology, degraded water quality, and altered salinity regime.}}

Recent in vitro and clinical observations that wormwood can decrease TNF-Î± levels has led us to investigate the effect of wormwood as a supplement in patients with IgA nephropathy. Study Design Pilot uncontrolled trial. Setting &amp; Participants 10 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, normal kidney function, and a history of at least 3 months of proteinuria with protein excretion &gt;500 mg/d and &lt;3,500 mg/d despite ongoing dual renin-angiotensin system blockade. Intervention The selected patients were given supplements of 1.8 g/d of thujone-free wormwood preparation for 6 months without discontinuing their renin-angiotensin system blockade. Outcomes Proteinuria and blood pressure after intervention compared with baseline values. Measurements Monthly assessment of urine protein-creatinine ratio and blood pressure during the observation period. Results Urine protein-creatinine ratio decreased significantly from 2,340 Â± 530 to 315 Â± 200 mg/g at the end of the supplementation period (P &lt; 0.001) and was stable during the supplement-free follow-up of another 6 months. Estimated glomerular filtration rate and endogenous creatinine clearance were unchanged during the entire study period. There was a moderate, but significant, decrease (P &lt; 0.002) in mean arterial blood pressure. Limitations Open uncontrolled trial including a small number of patients. Conclusions Thujone-free wormwood with its favorable safety profile can be an alternative supplement to manage proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy.}}

abstract = {Logical models provide insight about key control elements of biological networks. Based solely on the logical structure, we can determine state transition diagrams that give the allowed possible transitions in a coarse grained phase space. Attracting pathways and stable nodes in the state transition diagram correspond to robust attractors that would be found in several different types of dynamical systems that have the same logical structure. Attracting nodes in the state transition diagram correspond to stable steady states. Furthermore, the sequence of logical states appearing in biological networks with robust attracting pathways would be expected to appear also in Boolean networks, asynchronous switching networks, and differential equations having the same underlying structure. This provides a basis for investigating naturally occurring and synthetic systems, both to predict the dynamics if the structure is known, and to determine the structure if the transitions are known.}}

In order to determine whether 5-HT also inhibits ghrelin's orexigenic and metabolic actions, the present study examined the effects of 5-HT pretreatment on ghrelin-induced alterations in eating and energy substrate utilization following direct injections into the hypothalamic PVN. Both 5-HT (5â€“20 nmol) and ghrelin (100 pmol) were administered at the onset of the dark cycle. Food intake was measured 2 h postinjection. A separate group of rats (n = 8) was injected with 5-HT paired with ghrelin and respiratory quotient (RQ; VCO2/VO2) was measured over 2 h using an open circuit calorimeter. \{PVN\} injections of ghrelin increased food intake and increased RQ, reflecting a shift in energy substrate utilization in favor of carbohydrate oxidation. 5-HT effectively blocked the effects of ghrelin on both food intake and RQ. We then administered the 5-HT2A/2C, receptor agonist, DOI, immediately prior to ghrelin. Similar to 5-HT, \{PVN\} \{DOI\} blocked ghrelin-induced eating and inhibited the peptide's effect on substrate utilization. These data are in agreement with other evidence suggesting that ghrelin functions as a gut-brain peptide in the control of food intake and energy metabolism, and indicate that 5-HT acts within the \{PVN\} to modulate ghrelin's orexigenic and metabolic signaling.}}

Materials and Methods \{USSC\} generation was initiated from fresh cord blood followed by lentiviral transfection and clone generation via limiting dilution. Individual clones were analyzed for lentiviral genomic integration patterns by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. In vitro differentiation of clonal \{USSC\} was performed into mesodermal, endodermal, and ectodermal lineages according to our published protocols. Respective osteogenic, hepatic, and neuronal lineage-specification was documented by immunohistochemistry and tissue-specific protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting. MicroRNA expression analysis was achieved using the TaqMan microRNA Megaplex array. Results Lentivirally labeled \{USSC\} cultures were successfully subjected to limiting dilution cloning. One clone containing a single lentiviral integration site was identified (clone 4) and used for further differentiation experiments. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction results from mesodermally, endodermally, and ectodermally differentiated \{USSC\} clone 4 consistently showed only the primary single lentiviral integration site. Lineage-specific differentiation experiments were confirmed by morphology and cell-fateâ€“specific monoclonal antibodies in immunocytochemistry. MicroRNA expression profiles did not reveal dramatic differences between clonal and nonclonal USSC. Conclusions The proof of the clonal existence of \{USSC\} is important for the assessment of biological properties unique for these unrestricted human stem cell candidates. As clones they can be subjected to advanced methods that enable defining of the multilayer nature of regulatory mechanisms through single-cell analysis.}}

Around the payoff parameter value r = 0.5 , we find a size-invariant symmetrical cooperation effect. While generally suppressing cooperation for r &gt; 0.5 payoffs, rewired networks facilitated cooperative behavior for r &lt; 0.5 . Fair amounts of noise were found to break the observed symmetry and further weaken cooperation at relatively large values of r. However, in the absence of noise, the self-questioning mechanism recovers symmetrical behavior and elevates altruism even under large-reward conditions. Our results suggest that an updating mechanism of this type is necessary to stabilize cooperation in a spatially structured environment which is otherwise detrimental to cooperative behavior, especially at high cost-to-benefit ratios. Additionally, we employ component and local stability analyses to better understand the nature of the manifested dynamics.}}

The survival pathways implicated in cellular response to drug treatment are primarily PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK, which also mediate the signalling activated by growth factors and play a role in the regulation of critical processes including cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Inhibitors of PI3K, Akt and mTOR have been shown to sensitize selected tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs through multiple downstream effects. Moreover, the \{MAPK\} pathway, also implicated in the regulation of gene expression in response to stress stimuli, can interfere with the chemotherapy-induced proapoptotic signals. Targeting Hsp90, which acts as a molecular chaperone for survival factors including Akt, may have the potential advantage to simultaneously block multiple oncogenic pathways. Overall, the available evidence supports the interest of rationally designed approaches to enhance the efficacy of conventional antitumor treatments through the inhibition of survival pathways and the notion that the concomitant targeting of multiple pathways may be a successful strategy to deal with tumor heterogeneity and to overcome drug resistance of tumor cells.}}

Interestingly, recent advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional neuroimaging data have catalyzed the exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions. These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.}}

Starting with no more than 30 scientists with an average of 1.5 collaborators in the year 1960 , the network to date consists of 7380 individuals that, on average, have 10.7 collaborators. We show that, in spite of the broad myriad of research fields covered, the networks form â€œsmall worldsâ€� and that indeed the average path between any pair of scientists scales logarithmically with size after the largest component becomes large enough. Moreover, we show that the network growth is governed by near-liner preferential attachment, giving rise to a log-normal distribution of collaborators per author, and that the average starting year is roughly inversely proportional to the number of collaborators eventually acquired. Understandably, not all that became active early have till now gathered many collaborators. We also give results for the clustering coefficient and the diameter of the network over time, and compare our conclusions with those reported previously.}}

The Al2O3:B samples were irradiated to different absorbed doses of 90Sr/90Y Î²-source and the continuous wave \{OSL\} (CW-OSL) was recorded on the samples using 470 nm blue light stimulation. These samples have shown a linear \{TL\} and CW-OSL response in the dose range of 20 mGy to 15 Gy. The minimum detectable dose, corresponding to 3Ïƒ limit of the variation of the output of the unirradiated dosimeters, was found to be 100 Î¼Gy. Irradiated samples stored in dark at room temperature for a period of two months show negligible fading. The \{TL\} and \{OSL\} sensitivities of the samples were found to be strongly dependent on process temperature and time. The \{TL\} response is marked by the absence of low temperature peak (&lt;100 Â°C), unlike the case of Î±-Al2O3:C, implying that the boron doping does not lead to formation of shallow traps. The Al2O3:B samples show faster photoionisation cross-section as compared to Î±-Al2O3:C. This approach of processing of single crystal Al2O3 in the boron ambience thus represents a potential way of introducing dosimetrically pertinent defects in Al2O3 single crystals.}}

Numerical simulations show that selective attention, especially individual relevance, cannot be ignored by launcher firms and information spreaders so as to attain the most successful promotion.}}

At molecular level, the expression of transcription factors, PPARÎ³ and C/EBPÎ±, was reduced by matrine during adipogenesis. After treatment for 6 days, the mRNA levels of adipocyte-specific genes, such as aP2, LPL, adiponectin and leptin, were also down-regulated by matrine in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, 500 Î¼g/ml matrine inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at the early stage of differentiation. Our results indicate that inhibition of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation by matrine is associated with the suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

As an application of \{BLS\} entropy, we considered the characterization of termite tunnel patterns because termite tunnel patterns can be broken down into a collection of simple units consisting of a single node and branches. These simple units correspond to UBNs. To this end, in additional to the entropy, we introduced the standard deviation (Ïƒ) of the difference in S between \{UBNs\} connected by a single tunnel branch. Forty simulated tunnel patterns were created for each of two termite species, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) and Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. These patterns were projected into &lt;S&gt;â€“Ïƒ phase space in order to assess their topological properties. This approach showed that for R. flavipes, their coordinates were relatively more clustered than those of C. formosanus. This result reflected that these two species were differently constrained by emergent property resulting from simple worker's tunneling behavior. We believe that the approach proposed in this study can be a useful tool to explore termite tunnel systems, but not limited to termite system.}}

Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis have been proposed as treatment because of their excellent safety profile. This review summarizes some data relating to the mechanisms of action of chondroitin sulfate in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritic joint tissues. Methods Peer-reviewed articles obtained using pre-defined search criteria and published in the PubMed database are summarized. In addition, a relevant in press paper is included. Results Chondroitin sulfate belongs to the group of glycosaminoglycans and is a major component of articular cartilage. The effect of chondroitin sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis is possibly the result of the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes by inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes and other factors that contribute to cartilage matrix damage and cause the death of these cells. Chondroitin sulfate was also shown to exert anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, it acts on osteoarthritic subchondral bone osteoblasts by modulating the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand ratio in favor of reduced bone resorption. It is noteworthy to mention that a head-to-head comparison of the effects of chondroitin sulfate of different origins and levels of purity on human osteoarthritic cartilage revealed the existence of a disparity in effects. Conclusion The positive effects of chondroitin sulfate on the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis are possibly due to its contribution to a proper balance between anabolism/catabolism in the articular tissues.}}

In this work we first propose and reformulate association rules analysis (ARA), a relatively new data mining algorithm with very limited scientific applications so far, in the form of an in-depth investigation method of the spatial pattern of landcover and vegetation maps. We applied \{ARA\} to two very different study areas in Northern Italy, the first (Ceno valley) having a substantial human footprint and mapped at 1:25,000 scale, the second (Foses valley) being almost natural and mapped at 1:5000 scale. We were able to: (a) detect the entire network of spatial adjacencies among landcover types and (b) quantify the frequency and strength of detected adjacencies. Based on our spatial analysis, we also advanced hypotheses on both natural and man-driven vegetation dynamics. In addition, \{ARA\} allowed us to propose an index of naturality based on the discovered contiguities. Results show the skill of the proposed approach to characterize landcover spatial patterns for both mid-resolution and high-resolution maps. Furthermore the proposed approach bears a general interest, since it can be applied to the analysis of any landcover map.}}

Abnormal fat accretion in the setting of obesity can lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and has been linked to some cancers and arteriosclerosis. Thus, a thorough appreciation of the intricate signaling events that must take place as quiescent adipocyte precursors are recruited into the proliferating cell population that then must â€˜decideâ€™ to differentiate into fully functional fat cells is critical to our understanding of diseases related to excess adipogenesis. We are beginning to gain insights into the molecular regulators of adipocyte differentiation. A significant advance would be to construct mathematical modeling tools that would assist cell biologists in predicting how environmental and/or intrinsic inputs could influence preadipocyte fate decision making. We have developed a model of how preadipocytes may use the dynamic interplay of two transcription factors, nuclear factor- Îº B ( \{NF\} â€� Îº B ) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- Î³ (PPAR- Î³ ) in early proliferation and differentiation events in vitro. Critical to the model is the feedback signaling between \{NF\} â€� Îº B and its inhibitor, I Îº B . The model is based on differential equations that describe the interactions of stimuli for \{NF\} â€� Îº B activation and mitogen concentrations and allows one to make predictions about how mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes choose between proliferation, differentiation or quiescence. Those predictions are supported by experiments on mouse 3T3-L1 cells.}}

Five \{SNP\} were identified through this strategy: c.*175C &gt; T at CSN1S1; c.*109T &gt; C, c.*139G &gt; C, and c.*160T &gt; C at CSN1S2; and c.*216C &gt; T at CSN2. Analysis with the Patrocles Finder tool predicted that all of these \{SNP\} are located within regions complementary to the seed of diverse miRNA sequences. These in silico results suggest that polymorphism at miRNA target sites might have some effect on casein expression. We explored this issue by genotyping the c.*175C &gt; T \{SNP\} (CSN1S1) in 85 Murciano-Granadina goats with records for milk \{CSN1S1\} concentrations. This substitution destroys a putative target site for miR-101, a miRNA known to be expressed in the bovine mammary gland. Although \{TT\} goats had higher levels (6.25 g/L) of \{CSN1S1\} than their \{CT\} (6.05 g/L) and \{CC\} (6.04 g/L) counterparts, these differences were not significant. Experimental confirmation of the miRNA target sites predicted in the current work and performance of additional association analyses in other goat populations will be an essential step to find out if polymorphic miRNA target sites constitute an important source of variation in casein expression.}}

A Lotkaâ€“Volterra system of equations for preyâ€“predator problems is considered, the competition factor being related to the difference in size between the agents in a one-on-one competition. This mechanism introduces a natural self-organized dynamic competition among agents. In the competition factor, a parameter Ïƒ is introduced for scaling the intensity of agent size similarity, which varies in each iteration cycle. The fixed points of this system are analytically found and their stability analyzed for small systems (with n = 5 agents). We have found that different scenarios are possible, from chaotic to non-chaotic motion with cluster formation as function of the Ïƒ parameter and depending on the initial conditions imposed to the system. The present contribution aim is to show how a realistic though minimalist nonlinear dynamics model can be used to describe the market competition (companies, brokers, decision makers) among other opinion maker communities.}}

Furthermore, the latter three metabolites may lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to redox cycling, which give rise to oxidative \{DNA\} lesions and altered signaling pathways. Also, the inhibition of \{DNA\} topoisomerase \{II\} may result in \{DNA\} double strand breaks. Even though the exact contribution of the respective metabolites to benzene-induced carcinogenicity is not yet resolved, the major \{DNA\} repair pathways such as base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER) and double strand break (DSB) repair are involved in the removal of benzene-induced \{DNA\} lesions. The observed target organ specificity may result from increased adduct formation, but also from poor repair in bone marrow progenitor cells.

Another scaling behavior is the power law relationship, C i âˆ¼ A i Î· , where Î· â‰ˆ 1.02 . This is known as the allometric scaling power law relationship because Ai can be treated as metabolism and Ci as the body mass of the sub-network rooted from the vertex i, according to the algorithm presented in this paper.

This magnetic communication would be the ground of short-term memory. In the present paper, we propose that brain magnetite may be a component of the mechanisms, conserved during evolution, to detect and transduce magnetic fields generated inside the cerebral neocortex. Specifically, we propose a possible role for magnetite nanoparticles, distributed through neuronal and astroglial membranes, in perception, transduction and storage of information that arrives to the neocortex.}}

Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is one of the optimal algorithms to estimate the network reliability for different kinds of network configuration. The traditional reliability estimation requires the information of all Minimal Paths (MPs) or Minimal Cuts (MCs). However, finding all MPs/MCs is extremely computationally expensive. This paper has compared and analyzed three Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) methods for estimating the two-terminal network reliability of a binary-state network: (1) \{MCS1\} simulates the network reliability in terms of known MPs, (2) \{MCS2\} estimates the network reliability in terms of known MCs; and (3) \{CAMCS\} (based on cellular automata, CA) estimates the network reliability directly without knowing any information of \{MPs\} or MCs. Our simulation results show that the direct estimation without knowing any information of \{MPs\} or \{MCs\} can speedup about 185 times when compared with other traditional approaches which require \{MPs\} or \{MCs\} information.}}

abstract = {This review focuses on gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours, excluding pancreatic endocrine tumours. Neuroendocrine tumours are rare ubiquitous neoplasms. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies have detected a significant increased in prevalence during the last 35 years. Most tumours have an indolent course and many patients have developed metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, a stage for which there is no available curative treatment. Novel diagnostic, prognostic and predictive markers are needed for the early detection and follow-up of disease progression; and identification of critical signalling pathways is needed to identify targets for effective treatment of these tumours. The complex nature of neuroendocrine cell function and the limited access to biopsy material has restricted elucidation of the tumour biology. The molecular pathology responsible for early tumourigenesis and metastatic processes are still largely unknown. However, it is currently the subject of major investigations and the field has progressed during recent years. This recent progress will be discussed in this review.}}

In addition, there is a caspase-independent pathway, which is mediated by the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Using caspase inhibitor gene therapy, we investigated the roles of caspases on the mitochondrial release of cyt c and the release of AIF. Specifically, we used herpes simplex virus-1 amplicon vectors to ectopically express a viral caspase inhibitor (crmA or p35) in mixed cortical cultures exposed to oxygen/glucose deprivation. Overexpression of either crmA or p35 (but not the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD) inhibited the release of AIF; this suggests that there can be cross-talk between the caspase-dependent and the ostensibly caspase-independent pathway. In addition, both crmA overexpression and \{DEVD\} inhibited cyt c release, suggesting a positive feedback loop involving activated caspases stimulating cyt c release.}}

This paper presents game theory methods to model the formation of binary opinions: cooperative games are proposed to model the interaction rules of general people who tend to find an agreement; minority games are proposed to model the behaviors of contrarians; opinion preference is considered by varying the payoff values. The Majority Voter model could be restored from the proposed games. The game theory models show evolutionary results similar to traditional opinion models. Specially, the evolution of opinions with consideration of contrarians is in accordance with the Galam model. Furthermore, influences of evolving rule, network topology and initial distribution of opinions are studied through numerical simulations. Discussions about methods to promote or hinder the consensus state at the best equilibrium point are given.}}

In this study, we identified serine 62 (Ser62) as a phosphorylation site in \{FLCN\} and generated an anti-phospho-Ser62-FLCN antibody. Our analysis suggests that Ser62 phosphorylation is indirectly up-regulated by \{AMPK\} and that another residue is directly phosphorylated by AMPK. By binding with FLCN-interacting proteins (FNIP1 and FNIP2/FNIPL), Ser62 phosphorylation is increased. A phospho-mimic mutation at Ser62 enhanced the formation of the FLCNâ€“AMPK complex.

This study investigates the differences between a \{GDM\} group and a control group. Study Design Using random sampling, 100 women who had had \{GDM\} were selected from a birth register. Glucose tolerance tests administered to these participants during pregnancy had yielded 1 or 2 abnormal values. The control group (n = 100) consisted of women who had normal glucose tolerance test during pregnancy. The informants were invited to a personal meeting, where their weight and height were measured and where they also answered the 15D questionnaire. Data were analysed with Ï‡2 â€“ test, Mannâ€“Whitney-test, independent samples t-test and regression analysis. Results The results for investigating the \{HRQoL\} indicated no significant differences on the 15D dimensions between the \{GDM\} group and the control group. The \{HRQoL\} for both groups was weakest on the dimensions of sleeping, discomfort and symptoms. Furthermore, the control group had a lower vitality score than the \{GDM\} group did. Analysis of the influence of background factors on \{HRQoL\} showed that women in a relationship experienced higher quality of life than single women. Conclusion This study showed no indication that women's lowered HRQoL, as measured by the 15D instrument, could be partly explained by GDM. Women's \{HRQoL\} was insignificantly decreased on the dimension of vitality only, so finding motivation for lifestyle changes and diabetes self-care may become challenging.}}

In this paper, we analyze the performance of Most Forward within Radius (MFR) routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks. We use an analytic model to evaluate the performance of \{MFR\} algorithm. The results show that, successful message delivery decreases with the increase in the number of links or with the increase in number of nodes in the network. Also successful message delivery increases as the lifetime of message delivery decreases.}}

Methods The patients underwent an otolaryngological examination and symptoms of rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, nasal itching and sneezing were evaluated for the diagnosis of AR. Tympanometry was performed by a middle ear analyzer (Impedance audiometer \{AZ\} 26, Interacoustics A/S, Assens, Denmark). Blood samples were collected for determination of peripheral blood eosinophil count (PBEC) and serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE). Allergen sensitivity was also determined by skin prick test. Results The study included 26 males (96.3%) and 1 female (3.7%) with a mean age of 12.1 Â± 4.4 years. Eight out of 27 subjects (29.6%) had blood eosinophilia and 11 out of 27 subjects had elevated serum IgE (40.7%). A positive skin prick test was identified for at least one allergen in 40% of patients (10/25 subjects). Symptoms and signs of \{AR\} were found in 10 subjects (37%). Median serum IgE level in subjects with \{AR\} (262.5 kU/L) was higher than without \{AR\} (40.2 kU/L) (p = 0.08), whereas there were no differences in \{PBEC\} or eosinophilia percentage (p &gt; 0.05). Mean middle ear pressures in the right and left ears were âˆ’66.4 daPa (range between âˆ’268 and 4 daPa) and âˆ’57.3 daPa (range between âˆ’308 and 0 daPa), respectively. The tympanometry results were abnormal in 5 subjects (18.5%) (3 type C and 2 type B tympanogram). Three out of 10 \{VKC\} patients with \{AR\} (30%) and 2 out of 17 \{VKC\} patients without \{AR\} (11.8%) had abnormal tympanograms (p = 0.33). Conclusion \{AR\} is commonly associated with \{VKC\} and subjects with \{AR\} are almost three times more likely to have \{ET\} dysfunction than those without. Therefore, opthalmologists should refer \{VKC\} patients to otolaryngologists to delineate associated \{AR\} and \{ET\} dysfunction. Conversely, patients with \{OME\} and/or \{AR\} who have persistent allergic eye symptoms may well benefit from opthalmologic evaluation for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and VKC.}}

The indentation test is chosen to illustrate the multiscale approach used in most modern studies of crystalline plasticity.

At the atomic scale, molecular dynamics simulations give access to the shape and position of the first dislocations induced by indentation. This information is then passed to a dislocation dynamics model that can simulate dislocation organization while the loading proceeds. At the continuum level, finite element simulations are conducted within the framework of crystal plasticity. The constitutive equations used in the continuum model are informed by dedicated dislocation dynamics simulations. Finite element simulations are quantitatively compared to experimental data demonstrating that the dislocation dynamics computations are pertinent.}}

In mammals the â€œshelterinâ€� complex mediates these central functions at telomeres. In the recent years it has become evident that also the heterochromatic structure of mammalian telomeres is implicated in telomere length regulation. Impaired telomeric chromatin compaction results in a loss of telomere length control. Progressive telomere shortening affects chromatin compaction at telomeric and subtelomeric repeats and activates alternative telomere maintenance mechanisms. Dynamics of chromatin structure of telomeres during early mammalian development and nuclear reprogramming further indicates a central role of telomeric heterochromatin in organismal development. In addition, the recent discovery that telomeres are transcribed, giving rise to UUAGGG-repeat containing TelRNAs/TERRA, opens a new level of chromatin regulation at telomeres. Understanding the links between the epigenetic status of telomeres, TERRA/TelRNA and telomere homeostasis will open new avenues for our understanding of organismal development, cancer and ageing.}}

Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses demonstrated a considerable reduction in the expression of major \{CNS\} myelin proteins both in the white and gray matter of mv rats, which was consistent with the morphological alterations of myelin sheaths. Real-time \{PCR\} analysis revealed a significant decrease in expression of proteolipid protein (PLP) mRNA both in the white and gray matter of mv rats. However, there was no significant difference between control and mv rats in the cell number of \{PLP\} mRNA-positive oligodendrocytes either in the white or gray matter, suggesting an impairment of myelin protein production by oligodendrocytes.

This basic mechanism likely relies on perceptual and motor information, and requires that both motor plans and the resulting activity be continuously mapped on a reliable body representation. It has been widely demonstrated that the parietal cortices of the two hemispheres play a crucial role, albeit differently specialized, in both monitoring internal representation of our own actions and sustaining body representation. Ample neuropsychological evidence indicates that while damage to the left parietal cortex affects the ability to generate and/or monitor an internal model of one's own movement, lesions of the right parietal lobe are largely responsible for severe perturbations of the internal representation of one's own body. In the present paper, we discuss the processes involved in body perception and self-recognition and propose a tentative model describing how the right and left parietal cortices contribute in integrating various sources of information to produce the unique, elementary experience of one's own body in motion. The ecological value of this process in constructing identity and autobiographical experience will be discussed.}}

To further explore this hypothesis, we determined the relationships among trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), microarchitecture, collagen cross-link content, and bone turnover in human vertebral trabecular bone. Trabecular bone specimens from \{L2\} vertebrae were collected from 51 recently deceased donors (54â€“95 years of age; 20 men and 30 women). Trabecular bone volume and microarchitecture was assessed by microCT and bone formation, reflected by osteoid surface (OS/BS, %), was measured by 2D histomorphometry. Pyridinoline (PYD), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), pentosidine (PEN) and collagen content in the cancellous bone were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Associations between variables were investigated by Pearson correlations and multiple regression models, which were constructed with BV/TV and collagen cross-links as explanatory variables and microarchitecture parameters as the dependent variables. Results: Microarchitecture parameters were modestly to strongly correlated with BV/TV (r2 = 0.10â€“0.71). The amount of mature enzymatic \{PYD\} and \{DPD\} cross-links were not associated with the microarchitecture, either before or after adjustment for BV/TV. However, there was a positive correlation between \{PEN\} content and trabecular number (r = 0.45, p = 0.001) and connectivity density (r = 0.40, p = 0.004), and a negative correlation between \{PEN\} content and trabecular separation (r = âˆ’0.29, p = 0.04). In the multiple regression models including BV/TV, age and \{PEN\} content was still significantly associated with several of the microarchitecture variables. In summary, this study suggests a link between trabecular microarchitecture and the collagen cross-link profile. As \{PEN\} reflects non-enzymatic glycation of collagen and generally increases with bone age, the association between \{PEN\} and trabecular architecture suggests that the preserved trabeculae may contain mainly old bone and have undergone little remodeling. Thus, vertebral fragility may not only be due to alterations in bone architecture but also to modification of collagen cross-link patterns thereby influencing bone's mechanical behavior.}}

We could previously show that expression of the rip4 gene is strongly downregulated in cutaneous wound repair, which might be initiated by a broad variety of growth factors and cytokines. Here, we demonstrate that in keratinocytes, rip4 expression is controlled by a multitude of different signal transduction pathways, such as the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) cascade, in a unique and specific manner. Furthermore, we show that the steroid dexamethasone abolishes the physiological rip4 downregulation after injury and might thus contribute to the phenotype of reduced and delayed wound reepithelialization seen in glucocorticoid-treated patients. As a whole, our data indicate that rip4 expression is regulated in a complex manner, which might have therapeutic implications}}

Favoring players with higher fitness, the latter is key for understanding the challenges faced by cooperators when competing with defectors. Evolutionary game theory provides a competent theoretical framework for addressing the subtleties of cooperation in such situations, which are known as social dilemmas. Recent advances point towards the fact that the evolution of strategies alone may be insufficient to fully exploit the benefits offered by cooperative behavior. Indeed, while spatial structure and heterogeneity, for example, have been recognized as potent promoters of cooperation, coevolutionary rules can extend the potentials of such entities further, and even more importantly, lead to the understanding of their emergence. The introduction of coevolutionary rules to evolutionary games implies, that besides the evolution of strategies, another property may simultaneously be subject to evolution as well. Coevolutionary rules may affect the interaction network, the reproduction capability of players, their reputation, mobility or age. Here we review recent works on evolutionary games incorporating coevolutionary rules, as well as give a didactic description of potential pitfalls and misconceptions associated with the subject. In addition, we briefly outline directions for future research that we feel are promising, thereby particularly focusing on dynamical effects of coevolutionary rules on the evolution of cooperation, which are still widely open to research and thus hold promise of exciting new discoveries.}}

However, the lack of theory in this field and the existence of conceptual and technological bottlenecks continue to hinder the advancement of \{PF\} modeling and prediction. This paper explores three theoretical perspectives on the relationships between pedogenesis and flow regimes in field soils. First, we examine non-equilibrium thermodynamics as applied to open dissipative field soils with continuous energy inputs and mass exchanges with the surrounding environment. The dual-partitioning of pedogenesis (dissipating and organizing processes) is consistent with the theory of dissipative structure, which explains the genesis and evolution of soil architecture (structure + matrix) and organized heterogeneity found in various soils. Such organized heterogeneity leads to widespread potential for \{PF\} occurrence. Second, we investigate constructal theory to explain the tendency for dual-flow regimes in soils â€“ one with high resistivity (Darcy flow) and the other with low resistivity (PF) â€“ together, they form \{PF\} configuration that provides the least global flow resistance. This theory is applied to explain some general characteristics of weathering processes and related flow regime changes, which are supported by limited chronologic data from the literature on subsoilâ€™s saturated hydraulic conductivity decrease after a soil reaches a certain age. Third, the theory of evolving networks sheds light on a variety of \{PF\} networks observed in field soils, which increase the effectiveness of energy and mass transfer in the subsurface. This is because networks are a part of the organization resulting from the minimum energy dissipation principle and far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. All the three theories discussed support the notion that the potential for \{PF\} occurrence in field soils is likely universal. However, controversies and challenges associated with these theories require further efforts to rigorously test their applicability in natural soils and to formulate explicit quantitative relationships between \{PF\} occurrence and its controls. The principle of soil formation and evolution provides a useful guide to this endeavor.}}

By separately estimating the effects of switching costs and complementarities, we demonstrate that measured complementarities are not solely due to switching costs.

On the other hand, organizations with greater network complexity are more likely to adopt both applications simultaneously than organizations with lower network complexity.}}

The presented methodology of the investigation involves systematic and exhaustive evaluation of the classifier performance over a neural network architecture space and with respect to training depth for a particular problem. In this study, the architecture space is defined over feed-forward, fully-connected artificial neural networks (ANNs) which have been widely used in computer-aided decision support systems in medical domain, and for which two popular neural network training methods are explored: conventional backpropagation (BP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Both training techniques are compared in terms of classification performance over three medical diagnosis problems (breast cancer, heart disease, and diabetes) from Proben1 benchmark dataset and computational and architectural analysis are performed for an extensive assessment. The results clearly demonstrate that it is not possible to compare and evaluate the performance of the two algorithms over a single network and with a fixed set of training parameters, as most of the earlier work in this field has been carried out, since training and test classification performances vary significantly and depend directly on the network architecture, the training depth and method used and the available dataset. We, therefore, show that an extensive evaluation method such as the one proposed in this paper is basically needed to obtain a reliable and detailed performance assessment, in that, we can conclude that the \{PSO\} algorithm has usually a better generalization ability across the architecture space whereas \{BP\} can occasionally provide better training and/or test classification performance for some network configurations. Furthermore, we can in general say that the PSO, as a global training algorithm, is capable of achieving minimum test classification errors regardless of the training depth, i.e. shallow or deep, and its average classification performance shows less variations with respect to network architecture. In terms of computational complexity, \{BP\} is in general superior to \{PSO\} for the entire architecture space used.}}

Some wastes are reused within the facility where they are generated, others are reused directly by nearby industrial facilities, and some are recycled via the formal and informal recycling markets. Direct inter-firm reuse is the cornerstone of the phenomenon termed industrial symbiosis, where firms cooperate in the exchange of material and energy resources. This study applies material flow analysis to an economically diverse industrial area in South India to characterize the recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals. It quantifies the generation of waste materials from 42 companies as well as the materials that are directly traded across facilities and those that are recycled or disposed. This study encompasses a business cluster in Mysore in the State of Karnataka, and is the first in India to thoroughly quantify material flows to identify existing symbiotic connections in an industrial area. Examined industries in this industrial area generate 897,210 metric tons of waste residuals annually, and recovered 99.5% of these, 81% with reused by the companies that generated them, with one company, a sugar refinery, processing most of this amount. Geographic data show that operations within 20 km of the industrial area receive over 90% of residuals exiting facility gates. Two-thirds of this amount goes directly to other economic actors for reuse. This study makes key contributions to the literature in distinguishing how particular types of materials are reused in different ways, the geographic extent of symbiotic activities and the important role of the informal sector in industrial waste management in industrializing regions.}}

Two particular concepts seem to be particularly relevant: scale-free patterns and small-worlds. By looking at 33 metro systems in the world, this paper adapts network science methodologies to the transportation literature, and offers one application to the robustness of metros; here, metro refers to urban rail transit with exclusive right-of-way, whether it is underground, at grade or elevated. We find that most metros are indeed scale-free (with scaling factors ranging from 2.10 to 5.52) and small-worlds; they show atypical behaviors, however, with increasing size. In particular, the presence of transfer-hubs (stations hosting more than three lines) results in relatively large scaling factors. The analysis provides insights/recommendations for increasing the robustness of metro networks. Smaller networks should focus on creating transfer stations, thus generating cycles to offer alternative routes. For larger networks, few stations seem to detain a certain monopole on transferring, it is therefore important to create additional transfers, possibly at the periphery of city centers; the Tokyo system seems to remarkably incorporate these properties.}}

The ecological, economic, and societal relations of the Mondego estuarine services were analysed. An inventory of the main ecosystem services provided by the Mondego system was performed. The conditions and trends of the main services (food production, recreation and water quality maintenance) were determined, and the scale dependence of this assessment was interpolated on three different scales: Mondego Basin, Lower Mondego, and Mondego Estuary. The interdependence among services was quantified; an ecological assessment regarding water quality and ecological conditions was performed, and a preliminary valuation of the food production, recreation and tourism in the region was undertaken. In the study system, from 1992 to 2006, there was an increase in recreation activities and water uses and a simultaneous decrease in services such as food production (i.e., strong interdependence among services). Ecological quality improvement is reflected in both local communitiesâ€™ diversity and water quality. The market prices method was used to estimate the values for the three services considered; however, the Mondego catchment's full value cannot be calculated without estimating the real wetlands value because these are prone to underestimation. Uncertainties and shortcomings regarding the reliability of this kind of assessment for implementation on estuarine ecosystems are discussed.}}

However, the rules governing composition, as is typical for all automata-based approaches, suffer from combinatorial state explosion, an effect that can have significant ramifications on the successful application of the Component Interaction Automata formalism to real-world scenarios. We must, therefore, find some appropriate means to counteract state explosion â€“ one of which is partition refinement through weak bisimulation. But, while this technique can yield the desired state space reduction, it does not consider synchronization cliques, i.e., groups of states that are interconnected solely by internal synchronization transitions. Synchronization cliques give rise to action prefixes that capture pre-conditions for a component's ability to interact with the environment. Current practice does not pay attention to these cliques, but ignoring them can result in a loss of valuable information. For this reason we show, in this paper, how synchronization cliques emerge and how we can capture their behavior in order to make state space reduction aware of the presence of synchronization cliques.}}

Using explicit finite volume schemes, we propose a definition of the discrete coupling term leading to schemes globally well-balanced (the global scheme preserves water at rest whatever if overflowing or not). For both equations (1D and 2D), we can consider independent finite volume schemes based on well-balanced Roe, HLL, Rusanov or other scheme, then the resulting global scheme remains well-balanced. We perform a few numerical tests showing on the one hand the well-balanced property of the resulting global numerical model, on the other hand the accuracy and robustness of our superposition approach. Therefore, the definition of the coupling term we present allows to superpose a local 2D model over a 1D main channel model, with non-flat topographies and mix incoming-outgoing lateral fluxes, using independent grids and finite volume solvers.}}

The problems are solved under a decentralized estimation-and-control framework. Using tools from algebraic graph theory and dynamical systems theory, it is shown that the two teams, involving a team of leaders and a team of followers, preserve some desired convergence properties, even if the geometric center of the leaders can only be obtained from estimators. A simulation example is presented to verify the validity of the derived results.}}

Although the reported functional differences are generally consistent, the structural differences are controversial among the various studies. In this study, we particularly focused on the gender-related effect in the gray matter (GM). We performed a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in 184 healthy adults (90 males and 94 females) with ages ranging from 18 to 70 years. Cortical thickness was measured using an automated surface-based method. Based on this surface morphological feature of GM, we first compared their regional differences between males and females. We then constructed the morphometry-based anatomical networks derived from cortical thickness measurement, while the anatomical connection between two cortical areas depended upon the statistical dependence of their cortical thickness across subjects. Subsequently, we applied graph theoretical approaches to investigate the properties of the resultant anatomical networks. The results showed that the significant gender-related differences of cortical thickness appeared extensively in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. And there were also some between-group differences in the interregional correlation. Additional graph theoretical analysis on the morphological networks revealed both networks exhibited the small-world efficiency and their patterns of topological vulnerability had no statistical differences. The findings on the large sample may provide the evidences to study the gender consistency and difference in the human brain structures.}}

The development process of neural networks for classification problems and the influence of network architecture on its prediction andÂ generalisation capabilities are analysed. The phenomenon of overfitting and its relationship to the number of network connections, and the size of the training data set are discussed. The new approach uses complex architecture networks and early stopping of training procedures to avoid overfitting. It is thus compared with previous studies and its results and advantages over them are assessed. Such comparison shows that this approach allows for the development of neural networks for the classification of industrial jobs according to their risk of causing \{LBDs\} in a way faster than previous procedures. The neural network obtained is able to correctly classify 81.6% of highly repetitive lifting industrial jobs as posing low or high-risk for LBDs, from five independent variables representing biomechanical risk factors. The neural network obtained has been implemented in a software application which focuses on risk analysis and prevention of the injuries caused by tasks involving manual lifting in the industrial environment. Relevance to industry The approach described in this paper allows neural networks to be developed for the prediction of musculoskeletal disorders in a way that is faster and easier than with previous procedures. It can also be applied to risk prediction in other areas of ergonomics. The neural network obtained can be used by the ergonomist as a diagnostic system, enabling jobs to be classified into two categories (low-risk and high-risk) according to the associated likelihood of causing low back disorders. This system provides a higher proportion of correct classifications than other previous models.}}

Standard optimization methods used in this field rely on simplified linear models that may fail in capturing the underlying complexity of the target metabolic network. Within this general context, we present a novel approach to globally optimize metabolic networks. The approach presented relies on (1) adopting a general modeling framework for metabolic networks: the Generalized Mass Action (GMA) representation; (2) posing the optimization task as a non-convex nonlinear programming (NLP) problem; and (3) devising an efficient solution method for globally optimizing the resulting \{NLP\} that embeds a \{GMA\} model of the metabolic network. The capabilities of our method are illustrated through two case studies: the anaerobic fermentation pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the citric acid production using Aspergillus niger. Numerical results show that the method presented provides near optimal solutions in low \{CPU\} times even in cases where the commercial global optimization package \{BARON\} fails to close the optimality gap.}}

In recent years a number of ligand-activated receptors have been found to exert a role in integrating essential steps of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile acid-activated receptors are a defined subset of nuclear and G-protein coupled receptors mainly expressed in entero-hepatic tissues for which bile acids function as signaling molecules. Primary bile acids (chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid) are physiological ligands/activators of farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR), pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), while litocholic acid is a ligand for the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the G-protein coupled receptor TGR5. Despite \{FXR\} demonstrates a high selectivity for bile acids, \{PXR\} and \{CAR\} are relatively promiscuous receptors integrating lipid homeostasis with xenobiotic metabolism. FXR, PXR, \{CAR\} and \{TGR\} exert synergistic activities in regulating lipid and glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure and liver and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Ligands for these receptors hold promise in the treatment of dyslipidemic conditions as revealed by results of a number of preclinical models but carry a defined risk for potential side effects.}}

In this paper, potential corridors were identified in Jinan City, China, using the least-cost path method, and green space networks were developed and improved based on graph theory and the gravity model. Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links. The potential networks revealed problems in the current greening plan. The green space network developed based on graph theory and the gravity model simplified and systematized the complex landscape, helping to identify the significance of each green space and guiding urban planning for biodiversity conservation.}}

Here, we estimate the contact network structure for an Atlanta, Georgia community with heterogeneous sexual and drug-related risk behaviors and build a detailed transmission model for \{HIV\} through this population. We show that accurate estimation of epidemic incidence requires careful measurement and inclusion of diverse factors including concurrency (having multiple partners), the duration of partnerships, serosorting (preference for partners with matching disease state), and heterogeneity in the number and kinds of partners. In the focal population, we find that injection drug users (IDUs) do not directly cause many secondary infections; yet they bridge the heterosexual and men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) populations and are thereby indirectly responsible for extensive transmission.}}

Three of these are design properties: near-steady-state or extremal dynamics, dominance of indirect effects, and positive utility in network organization. One is a regulatory property: distributed multivariable control. The methodology of the paper is mathematical modeling. The design properties are drawn from the inherent formalism in models. The control property is demonstrated by manipulating model parameters to achieve a management goal. The results show that: (1) natural ecosystems operate near, but not at, steady states or extrema, and ecosystems exploited for human purposes should be similarly maintained (near-steady-state imperative); (2) indirect effects are dominant in natural ecosystem networks, and should be taken into account in managing ecosystems for human benefits (nonlocal imperative); (3) natural ecosystems enhance positive relationships among their constituents, and ecosystems maintained for human services should be managed to maximize their expression of mutualistic and synergistic network properties (nonzero imperative); and (4) natural ecosystems are regulated by checks and balances distributed across many control variables in interactive networks, so that obtaining human services from ecosystems should similarly be through coordinated use of many, not few, control variables (multifactorial control imperative). The conclusion from these results is that ecosystems under natural conditions evidence organizational properties evolved over evolutionary time, and management for sustainable extraction of ecosystem services should seek to preserve and emulate these properties in the new exploited states.}}

We report that human \{HSCs\} exhibit delayed \{DNA\} double-strand break rejoining, persistent Î³H2AX foci, and enhanced p53- and ASPP1-dependent apoptosis after Î³-radiation compared to progenitors. p53 inactivation or Bcl-2 overexpression reduced radiation-induced apoptosis and preserved inÂ vivo repopulating \{HSC\} function. Despite similar protection from irradiation-induced apoptosis, only Bcl-2-overexpressing \{HSCs\} showed higher self-renewal capacity, establishing that intact p53 positively regulates self-renewal independently from apoptosis. The reduced self-renewal of \{HSCs\} with inactivated p53 was associated with increased spontaneous Î³H2AX foci in secondary transplants of HSCs. Our data reveal distinct physiological roles of p53 that together ensure optimal \{HSC\} function: apoptosis regulation and prevention of Î³H2AX foci accumulation upon \{HSC\} self-renewal.}}

A standard approach is using the correlation between the ratings that two users give to a set of objects, such as Cosine index and Pearson correlation coefficient. However, the costs of computing this kind of indices are relatively high, and thus it is impossible to be applied in the huge-size systems. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce six local-structure-based similarity indices and compare their performances with the above two benchmark indices. Experimental results on two data sets demonstrate that the structure-based similarity indices overall outperform the Pearson correlation coefficient. When the data is dense, the structure-based indices can perform competitively good as Cosine index, while with lower computational complexity. Furthermore, when the data is sparse, the structure-based indices give even better results than Cosine index.}}

abstract = {The traditional view on cerebellar functioning has recently been challenged by results from neuroanatomical, neuroimaging and clinical studies. In this contribution, eighteen patients with primary cerebellar lesions (vascular: n = 13; neoplastic: n = 5) were systematically investigated by means of an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Fifteen patients (83%) presented with a broad variety of cognitive and linguistic deficits following cerebellar damage. Disturbances of attention (72%), executive functioning (50%) and memory (50%) were most commonly found. Analyses of our results tend to support the hypothesis of a lateralization of cognitive modulation within the cerebellum, the right cerebellar hemisphere being associated with logical reasoning and language processing and the left cerebellum mediating right-hemispheric functions including attentional and visuo-spatial skills. In addition, nine patients (50%) presented with frontal-like behavioural and affective alterations. In an attempt to determine the working-mechanism underlying cerebellar-induced cognitive and affective disturbances, all patients were investigated by means of quantified Tc-99m-ethylenecysteine dimer (ECD) single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) studies. From a semiological point of view, damage to the cerebellum can cause a broad spectrum of clinically significant cognitive and affective disturbances. From a pathophysiological point of view, quantified \{SPECT\} data, reflecting the phenomenon of cerebello-cerebral diaschisis, support the functional impact of the cerebellar lesion on cortical functioning through disruption of cerebello-cerebral connections.}}

Terms are extracted from the graph representation of document by employing weighted feature extraction method. 2-D wavelet transform is used to compress the graph due to its sparseness while preserving the basic document structure. After transform, low-pass subbands are stacked to represent the term associations in a document. We then develop a new dual wing harmonium model projecting these multiple features into low dimensional latent topics with different probability distributions assumption. Contrastive divergence algorithm is used for efficient learning and inference. We perform extensive experimental verification in document classification and retrieval, and comparative results suggest that the proposed method delivers better performance than other methods.}}

abstract = {Analysis of complex time-dependent biological networks is an important challenge in the current postgenomic era. We propose a middle-out approach for decomposition and analysis of complex time-dependent biological networks based on: 1), creation of a detailed mechanism-driven mathematical model of the network; 2), network response decomposition into several physiologically relevant subtasks; and 3), subsequent decomposition of the model, with the help of task-oriented necessity and sensitivity analysis into several modules that each control a single specific subtask, which is followed by further simplification employing temporal hierarchy reduction. The technique is tested and illustrated by studying blood coagulation. Five subtasks (threshold, triggering, control by blood flow velocity, spatial propagation, and localization), together with responsible modules, can be identified for the coagulation network. We show that the task of coagulation triggering is completely regulated by a two-step pathway containing a single positive feedback of factor V activation by thrombin. These theoretical predictions are experimentally confirmed by studies of fibrin generation in normal, factor V-, and factor VIII-deficient plasmas. The function of the factor V-dependent feedback is to minimize temporal and parametrical intervals of fibrin clot instability. We speculate that this pathway serves to lessen possibility of fibrin clot disruption by flow and subsequent thromboembolism.}}

We focus our study on the number of packets in transit (NPT) that is an aggregate measure of a network quality of service (QoS) performance. The \{NPT\} network performance indicator measures directly the number of packets in the network on their routes to their destinations. We carry out our study using a time-discrete simulation model that is an abstraction of the Network Layer of the \{ISO\} \{OSI\} Reference Model. This model focuses on packets and their routing. We consider a static routing and two different types of dynamic routings and different volumes of incoming traffic in the network free flow state. Our study shows that the efficiency of performance of a routing measured as an average value of the \{NPT\} time series and as a variability of this series, changes with the volume of incoming traffic among the considered routings. Thus, depending on the volume of incoming traffic it is preferable to use one type of routing over the other ones if the objective is to maintain the lowest number of packets in transit and their variability, i.e. the highest QoS network performance.}}

abstract = {With the rapid evolution of some application technologies in two-tiered wireless sensor network (WSNs), more and more new communication services are emerging quickly, such as multicast video conferencing, retrieval systems and video-on demand, which need the multimedia communication services in multicast mode. Multicast routing is thereby an effective way to communicate among multiple cluster head nodes (CNs) in the network. However, severe energy constraints, Limited link and path constraints make the multicast routing protocol design particularly challenging in WSNs. A fundamental challenge in \{WSNs\} is how to maximize network lifetime with regard to a given multicast mission and a certain amount of initial energy provisioning. In this paper, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) based on extended sequence and topology encoding (GAEST) for the multicast protocol in two-tiered WSN. We design power and energy model for \{GAEST\} to reasonably adjust CNâ€™s Euclid distance according to transmission power calculated by fitness function. To take residual battery energy of \{CNs\} and energy balance between \{CNs\} into consideration, extended sequence and topology encoding not only holds the T chromosomes which represents the gene topology and records position index of CNâ€™s father node, but adds a crucial information for each gene in S chromosomes: the number of CNâ€™s children. S-chromosomes crossover of \{GAEST\} can change the multicast tree structure drastically and give genetic algorithm the ability of global search to leap from a point in the solution space to a far away point. \{GAEST\} improves the mutation process according to Mutation-Replace model, which reasonably swaps the leaf node holding maximum residual energy node with the non-leaf one with the minimum. Simulation results show that \{GAEST\} prolongs the lifetime of multicast service compared with Directed Diffused protocol, and increases the packet delivery ratio and fitness value in comparison with GAP, and still obtains the optimal convergence speed from different crossover or mutation probabilities.}}

abstract = {Biliary obstruction results in a well-characterized cholestatic inflammatory and fibrogenic process; however, the mechanisms and potential for liver repair remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that Kupffer cell depletion reduces polymorphonuclear cell (neutrophil) (PMN) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)8 levels in repairing liver. We therefore hypothesized that PMN-dependent \{MMP\} activity is essential for successful repair. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received reversible biliary obstruction for 7 days, and the rat PMN-specific antibody \{RP3\} was administered 2 days before biliary decompression (repair) and continued daily until necropsy, when liver underwent morphometric analysis, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR, and in situ zymography. We found that \{RP3\} treatment did not reduce Kupffer cell or monocyte number but significantly reduced \{PMN\} number at the time of decompression and 2 days after repair. \{RP3\} treatment also blocked resorption of type I collagen. In addition, biliary obstruction resulted in increased expression of MMP3, MMP8, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. Two days after biliary decompression, both \{MMP3\} and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 expression declined toward sham levels, whereas \{MMP8\} expression remained elevated and was identified in bile duct epithelial cells by immunohistochemistry. \{PMN\} depletion did not alter the hepatic expression of these genes. Conversely, collagen-based in situ zymography demonstrated markedly diminished collagenase activity following \{PMN\} depletion. We conclude that \{PMNs\} are essential for collagenase activity and collagen resorption during liver repair, and speculate that PMN-derived \{MMP8\} or PMN-mediated activation of intrinsic hepatic \{MMPs\} are responsible for successful liver repair.}}

This classic model provides a solid framework to study flower development and has been the foundation for multiple studies in different plant species, as well as for new evolutionary hypotheses. Nevertheless, it has been shown that in spite of being necessary, these three gene classes are not sufficient for flower organ specification. Rather, flower organ specification depends on complex interactions of several genes, and probably other non-genetic factors. Being useful to study systems of complex interactions, mathematical and computational models have enlightened the origin of the A, B and C stereotyped and robust expression patterns and the process of early flower morphogenesis. Here, we present a brief introduction to basic modeling concepts and techniques and review the results that these models have rendered for the particular case of the Arabidopsis thaliana flower organ specification. One of the main results is the uncovering of a robust functional module that is sufficient to recover the gene configurations characterizing flower organ primordia. Another key result is that the temporal sequence with which such gene configurations are attained may be recovered only by modeling the aforementioned functional module as a noisy or stochastic system. Finally, modeling approaches enable testable predictions regarding the role of non-genetic factors (noise, mechano-elastic forces, etc.) in development. These predictions, along with some perspectives for future work, are also reviewed and discussed.}}

The networks exhibit collective oscillations in the form of synchronized bursting rhythms, without affecting the fast timescale dynamics. We investigate the suppression of these synchronized oscillations using a feedback control in the form of a time-delayed signal. We located domains of bursting synchronization suppression in terms of perturbation strength and time delay, and present computational evidence that synchronization suppression is easier in scale-free networks than in the more commonly studied global (mean-field) networks.}}

However, the demands on these models are shifting to complex biological issues such as functional diversity, and changes in ecosystems and their services such as exploited fish stocks and carbon sequestration. Current ecosystem models generally use a food web structure reduced to its bare essentials. A consequence of the simplified structure is that they are specialized to a particular time, place and ecosystem state and thereby have limited ability to evolve into a substantially different state as a result of internal dynamics or changes in external forcing. We use food web theory and the ideas from complexity theory to argue that an improved representation of the structure of marine food webs is essential for the next generation of marine ecosystem models. Here we propose that a useful guiding principle for model design is provided by earth system models of intermediate complexity; a willingness to sacrifice process detail in order to increase the number of interacting components in the system and simulate the web of feedback loops.}}

abstract = {There are fundamental differences between citation networks and other classes of graphs. In particular, given that citation networks are directed and acyclic, methods developed primarily for use with undirected social network data may face obstacles. This is particularly true for the dynamic development of community structure in citation networks. Namely, it is neither clear when it is appropriate to employ existing community detection approaches nor is it clear how to choose among existing approaches. Using simulated citation data, we highlight the tradeoff inherent in algorithm selection thereby clarifying the conditions under which one should use existing methods. We hope this paper will serve as encouragement for those interested in the development of more targeted approaches for use with longitudinal citation data.}}

Particularly the challenges in designing transport policies on a rapidly evolving technological frontier are emphasised. The theoretical background of the paper stems from policy assessment as well as futures studies, especially from technology roadmapping. The paper presents a socio-technical roadmapping method as a tool to integrate the technology developments better with societal developments and transport policy design. The method is tested with a Finnish case study, which provides three thematic, complementary roadmaps of the potential transport system technology services of the future. The roadmaps illustrate what kind of technologies, services, actors and related policy relevant knowledge is needed in satisfying the demands of transport policy development in the future's ubiquitous society. The case study reveals several changes in the transport system: pluralised number of actor roles and actor networks in the system, emergence of a new kind of business and service layer because of the new dynamic inter-linkages between the actors, and further, possibility to capture the service layer with the concept of â€œtechnology serviceâ€�. The changes require also re-conceptualisation of knowledge production to support transport policies. In conclusion, the socio-technical roadmapping holds great potentials as a tool for aligning technology development with transport policy development.}}

Our study adds new evidence to the limited literature on this topic with an empirical investigation for the patent collaboration networks of 16 main innovative countries during 1975â€“2006. We combine small world network theory with statistical models to systematically explore the relationship between network structure and patent productivity. Results fail to support that the size of largest component enhances innovative productivity significantly, which is not consistent with recent concerns regarding positive effects of largest component on patent output. We do find that small-world structure benefits innovation but it is limited to a special range after which the effects inversed and shorter path length always correlates with increased innovation output. Our findings extend the current literature and they can be implicated for policy makers and relevant managers when making decisions for technology, industry and firm location.}}

Ir/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 favour the hydrogenation reaction to butane-1,4-diol, whereas Rh/SiO2, Pd/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 significantly promote double bond and geometric isomerization processes, leading to 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran and trans-2-butene-1,4-diol, respectively.

In order to verify how the lack of Gsdma3 affects the hair defects, we use alopecia and excoriation mice, a new mouse mutation in this gene, as our research model. This mutation exhibits progressive hair loss, from head to the whole back, and followed by hair regrowth. We test that Gsdma3 is expressed in matrix, inner root sheath, and hair shaft. Ultrastructural and histological analyses show abnormal hair structures and reduced hair keratins in \{AE\} mice. The loss of interlocking structures and abnormal constitutive protein indicate defects in anchoring hair shaft in the hair follicle and resisting external forces. Molecular analysis of Gsdma3 deficiency and overexpression shows an Msx2/Foxn1/acidic hair keratin genetic pathway is involved. Thus, Gsdma3 is necessary for normal hair follicle differentiation.}}

Total \{PA\} was calculated using metabolic equivalents for \{PA\} intensity. Serum leptin was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After adjustment for age, area of residence, smoking, body mass index, and waist circumference, total \{PA\} (r = âˆ’0.129, P = .038 in men and r = âˆ’0.226, P = .006 in women), the duration of vigorous-intensity activity (r = âˆ’0.120, P = .044 in men and r = âˆ’0.154, P = .019 in women), the duration of moderate-intensity activity (r = âˆ’0.114, P = .047 in men and r = âˆ’0.160, P = .018 in women), and time spent on sedentary behaviors (r = 0.194, P = .014 in men and r = âˆ’0.204, P = .007 in women) were significantly correlated with serum leptin. In both sexes, participants in higher categories of \{PA\} had significantly lower serum leptin levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an inverse association between leptin concentrations and \{PA\} independent of age, sex, smoking, and body adiposity. Our results point to the regulatory effects of \{PA\} on serum leptin.}}

We intended to investigate the expression of ghrelin and its receptor GHSR-1a in different myocardial areas of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) as compared to heart-healthy subjects to better define the role of the ghrelin signaling system in the networks regulating cardiac function and its potential as a target for diagnosis and/or treatment of CHF. Myocardium biopsies of 12 patients undergoing heart transplantation and suffering from \{CHF\} were obtained. Expression of both ghrelin and GHSR-1a was assessed by means of immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Expression of ghrelin was significantly decreased in \{CHF\} hearts both in atrium and ventricles in comparison to the control hearts (p &lt; 0.05). The expression of the GHS-1a receptor was significantly increased in the \{CHF\} biopsies as compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were found between the anatomical areas studied. Expression of myocardial ghrelin and GHSR-1a is directly associated with myocardial function: \{CHF\} hearts exhibit an impaired ghrelin production which might reflect maladaptive processes and an â€“ probably compensatory â€“ increase in GHSR-1a expression. These findings may open up new perspectives regarding the potential of ghrelin signaling as a target for pharmacological modulation.}}

The most common approach involves measurement of centrality of species or other groups of individuals based on their topological positions in food webs, followed by establishing the rank order of importance of these groups. However, ranking may differ considerably with indices of centrality and therefore comparison of rank orders is essential to obtain more meaningful results on species performance. Since ranking ignores absolute differences between centrality values, species orders may neglect important structural information in food webs. Consequently, simultaneous examination of the distribution of index values is inevitable. Hierarchical clustering and consensus generation revealed that rank orders of centrality exhibit a similar pattern over six example food webs, while distributions differ not only with indices because their relationships are largely inconsistent with food webs as well. Therefore, optimal analysis of networks and the selection of keystone species in any ecological study should rely upon both of these procedures. Similar conclusions are drawn from the detailed evaluation of a sample food web from the Florida Bay.}}

The dc and ac conductivities values increase, whereas the activation energy of conductivities decreases with increasing Nd2O3 content in the glasses containing LiF and by the replacement of LiF by Li2O the conductivity was found to decrease with addition of Nd2O3. The electrical conduction has been observed to be due to small polaron hopping at high temperatures. The frequency dependence of the ac conductivity follows the power law ÏƒAC (Ï‰)Â =Â A Ï‰s. The frequency exponent (s) values (in the range 0.94 and 0.33) decreases with increasing temperature. The dielectric constant and dielectric loss increased with increasing temperature and decreased with increase in frequency for all glasses studied. In LiF glasses, it is observed that, the values of É›\ and tanÂ Î´ are observed to increase with the addition of Nd2O3 whereas they decrease in the glasses containing Li2O. The electrical modulus formalism has been used for studying electrical relaxation behavior in studied glasses. It is for first time that the Nd2O3 doped barium tellurite borate glasses have been investigated for dc and ac conductivities and dielectric properties over a wide range of frequency and temperature.}}

Too often, the metabolic engineering of plant carotenogenesis has been obstructed by our limited knowledge on how the endogenous pathway interacts with other related metabolic pathways, particularly with those involved in the production of isoprenoid precursors. However, recent discoveries are providing new insights into this field. All isoprenoids derive from prenyl diphosphate precursors. In the case of carotenoids, these precursors are produced predominantly by the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in plants. This review focuses on the progress in our understanding of how manipulation of the \{MEP\} pathway impacts carotenoid biosynthesis and on the discoveries underlining the central importance of coordinating the supply of MEP-derived precursors with the biosynthesis of carotenoids and other derived isoprenoids.}}

Endothelial dysfunction is an important antecedent of many complications of diabetes; it has been noted in states of pre-diabetes and even in first-degree relatives.

Linkage analysis indicated significant \{QTL\} for \{BWT\} on sheep chromosomes 1, 3, and 6 (chromosome-wide significance of P &lt; 0.01). No \{QTL\} was detected on OAR11, and OAR14. \{QTL\} effect ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 in unit of residual standard deviation in different families.

The concentrations of total analyzed \{PCBs\} were in the range 256â€“2140 pg gâˆ’1 on dry weight basis in surface soils. There was a higher accumulation of \{PCBs\} in farms irrigated by wastewater, with decachlorobiphenyl (CB-209) as the predominant congener. The spatial distributions of \{PBDEs\} were similar although not as obvious as that of PCBs, and BDE-209 was the predominant congener at 2040â€“496 000 pg gâˆ’1 dw, accounting for &gt;96% of the total analyzed PBDEs. However, no significant correlations could be found between \{PCB\} and \{PBDE\} concentrations in the topsoil samples, and also with soil organic content between the different sites. On the other hand, soil vertical profiles showed significant relationship with soil organic content in cores taken from farms irrigated with wastewater. The vertical distribution was quite uniform at the topsoil, corresponding to the plowed layer, and decreased thereafter exponentially. Furthermore, the soil vertical distribution was found to be congener specific for PCBs, where less chlorinated congeners were able to penetrate deeper into the soil while heavier congeners were more restricted in their movement. This fractionation process was however not found for PBDEs. Also, the prevalence and high relative concentrations of CB-11 and CB-209 suggests that these \{PCB\} congeners should more often be included in routine environmental analysis in order to identifying unusual contamination sources.}}

Results E. coli 536 mutants in which \{PAIs\} \{II\} or \{III\} were deleted showed a significant decrease in virulence compared to the wild type (WT). All other single-PAI deletion mutants were as lethal to mice as was the WT. The mutant in which all seven \{PAIs\} were deleted showed milder virulence than the mutants in which \{PAI\} \{III\} or \{PAIs\} \{III\} and \{IV\} were deleted. The mutant in which \{PAIs\} II, III, IV, V, and \{VII\} were deleted tended to be less virulent than the mutant with deletion of \{PAI\} \{III\} only. All together, these results indicate a rough additive effect of \{PAIs\} in extra-intestinal virulence. Conclusion All \{PAIs\} of E. coli 536 do not play the same role in extra-intestinal virulence estimated in a mouse septicemia model and \{PAIs\} cooperate in an additive manner to achieve extra-intestinal virulence.}}

Since the native nature of \{PDMS\} is hydrophobic it requires a functionalization step for use in conjunction with aqueous media. Commonly, oxygen plasma treatment is used for the formation of hydrophilic groups on the surface. However, the hydrophilic nature of these surfaces is short lived and the surfaces quickly revert back to their original hydrophobic state. In this work, branched-polyethylenimine (b-PEI) was used for long term modification of plasma treated \{PDMS\} surface. Contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used for characterization of the modified surfaces and their stability with time was studied. The results obtained demonstrate that comparatively higher stability, hydrophilic, positively charged surfaces can be obtained after b-PEI treatment. These b-PEI treated \{PDMS\} surfaces can be used as fluidic channels for the separation of molecules as well as a substrate for the adherence of bio-molecules or biological cells.}}

These pleiotropic effects stem not only from the ability of \{RXRs\} to dimerize with diverse nuclear receptors, which exert transcriptional control on specific aspects of cell biology, but also because binding of \{RXR\} ligands to heterodimers can stimulate transcriptional activation by \{RXR\} partner receptors. This signaling network is rendered more complex by the existence of different \{RXR\} isotypes (RXRÎ±, RXRÎ², RXRÎ³) with distinct properties that thereby modulate the transcriptional activity of RXR-containing heterodimers. This review discusses the emerging roles of \{RXR\} isotypes in the \{RXR\} signaling network and possible implications for our understanding of nuclear receptor biology and pharmacology.}}

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the role of \{P1\} and \{P2\} purine receptors in modulating ePPi production by articular chondrocytes. Methods Porcine cartilage explants and chondrocyte monolayers were cultured in the presence of \{P1\} agonists, or a \{P2\} agonist or antagonist and inhibitors of \{P2\} signaling. Ambient media ePPi concentrations were measured after 48â€“96 h. Results The \{P1\} agonists \{NECA\} and \{CGS\} 21680 significantly decreased ePPi concentrations surrounding chondrocytes and cartilage explants. The \{P2\} agonist, ADP, increased ePPi levels, and the \{P2\} antagonist, suramin, decreased ePPi concentrations. Thapsigargin and 1,2 bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ€²Nâ€²-tetra acetic acid (BAPTA), which dampen Ca2+-related \{P2\} signaling, suppressed the response to ADP. Conclusions Purine receptors are important regulators of ePPi production by chondrocytes. \{P1\} receptor stimulation diminishes and \{P2\} receptor stimulation enhances ePPi production. Alterations in receptor signaling or aberrations of extracellular purine nucleotide metabolism resulting in abnormal quantities or proportions of \{P1\} and \{P2\} receptor ligands could foster changes in ePPi production that in turn affect mineralization. We propose a homeostatic role for extracellular purine nucleotides and purine receptors in stabilizing ePPi concentrations.}}

They were characterized by a combination of analytical, spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. According to the thermal analysis results all the compounds present coordinated and lattice water molecules in the structures. In compounds MnBTBPP and CoBTBPP, the metal centers exhibit octahedral geometry while in compound CuBTBPP, the Cu+2 ions adopt square-planar and square-pyramidal geometries. In all cases, both \{BPP\} and \{BT\} ligands are coordinated to the metal sites in the bridging mode extending the polymeric networks. The \{BT\} ligand carboxylate groups act in a monodentate coordination mode as indicated by the Raman spectra data through the Î”Î½ [Î½asym(COO) âˆ’ Î½sym(COO)] value.}}

CS/MC hydrogels were prepared via blending of CS, \{MC\} and salts under mild conditions without organic solvent, high temperature or harsh pH. Such blends were liquid at low temperature (âˆ¼4 Â°C), but gel under physiological conditions (37 Â°C). The effect of different salts including NaCl, Na3PO4, NaHCO3 and glycerophosphate (GP) on the CS/MC gelation process was investigated by rheological analysis from which possible gelation mechanisms were inferred. Viscoelastic characteristics indicated that CS/MC gels formed using different salts had different gelation temperature, gelation rate, and gel strength. Gelation temperature followed the order NaCl &gt; \{GP\} &gt; Na3PO4 &gt; NaHCO3, gelation rate followed the order \{GP\} &gt; NaHCO3 &gt; Na3PO4, and gel strength followed the order \{GP\} &gt; NaHCO3 &gt; Na3PO4 (at 37 Â°C). CS/MC hydrogels were also characterised by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). CS/MS gels formed with different salts had different gel structures, ranging from nonporous to microporous. When used as a scaffold for chondrocytes, CS/MC/Na3PO4 hydrogel resulted in good cell viability and proliferation.}}

Such structures have been realised by blocking individual holes on one end of a PCF, leaving the desired infiltration pattern unblocked. Unblocked holes are then infiltrated by immersing the unblocked end of the fibre in a reservoir of the infiltrating liquid, allowing for the realisation of a wide variety of periodic structures. Such structures are studied for traditional linear and nonlinear effects in periodic systems.}}

A theoretical model, considering the head loss along the entire \{EO\} micropump system and the finite electrical double layer (EDL) effect on the flow rate, is developed for the first time to analyze the performance of the \{EO\} micropump. The theoretical and experimental results are in good agreement. It is revealed that the major head loss could remarkably decrease the flow rate, which thus should be taken into account for the applications of the \{EO\} micropump in various Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices. However, the effect of the minor head loss on the flow rate is negligible. The resulting flow rate increases with increasing porosity of the porous membrane and Îºa, the ratio of the radius of the nanopore to the Debye length.}}

To investigate, we measured levels of the stress hormone cortisol, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the systemic inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as depression and neuroticism, in clinically anxious and non-anxious adults. Compared with non-anxious participants, clinically anxious participants exhibited significantly lower levels of morning cortisol and significantly higher levels of IL-6, independent of age, sex, and depressive symptoms. These group differences were robust when controlling for neuroticism. Conversely, the groups had equivalent levels of \{CRP\} in all analyses. Results are indicative of anxiety-specific effects on inflammatory activity, and highlight a pathway by which anxiety may increase risk for inflammatory diseases.}}

Afterward, the women with endometriosis were divided into two groups according to the stage: group 1 included 63 women in stages Iâ€“II, and group 2 included 72 women in stages IIIâ€“IV. Intervention(s) Genotyping by polymerase chain reactionâ€“based restriction fragment-length polymorphism method.

To investigate the voltage sag characteristics of the network in faulty conditions, four strategies are introduced for coordination of protective devices. Simulation results are employed to study the network behavior under these protection strategies for fault durations of 200 ms, 600 ms and 1 s. The results are analyzed and compared with \{ITIC\} curves where fuses and reclosers are used as protection devices.

We assume that each individual has an inherent propensity to maintain his own word about an object whereas other individuals would affect his decision when they communicate. On the one hand, individuals learn the word of another one with a probability pertaining to their propensities. On the other hand, the focal individual would adopt the word held by the majority in a randomly selected group. We have numerically explored how dynamical behavior evolves as a result of combination of these two competing update patterns. A parameter governs the time scale ratio at which the two update patterns separately progress. We find that an increasing tendency to adopt the word held by the majority results in a rapid extinction of most words, thus more easily induces the system to a global consensus. Large initial probabilities denoting propensity are found to be unfavorable for the achievement of the consensus. Interestingly, simulation results indicate that the convergence time is negligibly affected by the number of initial distinct words when this number exceeds a certain value. Results from our model may offer an insight into better understanding the intricate dynamics of naming games.}}

In an attempt to standardize the purification of these proteins for structural studies we have developed a protocol to produce them individually in high concentration and purity. We show that IscS is a rather robust protein as long as it is produced in a \{PLP\} loaded form and that this co-factor is essential for fold stability and enzyme activity. In contrast to previous evidence, we also propose that, in contrast with previous evidence, IscU is a thermodynamically stable protein with a well defined fold but, when produced in isolation, is a â€˜complex-orphan proteinâ€™ that is prone to unfolding if not stabilised by a co-factor or a protein partner. Our work will facilitate further structural and functional studies of these proteins and eventually lead to a better understanding of the whole machinery.}}

One of the causative mechanisms of chronic kidney disease is thought to be oxidative stress. Cadmium induces oxidative stress, but the molecular mechanisms involved in the cell damage from oxidative stress in cadmium-induced chronic kidney disease are not well understood. Mitochondrial damage is likely, given that dysfunctional mitochondria are central to the formation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), and are known key intracellular targets for cadmium. Normally, \{ROS\} are balanced by natural anti-oxidant enzymes. When mitochondria become dysfunctional, for example, through long term exposure to environmental toxicants like cadmium, they produce less cell energy and more ROS. The imbalance between these \{ROS\} and the natural anti-oxidants creates the condition of oxidative stress. The outcomes of mitochondrial injury are manyfold: injured mitochondria perpetuate oxidative stress; the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential causes release of cytochrome-c and activation of caspase pathways that lead to apoptotic deletion of renal cells; and attempts by cells to remove dysfunctional mitochondria through autophagy lead to â€œautophagic cell deathâ€� or apoptosis. Three pathways of mitochondrial regulation (upstream signalling pathways, direct mitochondrial targeting, and downstream cell death effector pathways) are therefore all promising targets for effective anti-oxidant treatment of cadmium toxicity in the kidney.}}

Time-dependent constraints based on a signed-distance level set function have been added, so that the tree models will first be grown near the designated surface(s) and, then, gradually allowed to penetrate into the enclosed volume. The proposed technique has been applied to construct a model of the human cerebral vasculature, which is characterized by the above-mentioned distribution of the arteries.}}

However, their employment within large-scale commercial applications is still limited by issues related to the reliability of such components. In this work we present the Finite Element Method (FEM) modelling and preliminary experimental results concerning an active restoring mechanism, embedded within conventional MEMS/RF-MEMS ohmic (and capacitive) relays, capable of retrieving the normal operation of the switch if stiction occurs (i.e. the missed release of an actuated switch when the controlling bias is removed). The mechanism exploits the heat generated by an electric current flowing through an high-resistivity poly-silicon serpentine (Joule effect), to induce deformations in the suspended \{MEMS\} structures. Such changes in the mechanical structure result in shear and vertical restoring forces, helping the membrane release. The FEM-based thermo-electromechanical simulations discussed in this work include the coupling between different physical domains, starting from the imposed current, to the \{MEMS\} deformation. The preliminary experimental data reported in this paper show a speed-up of the dielectric discharge time due to the generated heat, as well as a change in the S-parameters, due to the membrane expansion, compatible with an upward bending of the central contact (i.e. restoring force), useful to counteracting stiction due to micro-welding.}}

Thus, regulation of FSHÎ² levels by activin is crucial for female reproductive fitness. This review discusses activin signaling pathways, transcription factors and FSHÎ² promoter elements required for activin responsiveness. Because FoxL2, a forkhead transcription factor, was recently shown to be instrumental in relaying activin signaling to the FSHÎ² promoter, we focus in this paper on its role and the inter-relatedness of several key players in activin responsiveness on the FSHÎ² promoter.}}

Since carrier shape has recently been recognized as an important design parameter for drug delivery, we sought to investigate how carrier shape influences their flow in the vasculature and their ability to target the diseased site. Idealized synthetic microvascular networks (SMNs) were used for this purpose since they closely mimic key physical aspects of real vasculature and at the same time offer practical advantages in terms of ease of use and direct observation of particle flow. The attachment propensities of surface functionalized spheres, elliptical/circular disks and rods with dimensions ranging from 1 Î¼m to 20 Î¼m were compared by flowing them through bifurcating SMNs. Particles of different geometries exhibited remarkably different adhesion propensities. Moreover, introduction of a bifurcation as opposed to the commonly used linear channel resulted in significantly different flow and adhesion behaviors, which may have important implications in correlating these results to in vivo behavior. This study provides valuable information for design of carriers for targeted drug delivery.}}

abstract = {Mucosal barrier function is critical to prevent translocation of microorganisms and their toxins. The intestinal barrier is made up of a single layer of columnar epithelium that can be readily breached by enteric infections, but has a tremendous capacity to repair. Thus, mucosal epithelial repair is one of the most critical elements of maintaining an intact barrier. In the small intestine, villous contraction is the initial phase of repair. Subsequent events include crawling of healthy epithelium adjacent to the wound, referred to as restitution. However, restoration of a continuous layer of epithelium is insufficient to restore barrier function. Recent ex vivo studies of porcine small intestine have revealed the importance of closure of the interepithelial tight junctions and the paracellular space. The critical role of tight junction closure is underscored by the prominent contribution of the paracellular space to measures of barrier function such as transepithelial electrical resistance. The net result of reparative mechanisms is remarkably rapid closure of mucosal wounds in porcine tissues to prevent the onset of sepsis.}}

The tube morphology affects flow rates of transported materials, such as liquids and gases. Therefore, it is important to understand how tube morphology is controlled. In Drosophila melanogaster many evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways have been shown to be involved in airway patterning. Recent studies identified a number of conserved mechanisms that drive Drosophila airway maturation, such as controlling tube size, barrier formation and lumen clearance. Genetically highly ordered branching modes previously have been found, also for mouse lung development. The understanding of tube patterning, outgrowth, ramification and maturation also is of clinical relevance, since many factors are evolutionarily conserved and may have similar functions in humans. This meeting report highlights novel findings concerning tube development in the fruit fly (D. melanogaster), the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus).}}

Inter-hemispheric F3â€“F4, C3â€“C4, T3â€“T4, T5â€“T6, P3â€“P4, O1â€“O2 and intra-hemispheric F3â€“P3, F4â€“P4, F3â€“T5, F4â€“T6, F3â€“O1, F4â€“O2, C3â€“O1, C2â€“O4 electrode pairs were included in the analysis. Repeated measures \{ANOVA\} revealed a significant difference between groups with regard to pre-treatment coherence values (p: 0.018). The coherence to the target stimuli at the right fronto-temporal location was significantly reduced by 35.41% in the patients compared to controls (p: 0.003). Patients showed significantly lower pre-treatment coherence values in response to non-target stimuli compared to controls at the right fronto-temporal (28.51%, p: 0.004), right fronto-occipital (23.71%, p: 0.024), and right centro-occipital (25.69%, p: 0.029) locations. After six weeks of valproate monotherapy, manic symptoms improved significantly. Post-treatment change in target and non-target coherence values was statistically non-significant. \{EEG\} coherence is a measure of functional connectivity in the brain. Event-related gamma oscillations are essential for brain electrical activity. The results show that acute mania presents right sided long distance connectivity disturbance, thus pointing to the potential importance of measuring oscillatory responses in the search for consistent neurobiological markers in such a complicated condition as bipolar disorder.}}

For gap-junctionally coupled networks we show that short delays can induce zigzag fronts of excitations, whereas long delays can further detriment synchronization due to a dynamic clustering anti-phase synchronization transition. For the synaptically coupled networks, on the other hand, we find that the clustering anti-phase synchronization can appear as a direct consequence of the prolongation of information transmission delay, without being accompanied by zigzag excitatory fronts. Irrespective of the coupling type, however, we show that an appropriate small-world topology can always restore synchronized activity if only the information transmission delays are short or moderate at most. Long information transmission delays always evoke anti-phase synchronization and clustering, in which case the fine-tuning of the network topology fails to restore the synchronization of neuronal activity.}}

Investigations in transgenic mouse models, in particular, have highlighted the importance of kisspeptin signaling at the level of the GnRH neuron itself in this process. This review aims to highlight current understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the kisspeptin activation of postnatal GnRH neurons. The three key features of the kisspeptinâ€“Gpr54â€“GnRH neuron axis leading up to puberty are (i) the expression of adult-like levels of Gpr54 mRNA in GnRH neurons well in advance of puberty, (ii) a modest increase in the electrical response of GnRH neurons to Gpr54 activation across postnatal development and (iii), the â€œsuddenâ€� appearance of kisspeptin fibers surrounding GnRH neuron cell bodies/proximal dendrites just prior to puberty onset. These kisspeptin fibers are likely to originate from the kisspeptin population located in the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V). Together, available data suggest that the key step in the kisspeptin control of puberty lies in the control of kisspeptin synthesis within \{RP3V\} kisspeptin neurons that innervate GnRH neurons. This has recently been shown to be dependent upon circulating estradiol concentrations. As such, we propose that \{RP3V\} kisspeptin neurons represent a critical estradiol-dependent amplification mechanism brought into play relatively late in pubertal development to activate GnRH neurons and complete the process of puberty onset. Subsequently, in the adult female, this same circuitry is used to activate GnRH neurons to generate the cyclical preovulatory GnRH/LH surge.}}

Multiple pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines were selected. We summed the multiples of the median for proinflammatory cytokines to generate the proinflammatory and the antiinflammatory scores. The relation between cervical length and pro-/antiinflammatory ratio was assessed by generalized estimating equations. Results The pro-/antiinflammatory ratio had a negative linear association with cervical length (Î² = â€“0.09; P &lt; .001). Sixty percent of visits demonstrated greater concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines relative to antiinflammatory cytokines. This relationship did not change between first and last visits. Conclusion Among women with a previous preterm birth, shorter mid-trimester cervical length is associated with a more proinflammatory balance of cytokines in the cervical inflammatory milieu.}}

Evidence is emerging that estrogens also induce rapid signaling to the downstream kinase cascades; however the mechanisms underlying this nongenomic function remain poorly understood. We have recently shown that ERÎ± is methylated specifically by the arginine methyltransferase \{PRMT1\} at arginine 260 in the DNA-binding domain of the receptor. This methylation event is required for mediating the extra-nuclear function of the receptor which would thereby interact with Src/FAK and p85 and propagate the signal to downstream transduction cascades that orchestrate cell proliferation and survival. Of particular interest, a possible role of methylated ERÎ± in mammary tumorigenesis is also evident by the fact that, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical studies on a cohort of breast cancer patients, ERÎ± is methylated in normal epithelial breast cells and is hypermethylated in a subset of breast cancers. Hypermethylation of ERÎ± in breast cancer might cause hyperactivation of cellular kinase signaling, notably of Akt, described as a selective survival advantage for primary tumor cells even in the presence of anti-estrogens. A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control estrogen signaling in breast cancer is a crucial step in identifying new effective therapies.}}

Representing a comparably novel science, rapid steroid actions have been recognized to carry potential clinical implications in various fields. Findings in this field have not yet been successfully translated into clinically relevant new medicines except for neurosteroids. A promising compound is the membrane estrogen receptor agonist STX, which may be applicable for estrogen withdrawal symptoms. Nongenomic vitamin D analogs may be useful as antiinflammatory, anticancer or diabetes preventing agents. Further the membrane thyroid receptor agonist tetrac may be useful in cancer treatment. Unfortunately lazaroids (membrane-only active glucocorticoids), which have been clinically tested as neuroprotective agents, had to be abandoned because of lacking clinical efficacy. Yet, the hierarchy of antirheumatic glucocorticoid action in regard to their clinical potency may better correlate with their membrane effects than their ability to bind to the classic glucocorticoid receptor. To improve the translational success of the rapid actions of steroids research, scientists should become familiar with major aspects of translational work and always seek for translational dimensions in their research.}}

abstract = {Ripening of banana (Musa acuminate L.) fruit is concomitant with weakening of disease resistance. The aim of this research was to determine the patterns of expression of \{PR1\} and chitinase genes during banana ripening. Northern blots show that the MaPR1 did not have expression in peel of young growing banana fruit, nor in harvested bananas until the onset of ripening. The chitinase gene (MaChit) had constitutive expression in bananas during development and after harvest. MaChit expression increased with time after harvest and reached the highest level at the onset of ripening when MaPR1 transcripts began to give detectable signals. Infection of the banana pathogen Colletotrichum musae did not induce MaPR1 but increased MaChit expression. The ethylene producer ethephon immediately induced MaPR1, but benzothiadiazole (BTH) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), when applied alone, did not. The combination of ethephon and \{BTH\} or MeJA treatment increased intensity of \{PR1\} signals 12 h after treatment compared with ethephon alone, and in the combination treatments, the inoculation-related lesions were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) smaller. In bananas treated with ethephon alone, the levels of MaPR1 and MaChit transcripts decreased in distal uninfected areas, but in a combination treatment, it did not decrease. The triple combination of ethephon, \{BTH\} and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) reduced MaPR1 and MaChit expression compared with a double combination of ethephon and BTH, whereas when MeJA replaced \{BTH\} in the triple treatment, the expression of the two genes increased compared with the double treatment. This research suggests that MaPR1 could be involved in defense mechanisms of ripe bananas, while MaChit could more be involved in banana resistance to disease before ripening. The results also suggest that \{BTH\} and MeJA-induced systemic defense in banana fruit is ethylene-dependent, and \{H2O2\} might be necessary in BTH-induced SAR, but not in MeJA-induced systemic resistance. In the banana industry, MaPR1 could be used as a molecular indicator for monitoring banana ripening.}}

abstract = {The class \{IIa\} histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9, have crucial roles in the development of the immune system and other organs, including brain, heart, and muscle. In addition to their catalytic domain, they are characterized by a large amino-terminal extension. The amino-terminal domain is subject to reversible phosphorylation, which controls their nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution. Unphosphorylated, class \{IIa\} \{HDACs\} remain in the nucleus, bound to chromatin, and repress transcription. Upon phosphorylation, they shuttle out of the nucleus, allowing derepression of their target genes. Thus, the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation is associated with derepression of target genes. Recent studies identified the kinases and phosphatases that regulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of class \{IIa\} HDACs. Here we will summarize this rapidly evolving field with a particular focus on the immune system.}}

Upon binding of the ligand, the vitamin D receptor heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and binds to vitamin D response elements in the promoter region of target genes to induce/repress their expression. The target genes that have been identified so far are heterogeneous in nature and reflect the great spectrum of biological activities of 1,25(OH)2D3. Within the last two decades, the receptor has been shown to be present not only in classical target tissues such as bone, kidney, and intestine, but also in many other nonclassical tissues, for example, in the immune system (T and B cells, macrophages, and monocytes), in the reproductive system (uterus, testis, ovary, prostate, placenta, and mammary glands), in the endocrine system (pancreas, pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal cortex), in muscles (skeletal, smooth, and heart muscles), and in brain, skin, and liver. Besides the almost universal presence of vitamin D receptors, different cell types (for example, keratinocytes, monocytes, bone, placenta) are capable of metabolizing 25-hydroxyvitamin \{D3\} to 1,25(OH)2D3 by the enzyme 25(OH)D3-1Î±-hydroxylase, encoded by CYP27B1. The combined presence of \{CYP27B1\} and the specific receptor in several tissues introduced the idea of a paracrine/autocrine role for 1,25(OH)2D3. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 can induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of normal and malignant cells. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk for nearly all major human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. In addition to the treatment of bone disorders with 1,25(OH)2D3, these newly discovered functions open perspectives for the use of 1,25(OH)2D3 as an immune modulator (for example, for the treatment of autoimmune diseases or prevention of graft rejection), inhibitor of cell proliferation, and inducer of cell differentiation (cancer).}}

However, if we increase the level of the reversal voltage in the calcium ion channel, the exact synchrony firing of neurons is produced. Patterns of synchrony activity and the stability are observed to vary with the choice of time delay, which also enhances the multi-variety of the spike bursting firing rhythm. The lag synchrony of time trajectories of the voltage is illustrated near the boundary of the synchrony regime.}}

Pterostilbene, a natural dimethylated analog of resveratrol, is known to have diverse pharmacological activities including anti-cancer, anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant activities. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of pterostilbene on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced \{VSMCs\} proliferation as well as the molecular mechanisms of the antiproliferative effects. The cell growth of \{VSMCs\} was determined by cell counting and [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. Pterostilbene significantly inhibited the \{DNA\} synthesis and proliferation of PDGF-BB-stimulated \{VSMCs\} in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition percentages of pterostilbene at 1, 3 and 5 Î¼M to \{VSMCs\} proliferation were 68.5, 80.7 and 94.6%, respectively. The \{DNA\} synthesis of pterostilbene at 1, 3 and 5 Î¼M in \{VSMCs\} was inhibited by 47.4, 76.7 and 100%, respectively. Pterostilbene inhibited the PDGF-BB-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt kinase. However, pterostilbene did not change the expression of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2, PLCÎ³1, phosphatidylinositol (PI)3 kinase and PDGF-RÎ² phosphorylation. In addition, pterostilbene down-regulated the cell cycle-related proteins including the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, cyclin E, CDK4, cyclin D1, retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins and proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). These findings suggest that the inhibition of pterostilbene to the cell proliferation and \{DNA\} synthesis of PDGF-BB-stimulated \{VSMCs\} may be mediated by the suppression of Akt kinase. Furthermore, pterostilbene may be a potential anti-proliferative agent for the treatment of atherosclerosis and angioplasty restenosis.}}

Using the indirect \{RP\} technique, a three-component scaffold with a woodpile structure, consisting of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA), chitosan and hydroxyapatite (HA) microspheres, was produced that had a macroporosity of more than 50% together with micropores induced by lyophilization. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the preparation and construction of the composite scaffold did not affect the phase composition of the HA. The compressive strength and elastic modulus (E) for the \{PLLA\} composites are 0.42 and 1.46 MPa, respectively, which are much higher than those of chitosan/HA composites and resemble the properties of cellular structure. These scaffolds showed excellent biocompatibility and ability for three-dimensional tissue growth of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblastic cells. The pre-osteoblastic cells cultured on these scaffolds formed a network on the \{HA\} microspheres and proliferated not only in the macropore channels but also in the micropores, as seen from the histological analysis and electron microscopy.

In agreement with the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA), vascular lesions are classified into haemangiomas as proliferating endothelial tumours on the one hand and congenital vascular malformations on the other. According to the preponderant vascular channels and hemodynamic characteristics, malformations are subdivided into low flow (venous, lymphatic and capillary) lesions and high-flow malformations. Diagnostic imaging should be targeted at the specific structural and functional informations required for treatment planning. The imaging modality of choice to provide these informations is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) supplemented by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Treatment indications for haemangiomas depend on the proliferative behaviour of the lesion and comprise Î²-blockers in order to induce involution as well as cryotherapy, laser and open surgery. Interventional radiological procedures have evolved as an essential element in an interdisciplinary treatment plan for vascular malformations and include percutaneous sclerotherapy with ethanol and OK-432 for venous and lymphatic malformations and transarterial embolization for high-flow lesions.}}

Boolean networks (BN) and its generalization probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs) have been proposed to model genetic regulatory interactions. \{BN\} is a deterministic model while \{PBN\} is a stochastic model. In a PBN, on one hand, its stationary distribution gives important information about the long-run behavior of the network. On the other hand, one may be interested in system synthesis which requires the construction of networks from the observed stationary distribution. This results in an inverse problem which is ill-posed and challenging. Because there may be many networks or no network having the given properties and the size of the inverse problem is huge. In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing \{PBNs\} from a given stationary distribution and a set of given Boolean Networks (BNs). We first formulate the inverse problem as a constrained least squares problem. We then propose a heuristic method based on Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm, an iterative method, to solve the resulting least squares problem. We also introduce an estimation method for the parameters of the PBNs. Numerical examples are then given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}}

abstract = {Background Angiogenesis is of major interest in developmental biology and cancer research. Different experimental approaches are available to study angiogenesis that have in common the need for microscopy, image acquisition, and analysis. Problems that are encountered hereby are the size of the structures, which requires generation of composite images and difficulties in quantifying angiogenic activity reliably and rapidly. Most graphic software packages lack some of the required functions for easy, semiautomatic quantification of angiogenesis and, consequently, multiple software packages or expensive programs have to be used to cover all necessary functions. Methods and Results A software package (AQuaL) to analyze angiogenic activity was developed using Java, which can be used platform-independently. It includes image acquisition relying on the Java Media Framework and an easy to use image alignment tool. Multiple overlapping images can be aligned and saved without limitations and loss of resolution into a composite image, which requires only the selection of a single point representing a characteristic structure in adjacent images. Angiogenic activity can be quantified in composite images semiautomatically by the assessment of the area overgrown by cells after filteringÂ and image binarization. In addition, tagging of capillary-like structures allows quantification of their length and branching pattern. Both developed methods deliver reliable and correlating data as exemplified inÂ the aortic ring angiogenesis assay. Conclusion The developed software provides modular functions specifically targeted to quantify angiogenesis. Whereas the area measurement is time saving, length measurement provides additional information about the branching patterns, which is required for a qualitative differentiation of capillary growth.}}

Herein, we attempt to sample the latest information in the field of non-genomic \{GC\} signalling in T cells, and correlate it with results from our laboratory. We discuss some aspects of the regulation of thymocyte apoptosis by GCs, paying special interest to the potential role(s) of mitochondrial \{GR\} signalling.

Although the main components of the RNAi/miRNA pathway have been identified, the molecular mechanisms regulating the activity of the RNAi/miRNA pathway have only begun to emerge within the last couple of years. Recently, high-throughput reporter assays to monitor the activity of the RNAi/miRNA pathway have been developed and used for proof-of-concept pilot screens. Both inhibitors and activators of the RNAi/miRNA pathway have been found.

The critical temperature for peptide degradation was 100 Â°C, and above it, peptides degraded quickly in thermal degradation system. However, in Maillard reaction system, peptides cross-linked rapidly when the temperature reached 110 Â°C. Bitter amino acids and peptides below 1000 Da decreased 18.44% and 28.49%, respectively, after Maillard reaction at 120 Â°C.

Since nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) controls the expression of many genes associated to inflammation-related diseases, in this study we have investigated the role of NF-ÎºB signaling in the regulation of Nox1 and Nox4 transcription in human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Cultured cells were exposed to tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±), a potent inducer of both Nox and NF-ÎºB, up to 24 h. Lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence and dichlorofluorescein assays, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of NF-ÎºB pathway reduced significantly the TNFÎ±-dependent up-regulation of Nox-derived reactive oxygen species production, Nox1 and Nox4 expression. In silico analysis indicated the existence of typical NF-ÎºB elements in the promoters of Nox1 and Nox4. Transient overexpression of p65/NF-ÎºB significantly increased the promoter activities of both isoforms. Physical interaction of p65/NF-ÎºB proteins with the predicted sites was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. These findings demonstrate that NF-ÎºB is an essential regulator of Nox1- and Nox4-containing \{NADPH\} oxidase in SMCs. Elucidation of the complex relationships between NF-ÎºB and Nox enzymes may lead to a novel pharmacological strategy to reduce both inflammation and oxidative stress in atherosclerosis and its associated complications.}}

Inhibition of MT1-MMP by \{MMP\} inhibitor or small interfering \{RNA\} suppressed activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and \{ERK\} in MT1-MMP-expressing cancer cells, which resulted in up-regulation of p21WAF1 and suppression of cell growth in collagen gel. Cell proliferation was also abrogated by the inhibitor against \{ERK\} pathway without affecting \{FAK\} phosphorylation. MT1-MMP and integrin Î±vÎ²3 were shown to be involved in c-Src activation, which induced \{FAK\} and \{ERK\} activation in collagen gel. These MT1-MMP-mediated signal transductions were paxillin dependent, as knockdown of paxillin reduced cell growth and \{ERK\} activation, and co-expression of MT1-MMP with paxillin induced \{ERK\} activation. The results suggest that MT1-MMP contributes to proliferation of cancer cells in the extracellular matrix by activating \{ERK\} through c-Src and paxillin.}}

Familial occurrence of \{GCMN\} reported in literature is reviewed and an overview of the embryology and proliferation given, illustrating the plethora of factors that might lead to \{GCMN\} formation. The pattern of inheritance is likely not Mendelian and discordance in identical twins and the segmental distribution of lesions suggest a post-zygotic mutation. A polygenic paradominant inheritance best explains the clinically observed transmission pattern. Candidate genes include those influencing neural crest development and melanocyte proliferation.}}

Both, active and reactive wind farm powers are employed in two independent control laws in order to increase the damping of the oscillation modes of a power system. In this way, it presented a general strategy where two correction terms are added, one by each independent control, to the normal operating condition of a wind farm. The proposed control laws are derived from the Lyapunov approach. Meanwhile for the reactive power a non-linear correction is presented, for the wind farm active power it is demonstrated that the classical proportional and inertial laws can be considered via the Lyapunov approach if wind farms are considered as real power plants, i.e. equivalent to conventional synchronous generation. Finally, some simulations are presented in order to support the theoretical considerations demonstrating the potential contributions of both control laws.}}

abstract = {Background Rotator cuff tears are common shoulder problems whose propagation is difficult to predict because of the structural and mechanical inhomogeneity of the supraspinatus tendon. We have previously shown that the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons interact mechanically when the supraspinatus tendon is intact or exhibits a full-thickness tear, so that an increase in supraspinatus tendon strain is paralleled by an increase in infraspinatus tendon strain. Such interaction is critical and suggests that an increase in infraspinatus tendon strain that accompanies an increase in supraspinatus tendon strain may shield the supraspinatus tendon from further injury, but increase the risk of injury to the infraspinatus tendon. In this study, the mechanical interactions between the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were evaluated for the commonly occurring supraspinatus tendon partial-thickness tears through a range of rotation angles. Methods For each joint rotation and supraspinatus tendon tear size evaluated, the supraspinatus tendon was loaded, and images corresponding to 5 N, 30 N, 60 N, and 90 N of supraspinatus tendon load were isolated for the speckle painted supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons. A region of interest outlining the insertion site was isolated and displacements between the 5 N loaded image and each of the others were measured, from which normalized average principal strains were quantified in both tendons. Results The observed effect on infraspinatus tendon strain paralleled that observed on strain in the supraspinatus tendon. Introducing a supraspinatus tendon partial-thickness tear and increasing load caused an increase in normalized average maximum and a decrease in normalized average minimum principal strain in the infraspinatus tendon. Increasing rotation angle from internal to external rotation caused a general decrease in normalized average maximum and increase in normalized average minimum principal strain in both tendons. Conclusion The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons mechanically interact for the intact and partially torn supraspinatus tendons for neutral and rotated glenohumeral joint.}}

Attempts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying malignant and metastatic transformation are primarily motivated by the desire to identify specific molecules and signaling pathways that can serve as targets for novel therapies. In recent years, such studies were reinforced by major technological and conceptual developments: novel and powerful tools for genomic and proteomic analysis have been developed, and advanced computational approaches offer â€œsystems-levelâ€� integration of rich and complex biological datasets into meaningful functional networks.

Results: Smoking was independently associated with \{ESCC\} (p &lt; 0.05, OR: 2.286, 95% \{CI\} = 1.311â€“3.983). Smoking along with \{GSTP1\} Val/Val genotype was associated to \{ESCC\} (p &lt; 0.001, OR: 3.886, 95% \{CI\} = 1.830â€“8.251), while non-smokers with \{GSTP1\} Val/Val were significantly more frequent in non-cancerous group. (p = 0.007, OR: 0.507, 95% \{CI\} = 0.309â€“0.830). Conclusions: Data-mining methods are useful tools to map out a scheme for predicting complex relations and combinations of different genotypes. Genotyping analysis of \{GSTP1\} together with assessment of smoking seems to be important in determining the risk of \{ESCC\} in the Iranian population.}}

Significant amounts of glucose (ca. 23%) could be produced from cellulose in the absence of CaCO3 for reaction in water at 523Â K and 12Â min reaction time. On the other hand, in the presence of CaCO3, most glucose decomposed over all conditions, whereas the addition of talc and kaolin to the mixtures increased the glucose yield to about 30%. For the case of chemical recycle of paper sludge with hydrothermal treatment to obtain d-glucose, it can be concluded that it is preferable to separate the calcium carbonate from the paper sludge before hydrothermal treatment.}}

Several factors, including wall shear stress (WSS), plaque morphology and peak cap stress, have been associated with plaque vulnerability. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between these factors in an in vivo human ruptured carotid plaque. Methods A 74-year-old male presenting with a transient ischemic attack underwent carotid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which indicated a ruptured plaque, followed by carotid endarterectomy, from which plaque histology was assessed. The carotid bifurcation was reconstructed from the \{MRI\} data, and three-dimensional flow simulations were performed using computational fluid dynamics to determine \{WSS\} and related parameters. Plaque vulnerability was assessed using a biomechanical method based on modified Glagov criteria. Results The plaque rupture was just distal to the site of maximum stenosis in a region of low WSS, where \{MRI\} and histology both demonstrated fibrous cap thinning, a large lipid pool and calcification in the shoulder region. Plaque vulnerability analysis indicated critically vulnerable plaque at the rupture site by a wide margin. Conclusions Both low and high \{WSS\} have been associated with plaque vulnerability, and high mechanical stress in the cap has been linked to plaque rupture, but these parameters are not routinely assessed clinically.

Infected BALB/c mice developed increased lesion size associated with strong inflammatory infiltrate diffusely distributed in the dermis, with highly infected macrophages. The humoral immune response was predominantly directed toward the IgG1 isotype. The functional activity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed significantly increased TNF-Î± mRNA levels associated with reduced IFN-Î³ expression by CD4+ T cells and the double negative (dn) \{CD4CD8\} cell subset. High IL-4 levels expressed by CD8+ T cells and dnCD4CD8 and TGF-Î² by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected, while IL-10 was highly expressed by all three cell subpopulations. Taken together, these results show an evident imbalance between TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³ that is unfavorable to amastigote replication control. Furthermore, L. shawi seems to regulate different cell populations to express deactivating cytokines to avoid its own destruction. This study indicates BALB/c mice as a potentially good experimental model for further studies on American cutaneous leishmaniosis caused by L. shawi.}}

In this study, the strain experienced by individual osteocytes resulting from an applied fluid flow shear stress was quantified and correlated to two biological responses measured in real-time within the same individual osteocytes: (1) the upregulation of intracellular calcium and (2) changes in intracellular nitric oxide. Osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells were loaded with Fluo-4 \{AM\} and DAR-4M and exposed to uniform laminar fluid flow shear stresses of 2, 8, or 16 dyn/cm2. Intracellular calcium and nitric oxide changes were determined by measuring the difference in fluorescence intensity from the cellâ€™s basal level prior to fluid flow and the level immediately following exposure. Individual cell strains were calculated using digital image correlation. MLO-Y4 cells showed a linear increase in cell strain, intracellular calcium concentration, and nitric oxide concentration with an increase in applied fluid flow rate. The increase in intracellular calcium was well correlated to the strain that each cell experienced. This study shows that osteocytes exposed to the same fluid flow experienced a range of individual strains and changes in intracellular calcium and nitric oxide concentrations, and the changes in intracellular calcium were correlated with cell strain. These results are among the first to establish a relationship between the strain experienced by osteocytes in response to fluid flow shear and a biological response at the single cell level. Mechanosensing and chemical signaling in osteocytes has been hypothesized to occur at the single cell level, making it imperative to understand the biological response of the individual cell.}}

Two groups of Al resonance lines were observed below Td (=335 K), whereas above Td the resonance lines of the two groups were reduced to one Al signal. The presence of only one 27Al resonance line Td is due to the structural phase transition. The changes in the temperature dependences of the \{T1\} and \{T2\} near Td are related to the loss of H2O, which probably disrupts the forms of the octahedral of water molecules surrounding Al3+. In addition, the Î±-alum NH4Al(SO4)2Â·12H2O can be distinguished from the Î±-alum RbAl(SO4)2Â·12H2O and the Î²-alum CsAl(SO4)2Â·12H2O on the basis of the temperature dependences of T1.}}

In this coupled system, the diversity is represented by a negative conductance with a bounded random distribution for each circuit module. We find that the diversity-induced transition, which forces the system from monostable to bistable, is of key importance for the emergence of resonance. An order parameter expansion theory and a reduced theory are used for analysis. All these findings suggest that diversity-induced resonance can be more generally observed, such as in monostable media and in experimental systems.}}

Proteolysis is one of the deleterious events implicated in preservation injury of organ allografts. This strongly affects graft quality and hence immediate organ function. Since donor catecholamine treatment improves transplantation outcome after renal transplantation, the present study was conducted to examine the influence of dopamine (DA) pretreatment on hypothermia induced proteolysis in endothelial cells subjected to prolonged cold storage. Materials and Methods Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, two-dimensional electrophoresis, ubiquitination analysis, intracellular calcium measurement, and Western blot analysis were performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) subjected to hypothermic preservation or not. Results \{HUVEC\} were highly susceptible to cold storage, which was reflected by morphological changes, loss of viability, and by significant changes in cellular proteome. \{DA\} pretreatment prevented cell death during cold storage. Western blot analysis demonstrated a time dependent up-regulation of calpain 1 and 2 during cold storage, which could be prevented by addition of EDTA. \{DA\} pretreatment abolished autoproteolysis of calpain 1. Analysis of ubiquitination revealed a significant increase in ubiquitinated conjugates after cold storage. This was not prevented by \{DA\} pretreatment. Neither proteasome nor calpain inhibitors prevented cell death during cold storage. Conclusion In endothelial cells subjected to cold preservation, activation of the calpain pathway and the ubiquitin proteasome system occur. Although \{DA\} pretreatment inhibits the former, calpain inhibition did not protect endothelial cells during cold storage. \{DA\} pretreatment might influence proteolysis, but proteolysis is not the major cause of endothelial cell death.}}

We unveil that several kinases contain potential KTIMs, mostly located within their kinase domain and appearing predominantly at the level of early vertebrates becoming highly conserved thereafter. Regarding the \{KTIMs\} that were found conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates, we provide experimental data suggesting that such motifs may have constituted readily available sites that performed new regulatory functions as soon as their binding partners (e.g. SHP-1) appeared in vertebrates.

abstract = {Introduction ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium silicate cements are able to set in a moist environment. The aim of the study was to examine the surface structure and composition of a cement paste under wet conditions and in real time during setting by environmental scanning electron microscopy connected with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (ESEM-EDX) and micro-Raman techniques. Methods White ProRoot \{MTA\} and experimental white tetrasilicate cement (wTC) and wTC containing bismuth oxide (wTC-Bi) were studied. Cement disks were analyzed 10 minutes after powder-liquid mixing (freshly prepared samples) and after immersion in Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline at 37Â°C for 24 hours (24-hour-aged samples). Results Freshly prepared wet cements at ESEM-EDX exposed an irregular surface (displaying calcium, silicon, aluminum, chlorine reflexes, and bismuth traces in \{MTA\} and wTC-Bi) with needle-like and cubic-hexagonal shaped crystals. Aggregates of spheroidal Ca-Pâ€“rich crystals (spherulites) appeared on the surface of 24-hour-aged samples. The starting unhydrated powders displayed the typical Raman bands of Portland cement components: alite, belite, and calcium sulfate (only as anhydrite in \{MTA\} and as both anhydrite and gypsum in wTC and wTC-Bi). \{MTA\} powder showed higher amount of calcium carbonate and lower quantities of anhydrite and higher crystallinity of the silicate component, leading to a slower hydration reaction. Products/markers of hydration reactions were present on fresh samples; ettringite formed on the surface of all the cements; calcium hydroxide (portlandite) was detected only on the surface of wTC, but no conclusion can be drawn on wTC-Bi and \{MTA\} because of the interference of bismuth oxide. Calcium phosphate and calcite/aragonite bands were detected on all 24-hour-aged cements; portlandite was no longer detected on wTC. Conclusions \{ESEM\} and micro-Raman are powerful and suitable techniques to investigate endodontic calcium silicate hydrated cements in real time and in their humid state without inducing artifacts by sample preparation. The formation of apatite spherulites on calcium silicate cements might have clinical relevance.}}

However, more complex topologies are becoming popular within social networking community. An example of such structure is a Folksonomy: a tuple of connections among users, resources and tags. An intuitive way to represent a Folksonomy is a three-mode hypergraph. It has been shown that in such graphs a clustering coefficient decreases slowly over time at very high level and this property is unachievable for simple random hypergraphs. In this article we represent a Folksonomy as a tripartite graph. This small change of perspective enables us to divide graph generation process into two steps and adapt algorithms used for bipartite graph generation at each step. As a result we obtain iteratively graphs that reflect both dynamics and high level of clustering coefficient.}}

Theoretically an ex vivo perfused model of the liver should, by dissociating the organ from the extrinsic regulatory mechanisms, allow a better and unequivocal analysis of changes obtained. Materials and Methods Twelve livers were harvested from female pigs and perfused for 6 h. Hypoxia was produced by means of isovolemic hemodilution with hemoglobin and hematocrit reduced to 40% of the baseline value. The extracorporeal circuit included a centrifugal pump, heat exchanger, and oxygenator. Every hour, physiological parameters (arterial/portal venous pressures and flows) were measured and blood samples were collected for the analysis of hemoglobin, red blood cells, hematocrit, lactate, glucose, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, arterial and venous blood gases. The arterio-venous oxygen and carbon dioxide differences, and the hepatic metabolic rate for oxygen, were also calculated. Primary endpoint of the study was the glucose response of the liver to acute hypoxia. Secondary endpoints were eventual changes of markers for hepatic viability and functionality. Results Most parameters showed significant variability during the first h of perfusion but subsequently normalized and remained stable at baseline values for the following 5 h. A strong and significant hyperglycemic response was present throughout theÂ experiment (P &lt; 0.001). Lactate rose steadily throughout the study period and after 6 h of perfusion there was a significant deviation from initial values (PÂ &lt; 0.05). Albumin did not change significantly throughout the study although a trend towards decreasing values was observed (Friedman test, P = NS). After an initial rise in levels of alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase following perfusion (PÂ &lt; 0.01), values remained constant without any further increase. Conclusions Following reperfusion in an ex vivo model, the liver reacts to low oxygen concentrations mobilizing glycogen deposits. This mechanism depends on an intrinsic sensibility of hepatocytes to hypoxia, as demonstrated by the ex vivo liver perfusion. These findings improve our knowledge in organ preservation for liver transplantation.}}

Methods Striae gravidarum score was assessed using the Atwal numerical scoring system. The association was examined between \{PT\} as the outcome measure, defined by tears or laceration, and the total striae scores (TSS) obtained at the abdomen, hips, buttocks, and breast. Results Significantly higher \{TSS\} scores were found in women with \{PT\} compared with women without \{PT\} (3.60Â±0.39 vs. 2.31Â±0.23, p=.003). Specifically, striae scores at the breast and hips were significantly higher among women who had PT. Logistic regression analysis revealed that \{TSS\} (OR=0.079; 95% \{CI\} 1.012, 1.151; p=.021), as well as a rise in body mass index (BMI) during pregnancy (OR=1.025; 95% \{CI\} 1.001, 1.049; p=.043) are significant predictors of PT.

The \{ATP\} level was increased when membrane integrity was affected by 0.5% butanol, and further increased by compound 23.1, a semisynthetic phenol lipid derivative that acts as inhibitor of Pdr5p and Snq2p pumps. The magnitude of increase in cell \{ATP\} caused by inhibition of Pdr5p pump by compound 23.1 and the Pdr5p pump inhibitor \{FK506\} used for comparison reflects the activity and hence the energy demand of the pump.

Results of previous studies conducted in Switzerland have shown that the prevalence of antibody-positive animals is high and that \{BVDV\} is widespread in the country causing serious economic losses. A new approach to eradicate \{BVD\} in the cattle population in Switzerland was chosen. It consists in testing the whole Swiss cattle population for virus detection in a short period of time, without initial antibody screening. Identified persistently infected (PI) animals have to be slaughtered, and new herd infections should be avoided by movement restrictions. Ear-notches are collected using special tags for labeling the animals, and are analyzed using \{ELISA\} or rtRT-PCR methods. Confirmatory tests if needed are performed on blood samples using rtRT-PCR. The eradication program is divided into four phases: (1) Pre-pasturing phase: all young bovines going to transhumance in summer have to be negative tested before. (2) Initial phase: all non-tested bovines have to be tested. Movement restrictions are effective at the same time. (3) Calves phase: all newborn calves have to be tested. (4) Surveillance phase: several strategies will be compared using a modeling approach. After the pre-pasture phase already 595,230 animals (37% of the livestock) have been tested within four months. A prevalence of 1.1% of \{PIs\} was observed. The average age of infected animals is 403 days compared to 794 days for non-infected animals, with the oldest PI-animal being over 11 years old. On average PI-animals are slaughtered within 18 days after the last positive result. The pre-pasture phase has shown that sampling and testing a high number of animals in a short time is challenging but possible. The next phase will deal with double the number of animals in a similar time frame. The coordination between all partners as well as the collaboration of farmers is the key factor for ensuring the success of the program.}}

In order to examine the role of \{ARFRP1\} for \{GLUT4\} targeting, subcellular distribution of \{GLUT4\} was investigated in adipose tissue specific Arfrp1 knockout (Arfrp1adâˆ’/âˆ’) mice. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies of brown adipocytes demonstrated an abnormal trans-Golgi in Arfrp1adâˆ’/âˆ’ adipocytes. In addition, in Arfrp1adâˆ’/âˆ’ adipocytes \{GLUT4\} protein accumulated at the plasma membrane rather than being sequestered in an intracellular compartment. A similar missorting of \{GLUT4\} was produced by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Arfrp1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes which was associated with significantly elevated uptake of deoxyglucose under basal conditions. Thus, Arfrp1 appears to be involved in sorting of GLUT4.}}

The relaxation times of the 27Al and 133Cs nuclei in the two crystals undergo significant changes at the temperature lower than the phase transition temperature TC. The variations in the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time \{T1\} near \{TC\} are related to the changes in the symmetry of the octahedra of water molecules surrounding Al3+ and Cs+. The Cs relaxation time in CsCr(SO4)2Â·12H2O is faster than that in CsAl(SO4)2Â·12H2O at 300 K; the spin-lattice relaxation time is inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic moment of the paramagnetic ion.

Since then, little work has been dedicated to this system, apart from some detailed mineralogical studies. Here we place the AÃ¯n Khamouda karsts in their regional geological framework, which is marked by the presence of large basinal-scale \{MVT\} Pbâ€“Zn deposit (e.g. at the Djebel Chambi, âˆ¼10 km to the south of the study area). The karsts are deepening along faults in Turonianâ€“Coniacian limestone (the Douleb Fm), under a Tortonian sandy cover (the Beglia sand) that is withdrawn within the karst infilling. This makes a Tortonian or post-Tortonian age for the karstification likely, as for other comparable karsts located to the northwest of the study area, in the Algerian Constantinois. In AÃ¯n Khamouda, the mineralization sequence is a variant of the classical gypsum â†’ iron oxide â†’ silicates sequence, with some specific characteristics inherited from the regional Pbâ€“Zn background: a 7 Ã… Zn-clay (berthierine) has been identified, mixed with halloysite, and calamine minerals (hemimorphite, smithsonite) are found in voids and fractures within the karstic system. Undersaturated meteoric fluids flowing downward meet pre-existing or recently formed base metals sulphides, in the subsurface. In the AÃ¯n Khamouda area, the downward deepening of karsts along major regional faults brings meteoric fluids in contact with base metal sulphides. The oxidation of base metals sulphides results in the release of sulphuric acid, which also accounts for an increased karstification. Late processes occurring in the Beglia sand appear to be complex, though somewhat anecdotic in terms of volumes. They essentially consist in recurring cycles of reduction (among which biochemical reduction of galena) and oxidation (including the formation of jarosite). The study area offers the opportunity to investigate (1) a karstic system where deepening caves meet pre-existing base metal sulphides, and (2) the consequences this specific setting has, in terms of minerals found within the karst: presence of Zn-bearing clays (berthierine), formation of calamine minerals, minor cycling of lead in the late phases.}}

The molecular mechanisms and the key players involved in this highly coordinate process, as well as its immunological outcome constitute a vividly expanding field of scientific interest. A plethora of studies provided a detailed understanding of the interaction site between the dying cell and the phagocyte, as well as to the current concept that apoptotic cell removal leads to a non- or anti-inflammatory response, whereas necrotic cell removal stimulates a pro-inflammatory reaction. In contrast, our current knowledge about the soluble factors released from apoptotic cells is rather limited, although meanwhile it is generally accepted that not only the dying cell itself but also the substances, which are liberated during cell death, contribute to the process of corpse clearance and the subsequent immune response. This review is intended to summarize the up-to-date knowledge about apoptotic cell-derived attraction signals, their function as phagocytic chemoattractants, their influence on the immune system, and the receptors, which are engaged in this scenario.}}

A series of immobilized lipases such as Candida antarctica lipase B, Mucor miehei lipase and Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase were screened to establish that C. antarctica lipase B was the best lipase for hydrazinolysis. When phenyl benzoate (0.01 mol) and hydrazine (0.02 mol) in toluene (15 ml) were reacted with C. antarctica lipase B (Novozym 435) at 50 Â°C, 95% of phenyl benzoate was converted to benzoic acid hydrazide after 2 h. The effects of various parameters such as speed of agitation, concentration of the substrates, temperature, enzyme concentration, and reusability of the enzyme were studied to deduce kinetics and mechanism of the reaction. A mechanism based on an ordered biâ€“bi dead end complex with hydrazine was found to fit the data. Systematic deactivation studies indicated that the enzyme was deactivated due to the hydrazine and phenol, enzyme deactivation obeys first-order series model. The kinetic parameters deduced from these models were used to simulate the lipase activity. There was a very good agreement between the simulated and experimental values.}}

Disruption of these signals by exogenous substances (both natural and synthetic) frequently produce phenotypic effects that can persist into adulthood and influence reproduction. This paper reviews the evidence that during embryonic development, progesterone metabolites and xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors may interact to increase the expression of numerous enzymes responsible for steroid metabolism in oviparous and placental amniotes. In these groups, embryonic development is characterized by (1) elevated progesterone concentrations, (2) 5Î² reduction being the primary metabolic pathway of progesterone, (3) the presence of xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors that can bind 5Î² metabolites of progesterone, and (4) increased expression of a suite of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of multiple steroids. We propose that xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors initially evolved to buffer the developing embryo from the potentially adverse effects of various maternal steroids on sexual differentiation.}}

Three dominant signals were measured: choline (Cho), total creatine (tCr), and n-acetylaspartate (NAA) and expressed as ratios of Cho:tCr, NAA:tCr, NAA:Cho and NAA:(Cho+tCr). We compared the data from three hippocampal regions: head, body and tail. Results Lower NAA:tCr ratios were found in head compared with the body (p&lt;0.05) and in the head compared with the tail (p&lt;0.05) bilaterally. Lower NAA:Cho and NAA:(Cho+tCr) ratios were found in the head compared with the body (p&lt;0.05), in the body compared with the tail (p&lt;0.05), and in the head compared with the tail (p&lt;0.05) bilaterally. There was no statistically significant difference between the left and the right hippocampus. Conclusion Ratios of NAA:tCr, NAA:Cho, and NAA:(Cho+tCr) in hippocampal tissue were significantly higher posteriorly than anteriorly. As the differences are present in healthy volunteers, the appearance in patients related to approximate voxel positioning within hippocampi may result in false-positive results.}}

Three premolars and 3 incisors that received only rubber/pumice prophylaxis were used as control groups \{G3\} and G4, respectively. Two days after the bleaching procedure, the teeth were extracted and processed for histologic evaluation. Results Only in \{G2\} (4 incisors) were any changes in the pulp detected. In the coronal pulp there was a large zone of coagulation necrosis. The radicular pulp showed mild inflammatory changes manifested as an accumulation of mononuclear cells around congested and dilated blood vessels. No pulpal damage was seen in either of the control groups (G3 and G4) or in group G1.

The cortical response to repeated sensory stimuli rapidly adapts and different frequencies recruit cortical neuronal networks to different extents. \{GABAergic\} inhibition limits the spread of excitation within cortical neuronal networks. However, it is unknown how frequency adaptation of cortical network activity at different frequencies is shaped by \{GABAergic\} inhibition. Here, we find that in acute slices of visual cortex area \{V1\} \{GABAergic\} inhibition affects frequency adaptation depending on the frequency of activity. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that while increasing inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) with flunitrazepam dampened the spread of cortical excitation, short-term adaptations to different stimulation frequencies were differentially affected. At high frequencies (40 Hz), facilitation of cortical excitation was no longer transient, but facilitation was sustained. At low frequencies (10 Hz) flunitrazepam decreased a depression of the excitation. In contrast, in mice lacking the \{GABAA\} receptor alpha1 subunit facilitation was reduced and depression enhanced. These findings suggest that \{GABAergic\} inhibition affects cortical excitation at different frequencies differentially, favoring facilitation at higher frequencies of excitation.}}

Cu uptake was gradually declined by Zn. The induction of oxidative stress is shown by increased levels of lipid peroxidation, total peroxide, superoxide anion and lipoxygenase activity. Zn interaction reduced the oxidative damage. However, only Zn-treated plants did not show alteration in the above observed parameters. The activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase showed a very high increase in activity in Cu + Zn treatment as compared to Cu or Zn alone-treated plants.

The results showed that bread with the addition of \{GSE\} had stronger antioxidant activity than that of blank bread, and increasing the level of \{GSE\} addition further enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the bread. However, thermal processing caused antioxidant activity of \{GSE\} added to bread to decrease by around 30â€“40%. We also studied the effect of \{GSE\} on the formation of detrimental NÎµ-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), a famous advanced glycation endproduct in bread. According to the results, \{GSE\} could reduce \{CML\} in bread and acted in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, except for an acceptable colour change, adding \{GSE\} to bread had only little effect on the quality attributes of the bread. Altogether, our findings indicate that GSE-fortified bread is promising to be developed as a functional food with relatively lower CML-related health risks, yet a high antioxidant activity.}}

Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR), a physiological compound with role in bioenergetic functions, shows an antihyperalgesic effect and at the same time can exert neuroregenerative and neuroprotective effects. Aimed to explore the link between pain and neuroregeneration, the effect of \{ALCAR\} treatment (100 mg kgâˆ’1 i.p. twice daily for 15 days) on PKCÎ³ and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) expression has been evaluated in \{CCI\} (chronic constriction injury) rats. The sciatic nerve and the lumbar tract of the spinal cord were processed to evaluate the levels of the phosphorylated form of PKCÎ³, \{ERK\} 1,2, SAP/JNK, p-38 and c-Jun; furthermore, the mRNA expression of the early genes c-Jun and c-Fos has been investigated. Fifteen days after injury, the analysis in the sciatic nerves highlighted a bilateral increase of the activated forms of PKCÎ³, \{ERK\} 1,2 and SAP/JNK, whereas c-Jun showed an increase only ipsilaterally. \{ALCAR\} completely prevented mechanical hyperalgesia and provoked in the nerve a c-Jun increment only. In the lumbar tract of the spinal cord, higher levels of activated PKCÎ³, \{ERK\} 1,2, p38, SAP/JNK and c-Jun proteins were detected in the ipsilateral side in respect of sham. \{ALCAR\} was able to stimulate this expression profile. At the transcriptional level c-Jun mRNA was increased in the ipsilateral side of spinal cord of \{CCI\} saline-treated rats, whereas c-Fos mRNA was unchanged. \{ALCAR\} had a stimulatory effect on both these early genes. These findings may represent a different approach in the study of the complex balance between pain and neuroregeneration and could constitute the basis for developing new disease modifying agents in the treatment of neuropathic pain.}}

We demonstrate that ERRÎ² is transiently induced, and ERRÎ³ is dramatically induced (and accumulates) in a differentiation-dependent manner in skeletal muscle cells. Treatment of differentiated skeletal muscle cells with the ERRÎ²/Î³ agonist (GSK4716) produced a significant increase in the expression of GRÎ± (isoform D) protein. Quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis after treatment with GSK4716, revealed induction of the mRNAs encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11Î²-HSD1), the enzyme that converts inactive cortisone to cortisol and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase expression (H6PDH) that stimulates oxoreduction by 11Î²-HSD1. Candidate based expression profiling also demonstrated the mRNAs encoding characterized \{GR\} target genes, including C/EBP, ApoD and Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) are induced in \{GSK4716\} treated cells. In concordance with these observations, siRNA-mediated suppression of the mRNA encoding ERRÎ³ (but not ERRÎ± and Î²) attenuated the expression of mRNAs encoding GR, 11Î²HSD1 and \{GR\} target gene(s). Similarly, treatment with the ERRÎ³ (and ERÎ±) antagonist diethylstilbestrol (DES) suppressed glucocorticoid responsive gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. Interestingly, we observed that \{GSK4716\} trans-activated GRE-TK-LUC in a GR-dependent manner. This study highlights the regulatory crosstalk between ERRÎ³ and \{GR\} signaling in skeletal muscle cells, and suggests the ERRÎ³ agonist modulates the expression of critical genes that control \{GR\} signaling and glucocorticoid sensitive gene expression.}}

Through a comparative study of existing methods, this article puts forward a fast method to eliminate the bowtie effect using the ephemeris data. In this method, the rough positions of overlapping data are first detected. Because of the influence caused by the instrument characters and the earth's curvature, the positions of overlapping data need to be rectified to obtain more precise results. The optimal rectification method used in this article is selected by comparing three methods. By using the optimal method, the rectified \{MODIS\} data can be obtained. The experiments demonstrate that the bowtie effect can be eliminated in less than 1 s. In contrast, other traditional methods spend at least 3 s, thus the proposed method is faster and more effective.}}

Results Nucleotidic polymorphism ranged from 6.6% (US3) to 12% (UL40), with a significant proportion of missense mutations (39â€“69%), some of which could have a functional impact. Analysis of the concatenated sequence (4804 nucleotides for each strain) evidenced two clusters of sequences presenting a reticulate topology suggestive of recombination events (SplitsTree). Phi-test pointed numerous phylogenetically conflicting signals indicating a high statistical probability of recombination. The subsequent bootscan analysis was consistent with these data.

Ability of antigen-pulsed \{DCs\} to stimulate autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes and levels of TH1/TH2 cytokines were also examined using flow cytometry. Both vesicular carrier systems as antigen delivery modules and \{DCs\} as antigen-presenting cells were able to generate a protective immune response. However, ethosomes were found to have higher internalizing ability and immunogenicity in comparison with elastic liposomes. These properties of ethosomes coupled with their skin-navigating potential, make it an attractive vehicle for development of a transcutaneous vaccine against hepatitis B in preference to elastic liposomes. From the Clinical Editor Two carrier systems for more potent vaccine administration - ethosomes and elastic liposomes loaded with hepatitis B surface antigen â€“ are compared. Ethosomes demonstrated higher internalizing ability and immunogenicity. Due to their known skin-navigating potential, ethosomes may represent an attractive vehicle for development of a transcutaneous vaccine against hepatitis B.}}

Recent work revealed that modulation of cellular processes by eukaryote-like serine/threonine kinases (STKs) and phosphatases (STPs) are widespread in bacteria. During the last two years, first evidence on the role of Ser/Thr phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in Staphylococcus aureus has emerged leading to the identification of a functional \{STK\} and corresponding STP. Due to homology to known STKs/STPs in other bacterial species the kinase was designated PknB or alternatively Stk/Stk1, and the phosphatase Stp. The role of these enzymes in S. aureus has been examined by use of knock-out mutants and a kinase-overexpressing strain. These studies uncovered PknB/Stk and Stp as modulators of cell wall structure and susceptibility to cell wall-acting antibiotics such as certain Î²-lactams and tunicamycin. By utilizing transcriptional profile analysis a strong regulatory impact of PknB/Stk on the expression of genes encoding proteins which are involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, autolysis, and glutamine synthesis could be identified. Moreover, PknB/Stk is able to phosphorylate MgrA, thereby regulating activity of the efflux pump NorA. In a mouse pyelonephritis model PknB/Stk has been shown to play a role in virulence. Overall, Ser/Thr phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a common theme in regulation of cellular functions determining metabolic activity and virulence also in the major human pathogen S. aureus.}}

Comparative immunologists contributed to eliminate the idea of a static immune system in invertebrates, making necessary to re-consider the evolutive meaning of immunological memory of vertebrates. If the anticipatory immune system represents a maximally efficient immune system, why can it be observed only in vertebrates, especially in consideration that molecular hypervariability exists also in invertebrates? Using well-established theories concerning the evolution of the vertebrate immunity as theoretical basis we analyze from an Eco-immunology-based perspective why a memory-based immune system may have represented an evolutive advantage for jawed vertebrates. We hypothesize that for cold-blooded vertebrates memory represents a complimentary component that flanks the robust and fundamental innate immunity. Conversely, immunological memory has become indispensable and fully exploited in warm-blooded vertebrates, due to their stable inner environment and high metabolic rate, respectively.}}

The immunotherapeutic potential of dendritic cells (DCs) transfected with \{VSIG4\} recombinant adenovirus has not been characterized. In the present study, \{DCs\} were transfected with human \{VSIG4\} (hVSIG4) recombinant adenovirus, a novel costimulatory molecule known to be a potent inhibitor of T cell activation. Transfected \{DCs\} were cocultured with allogeneic T cells and proliferation, cytokine production and T cell activation marker expression were assessed. The results showed that T cell proliferation potential, cytokine production and activation marker expression were suppressed after coculture with hVSIG4 recombinant adenovirus-transfected DCs. These findings suggest that \{DCs\} transfected with hVSIG4 recombinant adenovirus are capable of inducing allogeneic T cell suppression, which represents an ideal strategy for manipulating the immune response to transplanation or autoimmune diseases.}}

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation and freezing survival will provide new insights into the existing relationships between living organisms and their environment, and the possibility of developing multiple biotechnological applications. In the case of plants, the use of classical genetic and new â€œomicsâ€� approaches is allowing to the identification of new elements involved in regulating the cold acclimation response. The challenge ahead is to determine temperature-perception molecules and mechanisms, to uncover new internodes of multiple responses, and to integrate the regulation not only at the transcriptome but also at proteome and metabolome levels. Attaining these goals will significantly contribute global understanding of the adaptive strategies plants have evolved to cope with hostile environmental conditions, and to the development of biotechnological strategies to improve crop tolerance to freezing and other important abiotic stresses.}}

Male C57/Black 6 mice were fed a high-fat diet, weight matched, and randomized in 4 treatment groups: vehicle, pioglitazone, telmisartan, and pioglitazone-telmisartan. Weight gain, food and water intake, body composition, plasma leptin levels, and the hypothalamic expression of neuroendocrine mediators were analyzed. Additional studies were performed with irbesartan and in angiotensin \{II\} 1A receptorâ€“knockout mice. Telmisartan abolished weight and fat gain in vehicle- and pioglitazone-treated mice while decreasing food intake, the hypothalamic expression of the agouti-related protein, and plasma leptin levels. Modifications in neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin were not consistent with changes in food intake. The effects on weight gain and expression of the agouti-related protein were intermediate with irbesartan. The effects of telmisartan on weight gain were even more pronounced in angiotensin \{II\} 1A receptorâ€“knockout mice. This study confirms the anorexigenic effects of telmisartan in mice fed a high-fat diet and suggests for the first time a functional role of telmisartan on hypothalamic orexigenic agouti-related protein regulation. These anorexigenic properties abolish both weight gain and body composition modifications in fat-fed and glitazone-treated mice. The anorexigenic properties are independent from the angiotensin \{II\} 1A receptor.}}

The \{KGraph\} allows the user to more easily investigate multicollinearity and confounding through visualization of the multidimensional correlation structure underlying genetic associations. It emphasizes geneâ€“environment interactions, geneâ€“gene interactions, and correlations, all important components of the complex genetic architecture of most human traits. The \{KGraph\} was designed for use in gene-centric studies, but can be integrated into association analysis workflows as well.

The relevancy of electricity demand in various sectors is revealed by means of electricity consumption chains (ECCs), which are key components in the IOTED. Besides, a new concept, electricity demand multiplier (EDM), is presented to identify dominant sectors imposing great impacts on electricity demand quantitatively. In order to testify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a case based on provincial economy system in China is studied. Dominant sectors are identified and discussed.}}

abstract = {There is a growing appreciation among evolutionary biologists that the rate and tempo of molecular evolution might often be altered at or near the time of speciation, i.e. that speciation is in some way a special time for genes. Molecular phylogenies frequently reveal increased rates of genetic evolution associated with speciation and other lines of investigation suggest that various types of abrupt genomic disruption can play an important role in promoting speciation via reproductive isolation. These phenomena are in conflict with the gradual view of molecular evolution that is implicit in much of our thinking about speciation and in the tools of modern biology. This raises the prospect of studying the molecular evolutionary consequences of speciation per se and studying the footprint of speciation as an active force in promoting genetic divergence. Here we discuss the reasons to believe that speciation can play such a role and elaborate on possible mechanisms for accelerated rates of evolution following speciation. We provide an example of how it is possible detect whether accelerated bursts of evolution occur in neutral and/or adaptive regions of genes and discuss the implications of rapid episodes of change for conventional models of molecular evolution. Speciation might often owe more to ephemeral and essentially arbitrary events that cause reproductive isolation than to the gradual and regular tug of natural selection that draws a species into a new niche.}}

Recent data revealed that microRNAs have an important role in pancreas and liver development and physiology. Using cloning and microarray profiling approaches, we show that a unique repertoire of microRNAs is expressed at the onset of liver and pancreas organogenesis, and in pancreas and liver at key stages of cell fate determination. Among the microRNAs that are expressed at these stages, miR-495 and miR-218 were predicted to, respectively, target the Onecut (OC) transcription factors Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor-6 (HNF-6/OC-1) and OC-2, two important regulators of liver and pancreas development. MiR-495 and miR-218 are dynamically expressed in developing liver and pancreas, and by transient transfection, we show that they target HNF-6 and OC-2 3â€²UTRs. Moreover, when overexpressed in cultured cells, miR-495 and miR-218 decrease the endogenous levels of HNF-6 and OC-2 mRNA. These results indicate that the expression of regulators of liver and pancreas development is modulated by microRNAs. They also suggest a developmental role for miR-495 and miR-218.}}

Here, by employing various approaches, we followed structural and functional modifications of these organelles at the beginning of cellular demise. In detail, we observed that C2-cer, but not \{CD95\} activation, markedly modifies the morphology of the \{ER\} and promotes Ca2+ release. Accordingly, mitochondria of C2-cer-treated, but not of CD95-stimulated, cells are fragmented, show reduced Ca2+ uptake, and collapsed membrane potential (Î”Î¨m). Most notably, C2-cer-mediated morphological aberrations of the \{ER\} are prevented neither by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADfmk nor by the cell cytoskeleton dissembler cytochalasin-D, while on the contrary they are reduced by incubation in the presence of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nâ€²,Nâ€²-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). We conclude that initiation of apoptosis via the intrinsic (i.e. C2-cer mediated) pathway causes an early structural and functional alteration of both \{ER\} and mitochondria, thus underlying a final â€œnon returnâ€� point in the apoptotic pathway.}}

These include ceramic oxide like nanostructured catalysts. \{SCS\} is an attractive alternative for the production of smart materials of high value compared to the more conventional and expensive preparation routes. \{SCS\} processes are characterized by relative medium heating oven temperatures (350â€“600Â°C), fast heating rates, short reaction times and very small residence time at high temperature. The final product is usually of high purity and well crystallized with nanometric size clusters. Furthermore, SCS, suitably adapted, is easily tunable to complex industrial supports to produce directly in situ structured catalysts. The present work deals with the analysis of low-environmental-impact premixed metal fiber burners (FeCrAlloyÂ® fiber mat) for household applications. New catalytic burners based on Pd(LaMnO3Â·2ZrO2) catalyst were developed and tested in a partially modified commercial condensing boiler test rig fed with natural gas (NG). The catalytic burner presented a lower environmental impact, compared to the commercial bare burner, mainly in terms of CO. \{NO\} emissions were reduced, too, but in a slightly lower extent. The catalytic burner better stabilized the combustion process within the porous medium, maximizing the heat fraction transferred by radiation, cooling the flame temperature and enhancing the degree of completeness of \{NG\} combustion.}}

Glial cells are central in providing for brain homeostasis. In addition, glia is intrinsically endowed with two opposing features: they protect nervous tissue, but can also rapidly assume the guise of a natural killer, trying to eliminate and seal off a damaged area so as to salvage the whole at the expense of the part.}}

Particular attention was paid to assessing the role of integration of the different components of the transport system and of the integration of transport with other economic sectors. This assessment was informed by Ray Pawsonâ€™s realist evaluation approach, with its emphasis on the inter-relationships between context, process and outcome. The context was provided by case studies covering small urban areas, large urban areas and inter-urban corridors. The three key processes identified related to a regulated system with public ownership and control, a deregulated system with private sector ownership (â€˜competition in the marketâ€™) and a system in which there was public planning of the transport system but private provision (â€˜competition for the marketâ€™). Outcomes can be assessed using cost-benefit analysis tools to determine impacts on economic welfare or more qualitative approaches can be used to determine the extent to which accessibility or sustainability goals have been achieved. The evidence provided suggests that wider public policy goals are more important for urban than for inter-urban transport and it thus in urban areas where integration should be pursued with most vigour. The most relevant process for achieving this would seem to be variants of the competition for the market model. Some policy recommendations are made and implications for further research and for future conferences assessed.}}

Pd-based catalysts were prepared by solution combustion synthesis (SCS), starting from metal nitrates/glycine mixtures. Basic characterization (XRD, BET, \{FESEM\} analysis), FTâ€“IR studies and catalytic activity tests were performed on powders and after accelerated ageing carried out up to 2 weeks (hydro-thermal treatment at 900 Â°C under a flow rate with typical domestic boiler exhaust gas composition, 9% CO2, 18% H2O, 2% \{O2\} in N2, containing also 200 ppmv of \{SO2\} to emphasize any poisoning effect).

S-hydro-thermal treatment provoked bulk and surface sulfates formation on all aged samples, with a concentration increasing with the exposure time. Prevailing ageing mechanisms seemed to be Pd metallic clusters coalescence, detected over the Ceâ€“Zr system, and surface-bulk sulfates formation, the latter destroying the initial crystallographic structure. In 2%Pd/LaMnO3Â·ZrO2 and 2%Pd/BaCeO3Â·ZrO2 powders the amount of the perovskite phase strongly decreased during ageing, in favor of the formation of bulk sulfate and of oxides.}}

The use of multiple services, possibly utilizing different technologies and different sources, has significant implications for the performance and security of these applications to support a business process effectively. Estimating performance and security in this distributed environment is a hard problem. This paper examines how performance and security measures can be developed for service-based applications. Business processes are broken down into constituent tasks and a formal mechanism is developed for deriving performance and security measures for the application. Given the competing nature of these two objectives, a tradeoff strategy is utilized wherein managers can trade improved performance for reduced security or vice versa. As the number of alternative services for each task increases, the composition problem becomes combinatorially explosive. A genetic algorithm approach is adopted to find the Pareto optimal set of services that can be assembled to support the business process. An application to a real-world business process illustrates its effectiveness.}}

In addition, clearance of tissue debris by microglia is essential for tissue homeostasis and may have a neuroprotective outcome. Since unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) has been proven to induce astroglial immunological activation and neuronal cell death, we addressed the question of whether microglia acquires a reactive phenotype when challenged by \{UCB\} and intended to characterize this response. In the present study we report that microglia primary cultures stimulated by \{UCB\} react by the acquisition of a phagocytic phenotype that shifted into an inflammatory response characterized by the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-1Î², and IL-6, upregulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 activities. Further investigation upon upstream signalling pathways revealed that \{UCB\} led to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB at an early time point, suggesting that these pathways might underlie both the phagocytic and the inflammatory phenotypes engaged by microglia. Curiously, the phagocytic and inflammatory phenotypes in UCB-activated microglia seem to alternate along time, indicating that microglia reacts towards \{UCB\} insult firstly with a phagocytic response, in an attempt to constrain the lesion extent and comprising a neuroprotective measure. Upon prolonged \{UCB\} exposure periods, either a shift on global microglia reaction occurred or there could be two distinct sub-populations of microglial cells, one directed at eliminating the damaged cells by phagocytosis, and another that engaged a more delayed inflammatory response. In conclusion, microglial cells are relevant partners to consider during bilirubin encephalopathy and the modulation of its activation might be a promising therapeutic target.}}

Target-specific variants with typically high nanomolar or low micromolar affinities (KD) could be selected successfully against both proteins, as shown by dot blot, \{ELISA\} and real-time biospecific interaction analyses. Affibody molecule variants selected against H-Ras were shown to bind epitopes overlapping each other at a site that differed from that at which H-Ras interacts with Raf-1.

Possible intracellular applications of the selected affibody molecules are discussed.}}

Clinically, \{CSCs\} are predicted to mediate tumor recurrence after chemo- and radiation-therapy due to the relative inability of these modalities to effectively target CSCs. If this is the case, then \{CSC\} must be efficiently targeted to achieve a true cure. Similarities between normal and malignant stem cells, at the levels of cell-surface proteins, molecular pathways, cell cycle quiescence, and microRNA signaling present challenges in developing CSC-specific therapeutics. Approaches to targeting \{CSCs\} include the development of agents targeting known stem cell regulatory pathways as well as unbiased high-throughput siRNA or small molecule screening. Based on studies of pathways present in normal stem cells, recent work has identified potential â€œAchilles healsâ€� of CSC, whereas unbiased screening provides opportunities to identify new pathways utilized by \{CSC\} as well as develop potential therapeutic agents.

To provide insights on their design and application, J774A.1 cells are exposed to particles with different diameters (430 nm, 1.9 Î¼m and 4.8 Î¼m), and the size effects on a series of cellular responses in macrophages are evaluated. Cellular uptake study demonstrates that nanosized particles accumulate in the cells at a faster rate, and with a higher surface area. Once the data are converted into the expression of particle volume, the maximum value is found with 1.9 Î¼m particles instead of nanoparticles. Moreover, the uptake intermediates are also trapped, and the steps of particle internalization include filopodia sensing, skeleton rearrangement, and morphology change. Subsequent cellular trafficking reveals that only nanosized particles transport via lysosomal pathway, which is consistent with their uptake mechanisms. Furthermore, nanosized particles prefer to promote the secretion of Th1-specific molecule signals (e.g. IFN, IL-12) rather than immune suppressors. All these results, along with a couple of surprises, are discussed in the view of clinical practice. They are expected, in principle, to establish the basis of new design concepts for particle-based biomedical applications.}}

abstract = {Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is the inducible isoform of the first and rate-limiting enzyme of heme degradation. Induction of HO-1 protects against the cytotoxicity of oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death. More recently, HO-1 has been recognized to have major immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, which have been demonstrated in HO-1 knockout mice and a human case of genetic HO-1 deficiency. Beneficial protective effects of HO-1 in inflammation are not only mediated via enzymatic degradation of proinflammatory free heme, but also via production of the anti-inflammatory compounds bilirubin and carbon monoxide. The immunomodulatory role of HO-1 is associated with its cell type-specific functions in myeloid cells (eg. macrophages and monocytes) and in endothelial cells, as both cell types are crucially involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This review covers the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that are involved in HO-1 gene expression. In particular, it is discussed how redox-dependent transcriptional activators such as NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), NF-ÎºB and AP-1 along with the transcription repressor \{BTB\} and \{CNC\} homologue 1 (Bach1) control the inducible HO-1 gene expression. The role of central pro- and anti-inflammatory cellular signaling cascades including p38 \{MAPK\} and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt in HO-1 regulation is highlighted. Finally, emerging strategies that apply targeted pharmacological induction of HO-1 for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory conditions are summarized.}}

abstract = {A primary response to inflammation is an increased survival of the target cell. Several pathways have been identified that promote maintenance of the cell. The principal mechanism for the extended survival is through induction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Bcl-2 was the founding member of this family with five additional members, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, Bcl-B, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1, discovered mostly in hematological malignancies. Another mechanism that could add to cell survival is the Pim kinase pathway. This family of enzymes is associated with Myc-driven transcription, cell cycle regulation, degradation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and protein translation. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia serves as an optimal model to understand the mechanism by which these two protein families provide survival advantage to cells. In addition, since this malignancy is known to be maintained by microenvironment milieu, this further adds advantage to investigate mechanisms by which these pro-survival proteins are induced in the presence of stromal support. Multiple mechanisms exists that result in increase in transcript and protein level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Following these inductions, post-translational modifications occur resulting in increased stability of pro-survival proteins, while Pim-mediated phosphorylation inhibits pro-apoptotic protein activity. Furthermore, there is a cross-talk between these two (Bcl-2 family proteins and Pim family proteins) pathways that co-operate with each other for \{CLL\} cell survival and maintenance. Vigorous efforts are being made to create small molecules that affect these proteins directly or indirectly. Several of these pharmacological inhibitors are in early clinical trials for patients with hematological malignancies.}}

We argue that characterization of the development of brain systems (e.g., the default mode network) should be comprehensive, considering not only relationships within a given system, but also how these relationships are situated within wider network contexts. We note that, despite substantial reorganization of functional connectivity, several large-scale network properties appear to be preserved across development, suggesting that functional brain networks, even in children, are organized in manners similar to other complex systems.}}

Next, we formulate the problem of global asymptotic synchronization of the sampled-data masterâ€“slave chaotic system as equivalent to the states of a corresponding error system asymptotically converging to zero for arbitrary initial conditions. We begin by developing a pulse-based intermittent control strategy for chaos synchronization. Using the discrete-time Lyapunov stability theory and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework, we construct a state feedback periodic pulse control law which yields global asymptotic synchronization of the sampled-data masterâ€“slave chaotic system for arbitrary initial conditions. We obtain a continuously coupled sampled-data feedback control law as a special case of the pulse-based feedback control. Finally, we provide experimental validation of our results by implementing, on a set of microcontrollers endowed with \{RF\} communication capability, a sampled-data masterâ€“slave chaotic system based on Chuaâ€™s circuit.}}

While the increase in kcat is temperature-independent, the increase in stability shows that the resultant interactions of this mutation have a strong enthalpic component. Thermal dependence of stability, kcat, \{KM\} and kcat/KM were analysed to gain insight on the structural effects of mutations on BplA.

Multiple myelomas expressed \{NOTCH1\} in 92.31% (72/78) and \{JAGGED1\} in 92.21% (71/77) cases. \{NOTCH1\} staining was strong in the majority of cases (59.7%), whereas \{JAGGED1\} was predominately weak (67.6% of cases). In contrast, both markers were negative in all monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance cases. However, upon progression of disease from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to multiple myeloma (seen in 4 patients), analysis of the subsequent bone marrow biopsy showed weak expression of both markers in tumorous plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry results were compared with the pattern of bone marrow infiltration, plasma cell differentiation, and the presence of t(11;14)(q13,q32), t(14;16)(q32;q23),and t(4;14)(p16.3;q23) and overall survival in multiple myeloma patients. A significant correlation was found between strong \{NOTCH1\} staining in multiple myeloma plasma cells and the diffuse type of bone marrow infiltration (P = .002) and an immature morphologic type of plasma cells (P = .043). After a median follow-up of 20.3 months, in multiple myeloma patients no difference in overall survival between \{NOTCH1\} (P = .484) and \{JAGGED1\} (P = .822) positive and negative cases were found. In conclusion, our results indicate importance of \{NOTCH1\} and \{JAGGED1\} expression in plasma cell neoplasia and a possible diagnostic value of their immunohistochemical evaluation of bone marrow infiltrates for multiple myeloma.}}

An empirical study was conducted to measure the performance of the suppliers in three different key performance indicators of the outsourcing and supplierâ€™s performance to arise the existing problems via information exchange, data collection and data analysis. It was found that supplier development through data and information exchange and better communication by any food distribution \{SME\} raises the problems more promptly. This can dramatically change the supplierâ€™s behavior to improve the quality of the supplierâ€™s service and products. It is suggested that more research is required to raise other key performance indicators and their related problems and to develop more improvement practices. Six sigma methodologies could be the potential good practices to be focused in future research studies. Supplier performance measurement, which encompasses data exchange and data collection, develops the systematic flow of information, which potentially improves the flow of goods and the whole food supply chain to address the final consumer satisfaction. The research took a novel approach in adopting some transport related key performance indicators of the food supply to the food distribution and retailing sector, which is almost a new approach in food industry.}}

Determining the etiology of genetic and/or environmentally-induced high blood pressure has been difficult because of the many interacting systems involved. Two main pathways have been implicated as principal determinants of blood pressure since they are located in the kidney (the key organ responsible for blood pressure regulation), and have profound effects on sodium balance: the dopaminergic and reninâ€“angiotensin systems. These systems counteract or modulate each other, in concert with a host of intracellular second messenger pathways to regulate sodium and water balance. In particular, the G protein-coupled receptor kinase type 4 (GRK4) appears to play a key role in regulating dopaminergic-mediated natriuresis. Constitutively activated \{GRK4\} gene variants (R65L, A142V, and A486V), by themselves or by their interaction with other genes involved in blood pressure regulation, are associated with essential hypertension and/or salt-sensitive hypertension in several ethnic groups. GRK4Î³ ï€ 142Vï€ transgenic mice are hypertensive on normal salt intake while GRK4Î³ï€  486Vï€  transgenic mice develop hypertension only with an increase in salt intake. \{GRK4\} gene variants have been shown to hyperphosphorylate, desensitize, and internalize two members of the dopamine receptor family, the \{D1\} (D1R) and \{D3\} (D3R) dopamine receptors, but also increase the expression of a key receptor of the reninâ€“angiotensin system, the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R). Knowledge of the numerous blood pressure regulatory pathways involving angiotensin and dopamine may provide new therapeutic approaches to the pharmacological regulation of sodium excretion and ultimately blood pressure control.}}

A total of 111 post-puberty adolescents, with a \{BMI\} &gt;95th percentile, were included. Glycemia and lipid profiles were analyzed. Insulin resistance was estimated by HOMA-IR. Cytokine concentrations were measured by ELISA. The results are presented according to quartiles of weight loss: 1st (&lt;2.5 kg) = low; 2nd (2.5â€“8 kg) = low to moderate; 3rd (8â€“14 kg) = moderate; and 4th (&gt;14 kg) = massive. The most important finding was that the \{NPY\} concentration increased significantly only in the first phase of weight loss. Moreover, Î±-MSH variation was an independent factor in explaining the \{NPY\} changes during the intervention, confirming the role of the Î±-MSH concentration in the peripheral control of energy balance in obese adolescents. Indeed, \{BMI\} reduction was correlated with increased Î±-MSH (p &lt; 0.05). Massive weight loss promoted a significant increase in Î±-MSH concentration, and hyperleptinemia was reduced after intervention. All together, our findings, which contribute to our understanding of how orexigenic and anorexigenic systems are regulated by weight loss, will provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of obesity and other metabolic diseases, especially in obese adolescents.}}

Three members of this gene family, Ly108, Ly9, and CD84, exhibit polymorphisms that strongly influence susceptibility to systemic autoimmunity, notably in mice, but also in some human populations. Polymorphisms of Ly108 in mice strongly impact central tolerance in both B and T cell development, predominantly by modulating apoptosis, anergy, and cell-cycle progression. In addition, Ly108 and CD84, together with their downstream signaling adaptor SLAM-associated protein (SAP), have emerged as key players in Bâ€“T interactions during the formation of germinal centers. Interestingly, several independent lines of research have now associated variations in Bâ€“T interactions during germinal center formation with systemic autoimmunity, suggesting that susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may involve in part the impairment of this peripheral tolerance checkpoint. These new insights into the multiplicity of roles played by the SLAM/CD2 family and its potential importance in human autoimmunity positions the SLAM/CD2 family as an excellent target for immunotherapy.}}

The biophysical similarities and differences between membrane fusion and fission become more evident if we disregard the accompanying biological processes and consider only remodeling of the lipid bilayer. The forces that determine the bilayer propensity to undergo fusion or fission come from proteins and in most cases from membrane-bound proteins. In this review, we consider the mechanistic principles underlying the fusion and fission reactions and discuss the current hypotheses on how specific proteins act in the two types of membrane remodeling.}}

The framework provides a systematic way of unifying numerous lines of research, which have linked a wide array of factors to the functioning of children with LI. The result is an integrated account of \{LI\} where children's functioning emerges from the complex interaction of core linguistic processes, the ability to use them in social interactions, and a variety of environmental and personal factors. This account is well-suited to the clinical context because it focuses clinical attention on how such factors may be interacting to maintain a child's functional limitations, and on how they might work together to facilitate optimal everyday functioning, the ultimate goal of intervention. In this paper, the ICF's conceptual framework is described, and the nature of the relationships among its components explained. We explore how the integrated view of \{LI\} inspired by this conceptual framework differs from the prevailing impairment-driven account, provide examples from the literature that are consistent with the former view, and discuss its implications for clinical decision-making. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, the reader will be able to: (1) describe the nature of the relationships that exist among components of the ICF; (2) describe how interactions among components may shape the functioning of children with LI; (3) identify ways in which the integrated account of \{LI\} engendered by the \{ICF\} may improve clinical service.}}

In this study an X-ray Î¼CT technique was developed to allow for anatomical study of the overwintering corms of Eriophorum vaginatum, an ecologically important sedge species in arctic tussock-tundra and boreal peatlands. Using a \{GE\} Medical MS8X-130 X-ray Î¼CT scanner, optimal imaging parameters included scanning isolated corms at 80 kVp and 100 Î¼A with a 3500 ms exposure time and an isotropic voxel size of 10 Î¼m. A Gaussian blur image filter with a blur radius (Ïƒ) of two pixels was applied to the optimal dataset to improve visual detection and contrast of tissues while removing 99.2% of image noise. Using the developed X-ray Î¼CT technique several undocumented anatomical characteristics of the corm were identified including the vascular connection between a parent corm and branching cormel and the 3D shape of sclereid clusters. The 3D structure of sclereid clusters was determined whereby the perimeter of their lance shape is greatly reinforced by sclereids with thicker secondary cell walls as compared to those of the interior of the cluster. The structure of sclereid clusters and their association with leaf traces suggests they may be stabilizing the corm-leaf connection to protect vascular tissues from physical damage. The proposed X-ray Î¼CT technique is an excellent tool for determination of the 3D structure of E. vaginatum corms and may be used to detect alterations in tissue structure and chemistry in response to environmental change in this and other Cyperaceous species.}}

In this work, we demonstrate a simple approach of displacing suspended matter within such chambers by depressing one side of the cover-slip using piezoelectric translators to create a squeeze flow to move particles and to restore them close to their original position when translation ceased. In the system developed, the application of 60 V to a piezoelectric stack caused 60 Î¼m of displacement. The transfer coefficient governing this ratio is largely dependent on the support stiffness in which we estimate here as k = 22,000 N/m. This value can be easily raised if required. The approach was also adapted to transfer particles and fluid between two cover-slip chambers sealed at all the edges except for a small air gap. During actuation, a liquid bridge was established between the two chambers to allow such transfer to occur. These findings constitute the first known successful attempt to use squeeze flow to manipulate particles.}}

We assessed lymphocyte and bone marrow (BM) progenitor cell phenotype and differentiation capacity, spontaneous \{BM\} cytokine production, stromal cells, and stromal cell interleukin (IL)-7 production. A reduced clonogenic capability manifested at day +20. Patients had significantly lower CD4+ T cells versus controls, mainly in the CD45RA+CD62L+ subset. \{NKs\} were among the first lymphocytes to repopulate the peripheral blood. At day +60, an increase in primitive \{BM\} progenitor cells paralleled small increases in CD4+, naÃ¯ve CD4+, and thymic naÃ¯ve Th cells. A significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ markers paralleled an increase in CD3âˆ’CD16+ NKs, especially with full engraftment. In patients with stable mixed chimerism we observed very low levels of CD3+ donor chimerism early after transplant that increased over time, but a stable population of high donor \{NK\} cells, suggesting a role of these cells on donor engraftment. Stromal cells secreted less IL-7 and displayed â€œmacrophage-likeâ€� morphology. Patients initially manifested impaired stem/progenitor cell growth and differentiation capacity in parallel with altered T cell homeostasis and a reduced T cell naÃ¯ve compartment. We hypothesize that T cell compartment damage partly arises from altered new T cell production from the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells under stromal cytokine influence. \{NNK\} subset analysis might be useful for determining transplant outcome.}}

CD34+ cells were cultured for 12 and 40 h in liquid cultures with supplemented media favoring myeloid or erythroid commitment. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was employed to generate four independent libraries. By analyzing the differentially expressed regulated transcripts between the un-stimulated and the stimulated CD34+ cells, we observed a set of genes that was initially up-regulated at 12 h but were then down-regulated at 40 h, exclusively after myeloid stimulus. Among those we found transcripts for NFKB2, RELB, IL1B, LTB, LTBR, TNFRSF4, TGFB1, and IKBKA. Also, the inhibitor \{NFKBIA\} (IKBA) was more expressed at 12 h. All those transcripts code for signaling proteins of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway. \{NFKB2\} is a subunit of the NF-ÎºB transcription factor that with \{RELB\} mediates the non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathway. Interference \{RNA\} (RNAi) against NFKB1, \{NFKB2\} and control \{RNAi\} were transfected into bone marrow CD34+HSPC. The percentage and the size of the myeloid colonies derived from the CD34+ cells decreased after inhibition of NFKB2.

abstract = {The Notch pathway regulates the renewal and fate decisions of stem cells in multiple tissues. Notch1, -2, as well as the Notch target gene Hes1 are expressed in the putative stem cells in the continuously growing mouse incisors, but so far there has not been any evidence for a function of the Notch pathway in the regulation of the incisor stem cells. We have analysed the effects of the Notch pathway inhibitor \{DAPT\} on the maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation of the epithelial stem cells in explant cultures of the mouse incisor. The proximal part of the incisor containing the cervical loop stem cell niche was dissected from newborn mice and cultured for 2â€“6 days in vitro. \{DAPT\} inhibited the expression of Notch target gene Hes1 in the cervical loop indicating that Notch signalling was inhibited in the putative stem cells. The most striking effect of \{DAPT\} was a significant reduction in the size of the cervical loop. \{DAPT\} caused a marked but partially reversible decrease in cell proliferation, as well as massive apoptosis in the epithelial stem cell niche. Interestingly, restricted apoptosis was detected within the Notch expressing putative stem cells also in the control cultures as well as in incisors in vivo, suggesting that apoptosis may be a mechanism regulating the size of the epithelial stem cell pool in the incisor. The differentiation of the epithelial cells into enamel-forming ameloblasts was not affected by \{DAPT\} but the number of preameloblasts was progressively decreased during culture period reflecting the depletion of stem and progenitor cells. Our results indicate that Notch signalling is required for epithelial stem cell survival and enamel formation in the continuously growing mouse incisor.}}

Ecological complexity has been linked to concepts such as ecological integrity, diversity and resilience and has been put forth as a candidate ecological orientor. In this article, the concept of complexity as a system attribute is presented and candidate measures of ecological complexity are reviewed. The measures are distinguished by their ability to characterize the spatial, temporal, structural or spatiotemporal signatures of an ecosystem. Many of these measures have been adapted from disciplines such as physics and information theory that have a long history of quantifying complexity, however more work needs to be done to develop techniques adapted to ecological data. It is argued that if appropriate measures are developed and validated for ecosystems, ecological complexity could become a key ecological indicator.}}

Giardia lamblia, Giardia intestinalis), is a flagellated, binucleated protozoan parasite which infects a wide array of mammalian hosts (Adam, 2001). The symptoms of giardiasis include abdominal cramps, nausea, and acute or chronic diarrhea, with malabsorption and failure of children to thrive occurring in both sub-clinical and symptomatic disease (Thompson et al., 1993). Infections are transmitted by cysts which are excreted in the feces of infected humans and animals. Human giardiasis is distributed worldwide, with rates of detection between 2â€“5% in the developed world and 20â€“30% in the developing nations (Farthing, 1994). There is significant variation in the outcome of Giardia infections. Most infections are self-limiting, although re-infection is common in endemic areas and chronic infections also occur. Moreover, some individuals suffer from severe cramps, nausea and diarrhea while others escape these overt symptoms. This review will describe recent advances in parasite genetics and host immunity that are helping to shed light on this variability.}}

Therefore, the present study was designed to characterize the members of \{TNFAIP8\} family in the kidney and to explore their possible roles in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. By RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, we found that all members of \{TNFAIP8\} family were detected in the kidney. \{TNFAIP8\} and \{TIPE2\} expression was significantly increased in glomeruli from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, and this upregulation was further confirmed in renal biopsies of diabetic patients. In in vitro study, \{TNFAIP8\} was upregulated in response to high glucose in mesangial cells rather than podocytes. Moreover, a direct correlation was observed between expression of \{TNFAIP8\} and mesangial cell proliferation and this regulation was associated with \{NADPH\} oxidase-mediated signaling pathway. However, we failed to observe the upregulation of \{TIPE2\} in both mesangial cells and podocytes in response to high glucose. In conclusion, the present study addressed the role of \{TNFAIP8\} family in diabetic nephropathy. These findings for the first time demonstrate that \{TNFAIP8\} is one of critical components of a signal transduction pathway that links mesangial cell proliferation to diabetic renal injury.}}

In this configuration, the \{SOFC\} is fed by natural gas and provides electricity and heat to the SOEC, which carries out the separation of steam into hydrogen and oxygen. Depending on the system layout considered, the oxygen available at the \{SOEC\} anode outlet can be either mixed with the \{SOFC\} cathode stream in order to improve the \{SOFC\} performance or regarded as a co-product. Two configurations of the cell stack are studied. The first consists of a stack with the same number of \{SOFCs\} and \{SOECs\} working at the same current density. In this case, since in typical operating conditions the voltage delivered by the \{SOFC\} is lower than the one required by the SOEC, the required additional power is supplied by means of an electric grid connection. In the second case, the electricity balance is compensated by providing additional \{SOFCs\} to the stack, which are fed by a supplementary natural gas feed. Simulations carried out with Aspen Plus show that pure hydrogen can be produced with a natural gas to hydrogen LHV-efficiency that is about twice the value of a typical water electrolyzer and comparable to that of medium-scale reformers.}}

Occludin1, claudin5, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were analyzed at 72 h post-pMCAO with Western blots. \{BBB\} permeability was measured by Evans blue extravasation and infarct size was evaluated by cresyl violet at 72 h after pMCAO. Ischemic injury significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the expression of MMP-9, MMP-2, TNF-Î± and IL-6, and reduced the levels of occludin1 and claudin5. These changes were followed by increased infarct size (% contralateral hemisphere) and Evans blue extravasation into the brain indicating compromise of the BBB. \{PROG\} and \{ALLO\} attenuated \{BBB\} disruption and infarct size following pMCAO by reducing \{MMPs\} and the inflammatory response and by preventing the degradation of occludin1 and claudin5. We conclude that \{PROG\} and \{ALLO\} can help to protect \{BBB\} disruption following pMCAO.}}

Prenatal \{RA\} exposure reduced fetal body weight, length and skeletal ossification of the hindlimb compared with the control fetuses in a dose-dependent manner. The normal development curves indicated that the RA-exposed fetuses showed delayed increase in body weight and skeletal ossification development. However, there was no uniform effect on the skeletons of the hindlimb, not least retardation in ossification and induction malformation on the talus and calcaneus. Our results demonstrated that prenatal \{RA\} exposure had retardation effects on the developing hindlimb skeleton that was independent of those on the overall fetal growth. The normal skeletal ossification showed that the talus and calcaneus were poorly ossified and they were delayed by almost one day in the \{RA\} 120 mg/kg group. Therefore, during the susceptible stages, different regions of the limb bud responded differently to the teratogenic effects of RA.}}

This paper discusses the identification of leakage flows that are applicable to the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (Pty) Ltd. (PBMR) design and the ranking of these leakage flows. The modeling methodology and results are also discussed. Similar to previous HTR's, it was found that leakage and bypass flows are important parameters to consider for safe and efficient operation of the PBMR. Through a focused approach, it is shown that \{PBMR\} is able to improve the understanding of this phenomenon and quantify the flows and subsequent influence on the operation of the system. This has resulted in a reduction of leakage and bypass from approximately 46% to 20%. The improved understanding of leakage and bypass flows allows \{PBMR\} to address this issue during the design phase of the project, which subsequently results in a vast improvement over historical \{HTR\} designs. This gives \{PBMR\} a distinct advantage over previous High Temperature Reactors.}}

Partial gene sequences of the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were isolated from the native Chilean strawberry fruits, and used to design gene-specific primers in order to perform transcriptional analyses by qRT-PCR. These genes showed spatial, developmental, and genotypic associated patterns. The red fruit of f. patagonica exhibited higher transcript levels of anthocyanin-related genes and higher levels of anthocyanins compared to the barely pigmented fruit of f. chiloensis. The anthocyanin accumulation in F. chiloensis ssp. chiloensis fruits was concomitant with the particular progress of the transcriptional activity of genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoid pigments.

During both hypoxia and hypercapnia, \{ATP\} and possibly other gliotransmitters released in the ventral medulla seemed to enhance cardiorespiratory responses to these stressors, and some of this \{ATP\} was proposed to be derived from astrocytes. Astrocytes also play a vital role controlling local blood flow. Astrocytes are activated by neurotransmitter release â€“ especially glutamate and ATP. The astrocytic activation is manifest as a rise in intracellular Ca2+ that is closely coupled to the metabolic activity of neurons in the active area. The activation of astrocytes spreads as a wave from astrocyte to astrocyte and causes release of ATP, adenosine, and other gliotransmitters that may alter neuronal function in the region of astrocytic activation. In addition, ATP, adenosine and other vasoactive substances, when released at the endfeet of astrocytes, interact with vascular receptors that may either dilate or constrict the vessels in the region closely adjacent to the site of neuronal activity. Thus, astrocytes seem to integrate neuronal metabolic needs by responding to the level of neuronal activity to regulate local blood flow and cardiorespiratory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia to match substrate need (oxygen and glucose) with substrate availability and with the removal of CO2. In so doing, astrocytes assume a larger role in information processing and in the regulation of neuronal activity and homeostasis of the entire organism than has been ascribed to them in the past.}}

In particular, we are interested in whether, and how, gastrointestinal peptide alterations following surgery interfere with appetite/satiety, and what role they might play in the resolution of comorbidities. Research methods and procedure PubMed/MEDLINE and \{ISI\} Web of Knowledge were used to search for human studies concerning gut peptides profiles after any bariatric operation technique. Results Most of the studies reviewed had longitudinal design, short follow-up, and low statistical power. The diversity of study results may be partially explained by methodological aspects. Glucagon-like peptide-1, gastric inhibitory peptide, and peptide \{YY\} alterations may contribute to the excellent results in glycemic control of diabetics. Results do vary depending on bariatric operation technique; this is particularly evident in the case of ghrelin, which has been much studied in recent years. Ghrelin suppression has been linked to increased satiety, alterations in energy homeostasis, and better glucose metabolism. Conclusions There is a lack of long-term data on gastrointestinal hormone profiles after bariatric surgery and the studies have many methodological pitfalls. We still need prospective, long-term, good methodological studies in this area.}}

Induction of protective immune response in wild type pups resulted in the prompt control of infection with an attenuated âˆ†actA mutant Listeria monocytogenes, accompanied by enhanced hepatic expression of mRNA for IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and IL-10. Conversely, the lack of \{TNFR1\} signalling in \{TNFR1KO\} neonatal mice resulted in substantial changes in the profile of inflammatory mediators and ultimately fatal outcome of the infected pups. Despite remarkable increase in indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA detected in the liver of \{TNFR1KO\} mice, bacterial proliferation was unrestrained. Increased mRNA expression of IDO, iNOS, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, MCP-1, and MIP-1Î± was found in the spleens of infected \{KO\} mice, and in the brains mRNA encoding iNOS, IDO, IFN-Î³, IL-12p40, IL-10, and \{RANTES\} was also upregulated. Large necrotic lesions consisting of granulocytes and macrophages were scattered throughout the liver of these mice. \{TNFR1KO\} neonates were unable to clear neutrophils and switch from the innate immune response to a specific reaction mediated by T cells. These results prove that TNF-Î± signalling is crucial and irreplaceable in antilisterial protection during the neonatal period.}}

The structure of \{FWNN\} is based on the basis of fuzzy rules including wavelet functions in the consequent parts of rules. In order to improve the function approximation accuracy and general capability of the \{FWNN\} system, an efficient genetic algorithm (GA) approach is used to adjust the parameters of dilation, translation, weights, and membership functions. By minimizing a quadratic measure of the error derived from the output of the system, the design problem can be characterized by the proposed \{GA\} formulation. Moreover, the solution is directly obtained without any need for complicated computations. The performance of our approximation is superior to that of existing methods. Several numerical design examples are likewise presented to demonstrate the design flexibility and usefulness of this presented approach.}}

However, the impact of Treg on infectious immunity after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is still unclear. Immunocompetence against opportunistic viral infections depends on the kinetics of T cell recovery after \{BMT\} through two distinctive processes, i.e. lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) of mature T cells and generation of T cells through thymopoiesis. Methods In this study, we set out to assess the effects of adoptively transferred Treg on T cell regeneration in a homeostatic peripheral T cell expansion model and a thymopoiesis-dependent \{BMT\} model, and on murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) clearance and mortality following mCMV challenge. Results Using lymphopenic Rag-2âˆ’/âˆ’Î³câˆ’/âˆ’ mice that received a limited number of congenic T cells, we demonstrate that adoptively transferred Treg abrogate \{LIP\} of T cells. mCMV challenge resulted in a rapid increase of viral load and death in mice that received Treg, but not in controls. In contrast, following syngeneic T cell-depleted \{BMT\} in Rag-2âˆ’/âˆ’Î³câˆ’/âˆ’ mice, adoptively transferred Treg did not delay T cell reconstitution nor suppressed thymic output and had no effect on viral clearance and survival following mCMV-challenge. Conclusion The effect of Treg on T cell-mediated immunocompetence against mCMV early after \{BMT\} depends on the relative contribution of peripheral expansion and thymopoiesis to T cell regeneration.}}

In seeds of angiosperms, they can act as a reserve of carbon and energy allowing to fuel post-germinative seedling growth until photosynthesis becomes effective. They also constitute the economic value of seeds in many crops. In the past years, extensive tools allowing the molecular dissection of plant metabolism have been developed together with analytical and cytological procedures adapted for seed material. These tools have allowed gaining a comprehensive overview of the metabolic pathways leading to \{TAG\} synthesis. They have also unravelled factors limiting oil production such as metabolic bottlenecks and light or oxygen availability in seed tissues. Beyond these physiological aspects, accumulation of \{TAGs\} is developmentally regulated in seeds. The oil biosynthetic process is initiated at the onset of the maturation phase, once embryo morphogenesis is achieved. A wealth of recent studies has shed new lights on the intricate regulatory network controlling the seed maturation phase, including reserve deposition. This network involves a set of regulated transcription factors that crosstalk with physiological signaling. The knowledge thus acquired paves the way for the genetic engineering of oilseed crops dedicated to food applications or green chemistry.}}

Both Cel12A and Cel5A were able to hydrolyze cellulose CMC-Na and mixed-linkage Î²-glucan. In contrast to Cel5A, Cel12A could also hydrolyze xyloglucan and induce wall extension of cucumber hypocotyls in an in vitro assay. Combining Î±-expansin, even at high concentrations, with Cel12A did not enhance the maximum/final wall extension rate induced by Cel12A alone. These results strongly suggest that modification/degradation of the xyloglucan molecule/network is the key for cell wall extension, and Î±-expansin and Cel12A may share the same acting site in the substrate. Pectinase (Pel1, a pectin lyase) enhanced Î±-expansin-induced wall extension in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the pectin network may normally regulate accessibility of expansin to the xyloglucanâ€“cellulose complex. Î±-Expansin enhanced Cel12A's hydrolytic activity on cellulose CMC-Na but not on xyloglucan and Î²-glucan. Expansin did not affect Cel5A's hydrolytic activity. Interestingly, expansin also enhanced Pel1's activity on degrading high esterified pectin. A potential explanation for why expansin could synergistically interact with only certain enzymes on specific polysaccharides is discussed. Additional results also suggested that cell wall swelling may not be a significant event during the action of expansin and hydrolases.}}

Morphology of these colloidal nanoparticles used as building blocks transformed from truncated rhombohedra, hexagon to pseudo-hexagon by altering reaction time and surfactants. By further observation using HRTEM, these nanoparticles were confirmed to grow along the c-axis. It was found that the molecular structures of surfactants make great influence on the transformation of bonding modes between carboxyl and iron atom on the surface. Then crystal growth rate was changed. It led to two opposite growth trends along the c-axis. More interestingly, the chains formed by these colloidal nanoparticles were also assembled along the c-axis. Meanwhile, configuration diversity seemed related to the morphological anisotropy along the c-axis. It was believed that two main forces between the nanoparticles were responsible for the various configurations, magnetic dipoleâ€“dipole and exchange-coupling interaction. The morphological anisotropy was considered to play a key role in the coordination of the two interactions which led to different complex structures by self-assembly. Discussion was taken to explain the formation of these interesting configurations.}}

A constant current of microampere magnitude is applied across the current electrodes of the four-electrode device, and the voltage responses between the detection probes are directly picked up by a high input impedance instrumentation amplifier. The ion-exchange membranes, which separate the detection chamber from the electrolysis chambers, enable the measurement of solution resistance free of the interference of electrolysis by-products. Two resin beds in the detection chamber serve as ion conductors while reduce the dead volume of the detector. Recycled detection effluent supplies water for the electrolysis reactions at the current electrodes to sustain constant current in solution. The porous detection probes provide microchannel for the flowing solution while indicating signals. Owing to the constant current excitation, the electronics setup becomes simple. The cell configuration, operating principle, electronics, and error analysis of this detection mode are discussed along with their use for suppressed anion chromatography.

The porous monoliths were synthesized within silica capillaries from glycidyl methacrylate and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate precursors, providing a tortuous pore structure with high surface area for the immobilization of antibodies or other biosensing ligands. The unique morphology of the monolith ensures efficient mass transport and interactions between solvated analyte molecules and covalently immobilize antibodies anchored to the monolith surface, resulting in rapid immunorecognition. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a direct immunoassay model using anti-IgG as a monolith-bound capture antibody and fluorescein-labeled IgG as an antigen. In situ antigen measurements exhibited a linear response over a concentration range between 0.1 and 50 ng/mL with 5 min assay times, while controllable injection of 1 Î¼L volumes of antigen through the monolith elements yielded a mass detection limit of 100 pg (âˆ¼700 amol). These results suggest that porous monolith supports represent a flexible and promising material for the fabrication of rapid and sensitive immunosensors suitable for integration into capillary or microfluidic devices.}}

abstract = {That regulatory evolution is important in generating phenotypic diversity was suggested soon after the discovery of gene regulation. In the past few decades, studies in animals have provided a number of examples in which phenotypic changes can be traced back to specific alterations in transcriptional regulation. Recent advances in \{DNA\} sequencing technology and functional genomics have stimulated a new wave of investigation in simple model organisms. In particular, several genome-wide comparative analyses of transcriptional circuits across different yeast species have been performed. These studies have revealed that transcription networks are remarkably plastic: large scale rewiring in which target genes move in and out of regulons through changes in cis-regulatory sequences appears to be a general phenomenon. Transcription factor substitution and the formation of new combinatorial interactions are also important contributors to the rewiring. In several cases, a transition through intermediates with redundant regulatory programs has been suggested as a mechanism through which rewiring can occur without a loss in fitness. Because the basic features of transcriptional regulation are deeply conserved, we speculate that large scale rewiring may underlie the evolution of complex phenotypes in multi-cellular organisms; if so, such rewiring may leave traceable changes in the genome from which the genetic basis of functional innovation can be detected.}}

In addition, increases in angiotensin-II-derived reactive oxygen species found in some autonomic regulatory brain areas have been implicated in hypertension. However, a link between oxidative stress and peripheral chemoreflex integration within the \{RVLM\} has never been investigated. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the pressor response induced by peripheral chemoreflex activation involves the angiotensin-II/AT1R/superoxide pathway within the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Seventeen male Wistar rats (260â€“300 g) were implanted with bilateral guide cannulae towards the \{RVLM\} and were fitted with catheters for blood pressure recordings and drug administration. Peripheral chemoreflex activation with potassium cyanide (80 Î¼g/kg, i.v.) produced a transient increase in blood pressure, which was attenuated 2 minutes after bilateral microinjection of losartan (1 nmol), an \{AT1\} receptor antagonist, in the \{RVLM\} (+ 54 Â± 4 vs + 19 Â± 3 Î”mm Hg, P &lt; 0.05, n = 6). Moreover, superoxide scavenging in the \{RVLM\} using a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, Tempol (5 nmol), significantly blunted the pressor response to peripheral chemoreflex activation (+ 50 Â± 3 vs + 18 Â± 3 Î”mm Hg, P &lt; 0.05, n = 7). On the other hand, bilateral microinjection of saline (n = 4) in the \{RVLM\} produced no change in the pressor response to chemoreflex activation. Taken together, these data suggest that the neurotransmission of the peripheral chemoreflex within the \{RVLM\} involves, at least in part, the activation of \{AT1\} receptors and downstream superoxide formation.}}

In this mini-review, we summarize the present knowledge about the deduced transcriptional regulatory repertoire of C. glutamicum and the current status of transcriptional regulatory network reconstruction with regard to the genome-wide detection of transcriptional regulations, coregulatory interactions and hierarchical cross-regulations. Moreover, we provide an overview of those regulators and their transcriptional regulations controlling genes involved in the conversion of the carbon sources glucose, fructose and sucrose into the industrially relevant products l-lysine and l-glutamate. This data will contribute to our understanding of l-lysine and l-glutamate production by C. glutamicum from the perspective of systems biology and may provide the basis for computational modeling of the respective biotechnologically important metabolic pathways.}}

Two case studies, Cases A and B, are considered in this paper and for these linear programming (LP), nonlinear programming (NLP), mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models are developed. The results predicted using these models are compared to select the best network. The optimized network for Case A consumes 20.9% less hydrogen, whereas, for Case B it is reduced by 32.3%.}}

Increase in the cell surface density of the PAC1-R following transfection with PAC1-R expression vectors significantly increased gonadotropin LHÎ² and FSHÎ² subunit promoter activities following 100 nM \{PACAP\} stimulation. In addition, increasing concentrations of \{PACAP\} stimulation augmented the promoter activities for both LHÎ² and FSHÎ² in PAC-1R overexpressing cells. In the cells with PAC1-R, the effect of GnRH was further potentiated in the presence of \{PACAP\} from 5.31 Â± 0.93 to 9.89 Â± 0.38-fold for LHÎ² and for FSHÎ² subunit, respectively; from 2.58 Â± 0.31-fold by GnRH alone to 10.90 Â± 2.79-fold with PACAP. The combination treatment with GnRH and \{PACAP\} did not augment the \{ERK\} phosphorylation induced by GnRH alone. \{PACAP\} expectedly increased cAMP accumulation and this effect was significantly attenuated in the presence of GnRH. \{PACAP\} gene expression was more prominent following lower frequency GnRH pulses (every 120 min) in a perifused culture. Our results suggest that \{PACAP\} and PAC1-R are produced locally within the gonadotrophs following GnRH stimulation. They subsequently affect the gonadotrophs in an autocrine manner and modulate the GnRH pulse-dependent specific regulation of gonadotropin subunits.}}

Clinical trial data suggest that in patients with coronary artery disease, an elevated heart rate identifies those at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and that lowering of heart rate may reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with an elevated heart rate and symptom-limiting angina. These results suggest that an increased heart rate may have an adverse impact on the atherosclerotic process and increase the risk of a cardiovascular event in patients with coronary artery disease. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms that link heart rate and cardiovascular outcomes have yet to be defined. Possibilities may include indirect mechanisms related to autonomic dysregulation and those due to an increase in heart rate per se, which can increase the ischaemic burden and exert local haemodynamic forces that can adversely impact on the endothelium and arterial wall. For these reasons, heart rate should be considered as a therapeutic target in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease.}}

Two individuals with \{ANS\} read passages out loud in each of these conditions. Results differed from those typically reported for individuals with \{PDS\} and, instead, showed (a) only a small amount of adaptation during repeated readings, (b) a small improvement for choral reading that never reached nearly fluent speech, and (c) an increase, rather than decrease, in dysfluency in the conditions with altered auditory feedback.

Recently, we described its antifibrotic potential and showed nHuIFN-Î± to have a greater effect than that of recombinant human IFN-Î± (rHuIFN-Î±). We hypothesized that cooperation between different cytokines in the nHuIFN-Î± preparation is essential for this effect. Considerable concentrations of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and platelet-derived growth factor \{AB\} (PDGF-AB) are present in the nHuIFN-Î± preparations. Methods We tested the viability and the expression of procollagen type I messenger \{RNA\} (mRNA) in \{MRC5\} fibroblasts treated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²) and/or PDGF-AB, or the corresponding antibodies in combination with rHuIFN-Î± or nHuIFN-Î±. Results We showed that neither IL-1Î² nor PDGF-AB significantly affect the viability of \{MRC5\} cells. Furthermore, cell viability was not affected when IL-1Î² or PDGF-AB were applied along with rHuIFN-Î±, relative to the viability of cells treated with rHuIFN-Î± only. In contrast, both cytokines suppressed the synthesis of procollagen type I mRNA. When coadministered with rHuIFN-Î±, IL-1Î² enhanced the suppression induced by rHuIFN-Î±. Conversely, PDGF-AB acted as an antagonist of rHuIFN-Î± and restored partially the synthesis of procollagen type I mRNA. Interestingly, the addition of IL-1Î² to the PDGF-AB/rHuIFN-Î± mix not only abolished the antagonistic activity of PDGF-AB but also decreased the synthesis of procollagen type I mRNA beyond the level achieved by IL-1Î²/rHuIFN-Î±. Therefore, IL-1Î² was able to reverse the activity of PDGF-AB. Conclusion Our study suggests that IL-1Î² is an important component of nHuIFN-Î± preparations, acting directly and indirectly to modulate the action of other components. This study provides insight into these complex cytokine networks, which is necessary for better and safer antifibrotic therapy.}}

In A 1 , the firing behavior is relatively simple for rigorous analysis, while it is more complicated on A 2 . First, we show that the delay Ï„ is a lower bound for the inter-spike intervals of each oscillator on A 1 . Using this lower bound, three important properties of the firing on A 1 are obtained: (a) Any complete synchronized solution is a solution with period 1; (b) If two oscillators fire at same time, and they have the same coupling strength from each other and from other oscillators, then, they will be synchronized forever; (c) The firing order of two oscillators is always preserved. However, examples can be provided to show that these properties do not hold for the region A 2 . Yet, numerical simulation still reveals some interesting phenomenon on A 2 : (a) Completely synchronized solutions are prevalent; (b) Given ( Ï„ , Îµ ) âˆˆ A 2 , the fraction of the initial values that will lead to complete synchronization will converge along with increasing network size.}}

Starting with one detailed case study, representatives of 38 small-scale fisher associations from two administrative regions were interviewed to investigate: (1) networks of actors in each co-management case, (2) the functions of these actors in co-management, and (3) fisher perceptions about Chile's co-management arrangement. Results indicate that decision-making is highly centralized and power is concentrated in government, with little horizontal exchange and cooperation among fisher associations. However, the network approach indicates the presence of a rich set of players, some seven sets of actors by function. Grassroots management innovations are hampered by the existing co-management structure, suggesting that the system may benefit from a modification of the policy to allow greater learning-by-doing and flexibility.}}

To address these issues, we developed an approach whereby tagged mammalian \{ENT1\} protein was over-expressed in mammalian cell lines, confirmed to be functional and isolated by affinity purification to sufficient levels to be analyzed using MALDI-TOF and tandem \{MS\} mass spectrometry. This proteomic approach will allow for a more detailed analysis of the structure, function and regulation of \{ENTs\} in the future.}}

abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) are capable of sensing fungi and then to initiate an appropriate defense against the invading microbe. We studied interactions between host and microorganism by analyzing the transcriptional response of \{DCs\} stimulated by the harmless Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of this phagocytosed fungus. Pathway analyses provided insight into the mutual interactions. Of particular interest was the responses elicited by the \{DC\} in the fungus, including downregulation of the carbon-compound metabolism, and upregulation of lipid, fatty acid, glyoxylate and tricarboxylic acid cycles. This indicates that the yeast shifts to a starvation mode and induces morphogenetic and autophagic pathways as well as those associated with reshaping cell wall composition, to resist the immune clearance. This yeast response is independent of the presence of virulence traits as the same transcriptional cell reprogramming has also been observed in potentially pathogenic C. albicans hyphae phagocytosed by macrophages. When comparing our results with the previous findings, it appears that the yeast dimorphic switch is only one of the components of the evolutionarily conserved panels of survival strategies elicited by phagocytosis. In conclusion, a systems biology approach, which combines genomics and pathway analyses, provides a powerful strategy to further our understanding of complex hostâ€“pathogen interactions and may ultimately define the distinguishing features of pathogenicity and commensalism.}}

It is thought that as the cell's circuitry gets re-wired by the constitutive activation of some pathways it becomes exquisitely dependent on this activity. Tumor cell death normally results from inhibiting constitutively active pathways. The dependence of tumor cells on the activity of these pathways has been called oncogene addiction. Approaches that aim to exploit loss of function, rather than gain of function changes have also become a powerful addition to our arsenal of cancer therapies. In particular, when tumors acquire mutations that disrupt pathways in the \{DNA\} damage response they rely on alternative pathways that can be targeted pharmacologically. Here we review the use of \{BRCA1\} as a marker of response to therapy with a particular focus on the use of Cisplatin and \{PARP\} inhibitors. We also explore the use of \{BRCA1\} as a marker of response to microtubule inhibitors and how all these approaches will bring us closer to the goal of personalized medicine in cancer treatment.}}

Many of these old mechanisms are still recognizable as \{ROS\} and oxygen-dependent pathways that probably were in place even before photosynthesis evolved. These processes are not only recognizable through relatively small molecules such as nucleotides and their derivatives. Also some \{DNA\} sequences such as the hypoxia response elements and pas gene family are ancient and have been co-opted in various functions. The products of pas genes, in addition to their function in regulating nuclear response to hypoxia as part of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF, play key roles in development, phototransduction, and control of circadian rhythmicity. Also RuBisCO, an enzyme best known for incorporating \{CO2\} into organic substrates in plants also has an ancient oxygenase function, which plays a key role in regulating peroxide balance in cells. As life forms became more complex and aerobic metabolism became dominant in multicellular organisms, the signaling processes also took on new levels of complexity but many ancient elements remained. The way in which they are integrated into remodeling processes involved in tradeoffs between respiration and nutrition or in control of aging in complex organisms is an exciting field for future research.}}

Natural (NS) and blanched almond skins (BS) were subjected to simulated gastric and duodenal digestion and used at not cytotoxic concentrations. \{NS\} induced a significant decrease in HSV-2 replication, whereas extracts obtained from \{BS\} did not significantly influence the viral replication. High levels of cytokines production, such as IFN-alpha (38 Â± 5.3 pg/ml), IL-12 (215 Â± 17.1 pg/ml), IFN-gamma (5 Â± 0.7 IU/ml), TNF-alpha (3940 Â± 201.0 pg/ml), were detected. Moreover, IL-10 (210 Â± 12.2 pg/ml) and IL-4 (170 Â± 21.4 pg/ml), representative of Th2 responses, were found.

Total acid concentrations were five times lower than total sugar concentrations in ripe berries, with citrate comprising roughly two thirds of the total acid content. The maximum extractable catalytic activities of key enzymes in the relevant metabolic pathways were also quantified during berry development, in an attempt to elucidate possible correlations. Sucrose synthase activity was very low or undetected, while neutral invertase activity was relatively high, suggesting that sucrose synthase does not make a significant contribution to sink strength in these cultivars. Three enzymes, invertase, pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFP) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), showed distinct activity patterns during development and may affect sugar and acid accumulation and sugar composition of strawberries.}}

This is an adaptive and distributed approach to power sharing across routers of a large network on chip and it is shown to be a scalable solution.

Chitosan/pectin polyelectrolyte complexes were prepared at pH 5.0 with different polycation/polyanion molar ratios and lyophilized in small inserts in the presence of chlorpromazine hydrochloride. The results show that higher amount of pectin in the complexes, with respect to higher amount of chitosan, produced a more evident porous structure of the nasal inserts, improving water uptake ability and mucoadhesion capacity. Finally, the presence of increasing amounts of pectin allowed the interaction with chlorpromazine hydrochloride inducing the formation of less hydratable inserts thus limiting drug release and permeation. This investigation verifies the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes between chitosan and pectin at pH values in the vicinity of the pKa interval of the two polymers and confirms the potential of these complexes, capable of achieving antipsychotic drug delivery in the nasal cavity.}}

The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential effects of proteasome inhibitor PS-341 on severe acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein and lipopolysaccharide in mice. Materials and Methods Severe acute pancreatitis was induced by seven intraperitoneal injections of 50 ug/kg cerulein at hourly intervals and one injection of 10mg/kg lipopolysaccharide in mice. Thirty min before the administration of lipopolysaccharide, mice were treated either with PS-341 or vehicle. The severity of acute pancreatitis was then evaluated by serum and pancreatic biochemical assays as well as histologic examination. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used for the first time to determine the therapeutic effects of interventions in situ. Results PS-341 significantly inhibited NF-ÎºB activation, while the pancreatic cell apoptosis was significantly enhanced, resulting in the improved parameters such as serum amylase, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, and pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity. Accordingly, pancreatic damage, including inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage, and necrosis, was markedly reduced. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography demonstrated that PS-341 significantly reduced the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose within the pancreas. Conclusions These observations demonstrate that PS-341 was able to significantly reduce the severity of acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein and lipopolysaccharide in mice. The potential effect is associated with the inhibition of NF-ÎºB activation and increased pancreatic cell apoptosis within the pancreas. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography could be a sensitive and promising means in evaluating the therapeutic effect and adjusting medical interventions for pancreatitis.}}

Within the nervous system, cellular and environmental determinants tightly control the expansion and differentiation of neural stem cells. Importantly, a number of studies have indicated that changes in cell cycle length can influence development and physiopathology of the nervous system, and might have played a role during evolution of the mammalian brain. Specifically, it has been suggested that the length of \{G1\} can directly influence the differentiation of neural precursors. This has prompted the proposal of a model to explain how manipulation of \{G1\} length can be used to expand neural stem cells. If validated in non-neural systems, this model might provide the means to control the proliferation vs. differentiation of somatic stem cells, which will represent a significant advance in the field.}}

In this article, the surface area is employed as a morphometric descriptor to study the concurrent changes between brain structures and to build binarized connectivity graphs. The statistical similarity in surface area between pair of regions was measured by computing the partial correlation coefficient across 186 normal subjects of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project. We demonstrated that connectivity matrices obtained follow a small-world behavior for two different parcellations of the brain gray matter. The properties of the connectivity matrices were compared to the matrices obtained using the mean cortical thickness for the same cortical parcellations. The topology of the cortical thickness and surface area networks were statistically different, demonstrating that both capture distinct properties of the interaction or different aspects of the same interaction (mechanical, anatomical, chemical, etc.) between brain structures. This finding could be explained by the fact that each descriptor is driven by distinct cellular mechanisms as result of a distinct genetic origin. To our knowledge, this is the first time that surface area is used to study the morphological connectivity of brain networks.}}

While much attention has been on the winning economic clusters of the world economy and the devastated industrial structures of the loser regions, little light has been shed on the urban zones in-between. This paper deals specifically with these zones from the perspective of accessibility issues around urban infrastructures, in particular transportation. It is argued that only a combined understanding of scaled and topological approaches allow us to capture the complexities of the politics of urban infrastructures in the in-between city. Conceptually, we outline the definitive characteristics of this new landscape with a particular view towards urban Canada.

The potential role of novel additional mediators has been highlighted by several reports. This review focuses on the recent information about the pathophysiology of the Wingless (Wnt) pathway and interleukin-17 (IL-17) in relation of their role in bone and joint remodeling. Methods An extensive internet search was performed (PubMed) from 1998 and onward using the following keywords: Wnt, bone remodeling, bone, rheumatic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, IL-17, Th17, osteoblastogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis. Results Several members of the Wnt pathway play an important role in bone remodeling. Recent experimental data indicate a key role for Dickkopf-1, a soluble inhibitor of the Wnt pathway, in bone remodeling. Increased Dickkopf-1 levels are linked to bone resorption and decreased levels to new bone formation. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5, the main receptor that mediates Wnt signaling, plays a critical role in bone mass regulation. Gain-of-function mutations of lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 cause high bone mass phenotypes, whereas loss-of-function mutations are linked to severe osteoporosis. IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced by a recently described T-cell subset, known as Th17 cells. Evidence suggests that IL-17 is a critical mediator of joint destruction in animal models of arthritis. IL-17 blockade has beneficial effects on murine arthritis, a fact that points to the direction of this cytokine as a potential therapeutic target in human inflammatory arthritides as well. Conclusions The available data suggest that mediators in these 2 biologic systems are critical in joint remodeling and may be appropriate targets in the treatment of bone and joint abnormalities that characterize a variety of inflammatory arthritides and bone diseases.}}

Thus, recent research has implicated mutations and polymorphisms of circadian clock genes in diabetes and obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. At the neuro-behavioral level, circadian clock genes have also been implicated in sleep disorders, drug and alcohol addiction, and other psychiatric conditions. While such findings are frequently described as revealing â€œnon-circadianâ€� effects of clock genes, it remains possible that most of these non-circadian effects are in fact secondary to the loss of cellular and systemic rhythmicity.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of shear lag in thin-walled box girder bridges with large width-to-span ratios through both experimental and numerical studies. A large-scale Plexiglas model is tested under different loading cases. The material parameters are obtained from physical characteristics tests and tensile tests. In addition, a computational model is presented for a comprehensive simulation of a girder bridge including the orthotropic top/bottom/web plates and their ribs, which leads to accurate modeling of structural properties of the girder. The simulation of the computation results compared well with the experimental results. It is illustrated that the finite element analysis is an effective method to predict properties of this class of bridges.}}

Jurkat cells actively migrated toward SDF-1, nutrition, and spheroids of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells embedded in collagen matrix. Inhibition of Zap70 activity impaired transmigration and Î¼-Slide chemotaxis but not the random movement of T cells in the collagen/fibronectin matrix. \{P116\} cells, a Zap70 deficient variant of Jurkat, showed active random movement but failed to migrate against chemoattractants. \{P116\} cells exhibited a reduced polarization of cell morphology, showing less lamellipodia formation accompanied with a fast pseudopod turnover rate. Instead of direct interacting with F-actin, Zap70 formed a complex with talin which is an integrin scaffold for F-actin. SDF-1 enhanced Zap70 phosphorylation and also stimulated binding of talin and Î²1 integrin activation. \{P116\} cells showed reduced complex of talin and Î²1 integrin in parallel with impaired integrin activation.

Here, we argue that trehalose should not be regarded only as a protective sugar but rather like a double-faced molecule and that further investigation is required to elucidate its exact role in stress tolerance in plants.}}

The incorporation of [3H]-glucosamine into both newly synthesised hyaluronic acid and sulphated \{GAGs\} and [35S]-sulphate into \{GAGs\} was used as an index of glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Quantitative evaluation of newly synthesised \{GAGs\} degradation was determined by pulse-chase experiments. We demonstrated that fibroblasts incubated in high glucose medium synthesised significant amounts of GAGs. Most of them were secreted into the culture medium. The shortage of glucose resulted in about 40% reduction in synthesis of GAGs, both those secreted into culture medium and remaining in the cell layer. The pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the reduced amount of newly synthesised glycosaminoglycans was protected against intracellular degradation. Proportionally less \{GAGs\} were degraded in cultures incubated in low glucose than in high glucose media. These phenomena were accompanied by an increase in the expression of chaperon â€“ \{ORP150\} in cultures growing in low glucose medium. We suggest that the increased expression of \{ORP150\} is a factor which prolongs the cell vitality and protects glycosaminoglycans against intracellular degradation induced by glucose deprivation.}}

This study investigates the design of an accurate system for control chart pattern (CCP) recognition from two aspects. First, an efficient system is introduced that includes two main modules: the feature extraction module and the classifier module. The feature extraction module uses the entropies of the wavelet packets. These are applied for the first time in this area. In the classifier module several neural networks, such as the multilayer perceptron and radial basis function, are investigated. Using an experimental study, we choose the best classifier in order to recognize the CCPs. Second, we propose a hybrid heuristic recognition system based on particle swarm optimization to improve the generalization performance of the classifier. The results obtained clearly confirm that further improvements in terms of recognition accuracy can be achieved by the proposed recognition system.}}

Both indexes yield distributions with equivalent statistical properties, which is a strong indicator for their consistency and logical connectedness.

Generated through the well-orchestrated and sequential processing of miRNA precursor molecules, mature miRNAs are subsequently incorporated into miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein effector complexes to regulate mRNA translation through the recognition of specific binding sites of imperfect complementarity located mainly in the 3â€² untranslated region. Predicted to regulate up to 90% of the genes in humans, miRNAs may thus control cellular processes in all cells and tissues of the human body. Likely to play a central role in health and disease, a dysfunctional miRNA-based regulation of gene expression may represent the main etiologic factor underlying diseases affecting major organs, such as the brain. In this review article, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role and function of miRNAs in the regulation of genes involved in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed, with a focus on the fragile X syndrome, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion disease.}}

On the basis of shape, inner arrangement, growth forms and taxonomic coralline algal composition, two rhodolith growth stages were distinguished: (1) nucleation and growth of the rhodoliths, and (2) a final growth stage before burial. Nucleation is characterized by melobesioids and subordinately mastophoroids, with rare sporolithaceans and lithophylloids. The rhodolith growth (main increase in size) is represented by abundant melobesioids and rare to common mastophoroids; very rare sporolithaceans are also present. The final growth stage is dominated by melobesioids with rare mastophoroids and very rare sporolithaceans. Each rhodolith growth stage is characterized by a distinct suite of inner arrangement and growth form successions. Well diversified ichnocoenoeses (Gastrochaenolites, Trypanites, Meandropolydora and/or Caulostrepsis, Entobia, Uniglobites, micro-borings) related to bivalves, sponges, polychaetes, barnacles, algae, fungi, and bacteria are distinguished in the inner/intermediate rhodolith growth stage, while mainly algal, fungal and bacterial micro-borings are present in the outer final growth stage. Rhodolith growth stages and associated ichnocoenoeses indicate significant change in the depositional setting during the rhodolith growth. In the Vitulano area, the Middle Miocene rhodolith assemblages formed in a shallow-water open-shelf carbonate platform, were susceptible to exportation from their production area and then to sedimentation down to deeper-water hemipelagic settings, where the rhodoliths shortly kept growth and were finally buried. Such re-deposition of unlithified or only weakly lithified (i.e. rhodoliths and intraclasts) shallow-water carbonates into deeper-water settings was likely favoured by storm-generated offshore return currents rather than sediment gravity flows.}}

Characterization showed that substoichiometric samples correspond to well-dispersed \{VO4\} units in the MgO matrix. Moreover, taking into account the Raman data, the coexistence of ortho, pyro and meta vanadate phases cannot be discarded. The Mg3V2O8 sample was more active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane, but less selective to \{C4\} alkenes than the Mg2V2O7 sample. Stoichiometric samples produce mainly 1-butene, whereas for substoichiometric samples butadiene was the major reaction product for reaction temperatures higher than 748 K. The easily reducible \{VO4\} species, and eventually the coexistence of different vanadates phases, appear to be responsible for the catalytic behaviour displayed by the substoichiometric catalysts prepared by citrate technique.}}

The functional connectivity maps created were stringently validated by controlling for false positive detection of correlation, the physiologic basis of the signal source, as well as quantitatively evaluating the reproducibility of maps.

Portal pressure, graft injury, interleukin 6 (IL-6), signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cyclin D1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were all assessed. Results The portal pressure was significantly higher and hepatic injury more severe in the smaller sized groups than in the whole graft group, especially in the 30%-size grafts. Hepatic IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) levels in the two smaller sized groups were significantly higher than in the whole graft group, while IL-6 levels appeared to be negatively associated with graft sizes. Downstream markers of IL-6, Stat3 and \{MAPK\} phosphorylation, cyclin D1, and \{PCNA\} expression were also markedly increased in the small-sized grafts compared with the whole grafts, and appeared to positively correlate with early measurements of portal pressure and subsequent hepatic injury. Conclusion Vigorous hepatic regeneration in small-for-size liver grafts may be associated with highly activated IL-6/Stat3 and \{MAPK\} signaling, which may in turn correlate with graft size, portal pressure, and hepatic injury.}}

Second, the defined phases of an eventâ€™s happening are staged (an advent, its multiplication into a crisis in the context of a milieu, and a response/recovery phase).

However, controversial empirical evidence and mathematical formalism concerning decoherence rates of bioprocesses keep these frameworks from satisfactorily accounting for the physical nature of cognitive-like events. This study, inspired by the discovery that preferential attachment rules computed by complex technological networks obey Boseâ€“Einstein statistics, is the first rigorous attempt to examine whether analogues of Boseâ€“Einstein condensation precipitate learned decision making in live biological systems as bioenergetics optimization predicts. By exploiting the ciliate Spirostomum ambiguum's capacity to learn and store behavioral strategies advertising mating availability into heuristics of topologically invariant computational networks, three distinct phases of strategy use were found to map onto statistical distributions described by Boseâ€“Einstein, Fermiâ€“Dirac, and classical Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann behavior. Ciliates that sensitized or habituated signaling patterns to emit brief periods of either deceptive â€˜harder-to-getâ€™ or altruistic â€˜easier-to-getâ€™ serial escape reactions began testing condensed on initially perceived fittest â€˜courtingâ€™ solutions. When these ciliates switched from their first strategy choices, Boseâ€“Einstein condensation of strategy use abruptly dissipated into a Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann computational phase no longer dominated by a single fittest strategy. Recursive trial-and-error strategy searches annealed strategy use back into a condensed phase consistent with performance optimization. â€˜Socialâ€™ decisions performed by ciliates showing no nonassociative learning were largely governed by Fermiâ€“Dirac statistics, resulting in degenerate distributions of strategy choices. These findings corroborate previous work demonstrating ciliates with improving expertise search grouped â€˜courtingâ€™ assurances at quantum efficiencies and verify efficient processing by primitive â€˜socialâ€™ intelligences involves network forms of Boseâ€“Einstein condensation coupled to preceding thermodynamic-sensitive computational phases.}}

Global regulators are frequently two-component systems; for example, the PhoRâ€“PhoP system, the AsbA1â€“AsbA2, the orphan response regulator GlnR and the STAND-family regulator AfsR. Several strategies have been used to obtain overproducer strains, including: (i) obtention of phosphate-deregulated mutants by alteration of phoP, (ii) amplification and/or overexpression of pathway-associated positive regulators, and (iii) modification of butyrolactone receptor proteins.

However, with feature size scaling down, the resistance of via is increasing quickly and their influence on voltage drop of P/G networks has become obvious. In this paper, two optimization techniques for via placement are proposed, which are proved to be helpful in reducing on die voltage drop. Firstly, an efficient heuristic algorithm based on sensitivity analysis is presented to optimize via distribution in early design stage. Compared with even distribution design strategies, averagely the heuristic algorithm can reduce the worst voltage drop by 8.43% without adding more vias. Secondly, experiments demonstrated that using stacked vias in nonadjacent layers is powerful in eliminating â€œhotâ€� areas which suffer from large voltage drop. Based on this observation, a heuristic algorithm is developed to further reduce the worst voltage drop. Experiments show that voltage drop distribution can be well optimized by combining these two strategies together.}}

In the present investigation, we compared the alkaline pH-induced unfolding of two homologous serine hydroxymethyltransferase from mesophilic Bacillus subtilis (bsSHMT) and thermophilic Bacillus stearothermophilus (bstSHMT) using various biophysical techniques. The thermophilic enzyme bstSHMT was found to be more resistant to alkaline denaturation compared to its mesophilic counterpart, bsSHMT. Unfolding studies using domain-swapped chimera, constructed by swapping the C-terminal domain of these two wild-type proteins, revealed that C-terminal domain plays a pivotal role in the folding, stability and subunit interaction of these proteins. Primary amino acid sequence analysis of the proteins showed that bsSHMT has six unconserved lysine residues in C-terminal domain, which are absent in bstSHMT. Chemical modification of lysine side chains resulted in stabilization of monomers, only in case of bsSHMT. Moreover, comparison between homology model of bsSHMT with the crystal structure of bstSHMT revealed that a small stretch of 11 amino acids at the end of C-terminal domain was found protruding outside the molecule as a flexible coiled structure in bsSHMT. Taken together these findings suggest that possibly the presence of these non-identical lysine moieties and a small extension of C-terminal domain may be responsible for low stability of bsSHMT under alkaline pH condition.}}

These regulatory molecules are synthesized from cholesterol in endocrine organs â€“ such as the adrenal glands and gonads â€“ via a multi-step enzymatic process that is catalyzed by the cytochrome \{P450\} superfamily of monooxygenases and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Steroidogenesis is induced by trophic peptide hormones primarily via the activation of a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathway. However, other signaling molecules, including cytokines and growth factors, control the steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway. More recently, sphingolipids, including ceramide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and sphingosine, have been found to modulate steroid hormone secretion at multiple levels. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the mechanisms by which sphingolipids regulate steroidogenesis. In addition, we discuss how steroid hormones control sphingolipid metabolism. Finally, we outline evidence supporting the emerging role of bioactive sphingolipids in various nuclear processes and discuss a role for nuclear sphingolipid metabolism in the control of gene transcription.}}

True proximity and functional relevance can be revealed by studying the three-dimensional structure of the genome packaged inside the nucleus. Thus the spatial architecture of the genome has attracted a lot of interest and has intensified its significance in modern cell biology.

In this study, to further evaluate the role of rCRAMP in innate immunity of brain cells, we investigated the impact of rCRAMP on glial cell activation. To this end we analyzed the activation of rCRAMP-induced signalling by cytokine expression, Western blotting of certain signal transduction pathways and by cAMP level measurement in primary rat glial cells (astrocytes and microglia). We demonstrate (i) the induction of proinflammatory cytokine and neurotrophic factors and (ii) the activation of various signal transduction pathways by rCRAMP in glial cells. Moreover, (iii) we have been able to show that rCRAMP-induced IL-6 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in glial cells were attenuated by the antagonists for purinergic receptor P2Y, whereas \{P2X\} and \{FPRL1\} antagonists do not show any effects. Our results indicate for the first time that a newly identified \{P2Y11\} receptor participates in rCRAMP-induced signal transduction. This study provides evidence that rCRAMP participates in brain immunity by stimulating cytokine production and glial cell activation, and aid in the protection of brain cells by inducing neurotrophic factors.}}

Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change. We propose a framework based on ideas from global-change biology, community ecology, and invasion biology that uses community modules to assess how species interactions shape responses to climate change.}}

The diagnosis of an adnexal mass is a prevalent issue among women in the United States, although current methods of identifying those at high risk of malignancy remain insufficient. Ineffective triage of women with malignant masses is associated with delayed or inappropriate treatment and a negative effect on disease outcome. Methods. We performed an evaluation of 65 ovarian cancer-related biomarkers in the circulation of women diagnosed with an adnexal mass. Our subject group consisted of women diagnosed with benign masses and early- and late-stage ovarian cancer. Results. More than half of the biomarkers tested were found to differ significantly between benign and malignant cases. As individual markers, \{HE4\} and CA-125 provided the greatest level of discrimination between benign and malignant cases, and the combination of these two biomarkers provided a higher level of discriminatory power than either marker considered alone. Multivariate statistical analysis identified several multimarker panels that could discriminate early-stage, late-stage, and combined ovarian cancers from benign cases with similar or slightly improved SN/SP levels to the CA-125/HE4 combination; however, these larger panels could not outperform the 2-biomarker panel in an independent validation set. We also identified a 3-biomarker panel with particular utility in premenopausal women. Conclusions. Our findings serve to advance the development of blood-based screening methods for the discrimination of benign and malignant ovarian masses by confirming and expanding upon the superior utility of the CA-125/HE4 combination.}}

Topographic and source analysis identified four distinct processing steps between 200 and 1000 ms. Activation started ipsilateral to the stimulated nostril in the mesial and lateral temporal cortex (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula). Subsequently, the corresponding structures on the contralateral side became involved, followed by frontal structures at the end of the activation period. Thus, based on EEG-related data, current results suggest that olfactory information in humans is processed first ipsilaterally to the stimulated nostril and then activates the major relays in olfactory information processing in both hemispheres. Most importantly, the currently described techniques allow the investigation of the spatial processing of olfactory information at a high temporal resolution.}}

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of dexamethasone on bupivacaine-induced toxicity in mouse neuroblastoma \{N2a\} cells. \{N2a\} cells were exposed to bupivacaine in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. After treatment, the cell viability, nuclear condensation, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were evaluated. Mitochondrial potential and Akt (threonineâ€“serine protein kinase B) activation were also examined. In a separate experiment, we examined the effect of Akt inhibition by triciribine on cell viability following dexamethasone treatment. We also investigated whether dexamethasone could prevent lidocaine-induced neurotoxicity. Treatment of \{N2a\} cells with bupivacaine resulted in significant cell injury as evidenced by morphological changes, \{LDH\} leakage, and nuclear condensation. Pretreatment of the cells with dexamethasone significantly attenuated bupivacaine- and lidocaine-induced cell injury. Dexamethasone treatment prevented the decline of mitochondrial potential caused by bupivacaine and increased the levels of Akt phosphorylation. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of Akt abolished the protective effect of dexamethasone against bupivacaine-induced cell injury. Our data suggest that pretreatment of neuroblastoma cells with dexamethasone exerts a protective effect on bupivacaine-induced neuronal cell injury.

Addition of methanol (1.5% v/v) into fermentation medium could increase GlcN content from 0.21 (control) to 0.26 g/gdw cells and led to maximum GlcN concentration of 7.48 g/L obtained.}}

We aimed to increase bioreactor performance by using an electrochemical system to regulate the electrical potential on supporting material. At an organic loading rate of 26.9 g dichromate chemical oxygen demand (CODcr)/L/day, reactors with a potential of âˆ’0.6 or âˆ’0.8 V, generated by a cathodic electrochemical reaction, showed greater removal of \{CODcr\} and methanogenesis than reactors with a potential of 0.0 or âˆ’0.3 V, generated by anodic reaction, or control reactors without electrochemical regulation. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that the same methanogens were present in all our reactors, but quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that higher prokaryotic and methanogenic copy numbers were present on cathodic electrodes than on anodic or control electrodes. These results indicate that cathodic electrochemical regulation can support methane fermentation from garbage.}}

Here, we list the secreted factors that make up the proinflammatory phenotype of senescent cells and describe the impact of these factors on tissue homeostasis. We also summarize the cellular pathways/processes that are known to regulate this phenotype â€“ namely, the \{DNA\} damage response, microRNAs, key transcription factors and kinases and chromatin remodeling.}}

In this mini review, we summarize published work in this field, and propose several mechanisms for how \{SLRPs\} can control collagen matrix structure and function. \{SLRPs\} appear to influence collagen cross-linking patterns. We also propose that the SLRP-collagen interactions can assist in the process of juxtaposing the collagen monomers by steric hindrance or by directly connecting two collagen monomers during the fibril growth.}}

The role of the interleukin-6/glycoprotein 130 (gp130) system in this context is still undefined. Therefore, conditional gp130 knockout and knockin mice were used to achieve hepatocyte-specific deletions of gp130 (gp130Î”hepa), gp130-dependent ras (gp130Î”hepaRas), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) (gp130Î”hepaSTAT) activation. These mice were treated with a DDC-containing diet and analyzed over time. Mice deficient in hepatic gp130 and \{STAT\} signaling showed increased and earlier mortality than wild-type and gp130Î”hepaRas animals. Over time, significantly more apoptosis and cholestasis became evident in gp130Î”hepa and gp130Î”hepaSTAT mice. These mice also displayed increased tumor necrosis factor-Î± expression, a diminished acute-phase response (lack of \{STAT3\} and serum amyloid A activation), and enhanced immune cell infiltration in the liver. These were associated with stronger periportal oval cell activation. In addition, \{DDC\} treatment in gp130Î”hepa and gp130Î”hepaSTAT mice resulted in significantly stronger hepatic stellate cell activation. Long-term analysis revealed the development of severe liver fibrosis in gp130Î”hepa and gp130Î”hepaSTAT animals, as evidenced by increased collagen accumulation. Here we demonstrate that gp130/STAT signaling in hepatocytes provides protection in a cholestatic hepatitis mouse model. STAT3-dependent signaling pathways in hepatocytes protect from apoptosis and tissue injury, which subsequently reduce oval cell activation and prevent fibrosis progression.}}

Determination of the macerals in coal requires sophisticated microscopic instrumentation and expertise, unlike the other two properties mentioned above. In the present paper, an attempt has been made to predict the concentration of macerals of Indian coals using artificial neural network (ANN) by incorporating the proximate and ultimate analysis of coal. To investigate the appropriateness of this approach, the predictions by \{ANN\} are also compared with conventional multi-variate regression analysis (MVRA). For the prediction of macerals concentration, data sets have been taken from different coalfields of India for training and testing of the network. Network is trained by 149 datasets with 700 epochs, and tested and validated by 18 datasets. It was found that coefficient of determination between measured and predicted macerals by \{ANN\} was quite higher as well as mean absolute percentage error was very marginal as compared to \{MVRA\} prediction.}}

Cell culture studies on the nanofiber mats were carried out using human dermal fibroblasts, and healthy cell morphology was observed. The adherent viable cells were quantified by \{MTS\} after rinsing in excess buffer solution. The results showed that these nanofiber scaffolds supported excellent cell adhesion, comparable with the pure \{PCL\} nanofibers. The increased hydrophilicity of these hydrogel nanofiber mats led to a more rapid hydrolytic degradation, compared with the pure \{PCL\} nanofiber mats.

The ice concentrations derived from aerial images and the AMSR-E/ASI products were comparable to each other, especially in the range of 50â€“90%. However, the satellite-derived data overestimated the aerial observations by 14 Â± 9% in areas with large ice concentrations (&gt; 90%), and nearly ignored those with very low ice concentrations (&lt; 20%). In addition, a significantly higher amount of melt ponds was observed in the \{PAS\} in the summer of 2008 as compared to five years ago. The areally averaged albedo increased from 0.09 in the marginal ice zone at 77Â°N to 0.63 in the far north zone at 86Â°N, where the ice concentration was 90%. The albedo was significantly smaller than those reported in earlier studies in the \{PAS\} for the same region because of an overall decrease in ice concentration. Compared with 2007 data, the lower ice concentration in 2008 may yield a smaller total ice-covered area, although the Arctic ice extent in 2008 was slightly larger than the record minimum in 2007.}}

Proteins extracted from osteosarcoma tissue and benign bone tumors, including osteoblastoma, chondroblastoma, and giant cell tumor of bone, were examined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis and database searches. We also validated the expression levels of interesting proteins by Western blotting assay and immunohistochemical staining. Intensity alterations of 30 spots were detected in osteosarcoma, and 18 of these spots were finally identified, including 12 up-regulated proteins and 6 down-regulated ones. The up-regulated proteins include VIM, TUBA1C, ZNF133, EZR, ACTG1, TF, and so on. The six down-regulated proteins include ADCY1, ATP5B, TUBB, RCN3, ACTB, and YWHAZ. Subsequent immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting assay for \{TUBA1C\} and \{ZNF133\} in osteosarcoma samples confirmed the observation obtained by proteomic analysis. Our results suggest that these identified proteins may be potential biomarkers for osteosarcoma tumorigenesis and therapeutics. Aberrant expression of cytoskeletal- and microtubule-associated proteins in osteosarcoma may provide an advantage for tumor invasion and metastasis by affecting the stability of microtubule, which consequently influences the prognosis of patients.}}

In the first part of the study, peripheral blood was collected from captive female harbour seals of various ages. Data showed an age-related decrease in phagocytosis in female harbour seals from sub-adult to adulthood. In the second part of the study, changes in phagocytosis were quantified during lactation in wild newborn harbour, grey and harp seals and in their mothers (harp and grey seals). In newborns of the same age, leukocytes of harbour and harp seals phagocytosed less than those of grey seal pups. The phagocytic activity and efficiency increased significantly from early to mid-lactation in newborn harbour seals, and from early to late lactation in newborn grey seals, which could suggest that the transfer of phagocytosis-promoting factor(s) in colostrum is an important feature of temporary protection for pups. In contrast, no changes in phagocytic activity and efficiency were observed in lactating females of the two seal species, harp and grey, examined. At late lactation, phagocytic activity in both grey and harp seal pups and phagocytic efficiency in grey seal pups were significantly higher than in their mothers. These results could reflect either the capacity of phagocytes of the newborn harp and grey seals to respond to pathogens. Results from this study suggest that the phagocytosis of the seal species examined is not fully developed at birth as it generally increases in pups during lactation. Thereafter, the phagocytic activity of seals appears to decrease throughout adulthood.}}

To examine its impact on seagrass macrofaunal communities, we compared the abundance, diversity and taxa composition by quantitative samplings in 2001 (before the tsunami) and in 2005 and 2006 (after the tsunami). Macrobenthic animals and sediments were collected from vegetated and nonvegetated areas of two sites that had received different levels of tsunami disturbances. A large decline in abundance and diversity was observed in the nonvegetated areas after the tsunami, whereas an increase was observed in the vegetated areas. The magnitude of decline and subsequent recovery of abundance and diversity of macrobenthic animals in nonvegetated areas were similar between the two sites, suggesting that their temporal changes were not solely related to the magnitude of the tsunami disturbance. Similarity of the benthic animals differed greatly between 2001 and 2005â€“2006 at the nonvegetated areas, whereas it varied less among the 3 years at the seagrass-vegetated areas. This study demonstrated that the presence of seagrass vegetation alters the patterns of temporal variation in macrofaunal assemblages and subsequent recovery processes following a tsunami.}}

abstract = {Artificial neural network (ANN) is a powerful tool in optimizing many industrial processes. In the present study, an \{ANN\} was developed to model and predict the bake hardenability and final yield stress of low carbon steels. Five parameters affecting the bake hardening were considered as inputs, including the annealing/reheating temperature, cooling rate, initial yield stress, work hardening and carbon level. The network was then trained so that to predict the bake hardening amounts and the final yield stress as outputs. A Multilayer cascade-forward back-propagation network is developed and trained using experimental work. Two low carbon steels, St12 and St14, were investigated. The effects of annealing/reheating temperature (500â€“1000 Â°C) and subsequent cooling rate (0.5, 5 and 500 Â°C/s) on the bake hardenability of steels were modeled by \{ANN\} as well. In terms of cooling rate, two different behaviors were observed. The bake hardenability of St12 was increased from 13 Â± 2, for reheating to 500 Â°C, to 88 Â± 2 \{MPa\} for the reheating temperature of 1000 Â°C. As for St14, these values were respectively 8 Â± 2 and 67 Â± 2 MPa. The predicted values are in very good agreement with the measured ones indicating that the developed model is very accurate and has the great ability for predicting the bake hardenability.}}

abstract = {Plants provide herbivores with an array of chemicals with the potential to improve health and well-being. For instance, phytochemicals, known as secondary compounds, which protect plants from consumers and pests can adversely affect cellular and metabolic processes in herbivores, but at low doses and in appropriate mixtures, they can have beneficial effects on animal nutrition and health, though the latter has not been explored in great breadth or depth. In this review, we summarize the potential impact of natural plant products on immunomodulation and other therapeutic effects in herbivores. Development of preventative strategies to help animals resist disease would be a more economical, ecological and socially effective long-term healthcare strategy than treating diseases. In this realm, immunomodulation promoted by forages emerges as an interesting alternative and complement to chemotherapy. The challenge for feeding systems will be to incorporate mixes of plants with bioactive properties in ways that enhance health without compromising animal production and well-being. A solution to this challenge may involve developing management programs that acknowledge the ability of animals to learn about the beneficial effects of diverse foods.}}

abstract = {We conducted a population-based study on 738 schoolchildren who received two doses of rubella vaccine in order to determine cytokine secretion patterns and their associations with demographic and clinical variables. The results showed a robust rubella-specific inflammatory cytokine response characterized by high median [inter-quartile range (IQR)] secretion levels (in pg/mL) of IL-6 [3681.0 (3160.0, 4052.0)], GM-CSF [28.0 (23.6, 32.6)], and TNF-Î± [29.7 (âˆ’7.0, 89.2)]. We also detected modest levels of rubella-specific secretion of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-Î³, while IL-12p40 was undetectable. In contrast, rubella-specific Th2 responses were hardly detectable. Age at vaccination, enrollment, and time elapsed between last vaccination and enrollment was significantly associated with the outcome of IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-Î³ secretion. These results suggest an immune-deviation or â€œskewingâ€� from Th1/Th2 cytokine patterns towards a predominant inflammatory response upon in vitro rubella virus stimulation.}}

This study aimed at clarifying the role of different cytokines (VEGF, TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-18) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and in the serum of lung cancer patients at baseline and during RT. Bronchoscopy and \{BAL\} were performed on 36 lung cancer patients and 36 controls for diagnosis; patients receiving \{RT\} had a second bronchoscopy during RT. Serum samples were obtained during \{RT\} and three months after RT. In this study lung cancer patients had higher levels of serum and \{BAL\} fluid IL-6 and serum IL-8 compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.039 and p = 0.030, respectively). \{RT\} caused a significant increase of \{BAL\} fluid IL-6 (p = 0.037). There were no significant associations between baseline cytokine levels and adverse events or response to treatment. Higher baseline serum and \{BAL\} fluid IL-8 and serum \{VEGF\} levels (p = 0.036, p = 0.027 and p = 0.014, respectively) were associated with shorter survival. This study shows that lung cancer is associated with upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8. The increase of \{BAL\} fluid IL-6 during \{RT\} might be attributed to enhanced RT-related oxidative stress or increased cell death. Serum and \{BAL\} fluid IL-8 and serum \{VEGF\} might have a prognostic role in survival of lung cancer.}}

abstract = {Inhalation is an important route of cadmium (Cd) exposure, and the lung is considered to be one of the main target organs of Cd toxicity. Pulmonary inflammation seems to be involved in development of many lung diseases. In the present study we show that Cd2+ at fairly low concentrations affects gene expression of several different cytokines/chemokines in human \{M1\} fibroblasts. The chemokines CXCL2, CXCL3, IL-8/CXCL8 and CCL26, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and the receptor IL-1RL1 were expressed at high levels after exposure to 7 Î¼M Cd2+ for 7 h. The expression of some important cytokines was further studied in two different primary cell cultures from rat lungs. Cd2+ induced cytokine responses at low concentrations (3â€“6 Î¼M) and early time-points both in type 2 epithelial cell-enriched cultures and alveolar macrophages. However, the two primary lung cells displayed different patterns of cytokine release. Cd2+ induced an increased release of IL-6 and MIP-2/CXCL2 from the epithelial cells and MIP-2, IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± from alveolar macrophages. In conclusion, the marked up-regulation of different cytokines in these cell types, that are important in development of lung injury and disease, suggests that inflammation may contribute in Cd-induced lung damage.}}

In Brazil, the North Region has a high distribution coefficient worsened by the significant number of eventually unreported cases, due to difficulties in access to health services, to the natural geographic barriers and the vast territory. In the Rio Negro area, the species Bothrops atrox, Bothrops brazili, Lachesis muta muta and Bothriopsis taeniata are thought to be the major species responsible for snakebites. The aim of this study was to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the antigenic cross-reactivity and expression of toxins and the immunogenicity of Bothrops venom species of the Amazon and to evaluate the general efficacy of the therapeutic sera. The in vivo assays demonstrated that the defibrinating activity of B. taeniata venom was absent but that the lethal and hemorrhagic properties were more intense than in the B. atrox venom. The results evidence venom variability among the two B. atrox populations from two distinct Amazonian regions, which may reveal a subjacent speciation process. The results point to new aspects that may guide the improvement of anti-Bothropic therapeutic serum.}}
