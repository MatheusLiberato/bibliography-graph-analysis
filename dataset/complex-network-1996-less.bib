This procedure is continued until no more redundant components can be added within the available resources.

abstract = {Model design involves generation and selection of a model that accurately describes the process, as well as reliable quality assessment of this model. Using neural networks as models simplifies the model-generation step, but aggravates the selection step due to the large number of models to be considered and the large number of parameters in each of these models. In process-engineering applications, where measured data are expensive and therefore limited, the design of neural-network models is even more difficult, because the selection step gets worse with less data. This work is concerned with the selection of a network model that best represents the process based on limited available data. Three different methods for model selection are compared on a simulation example using feedback neural networks as models. One method uses a static-split of the available data into a training set and a test set; the other method, the so-called cross-validation, uses a dynamic split of the data; and the third method uses statistical evaluation without splitting the data. The comparison reveals that, in a realistic situation of limited data size that is typical of process-engineering applications, only the cross-validation approach accurately selects the best model and reliably assesses its quality. The statistical evaluation without splitting the data yields misleading results, choosing a severely suboptimal network as the best one. None of the various possible static-splits reliably selects the best model, whereby the frequently used static-split of the available data into two aproximately equal-sized sets for training and testing shows the worst performance among the various investigated static-splits. Furthermore, results show that a partially trained over-complex network model, which is often employed as a short-cut to optimal-network selection, may yield a significantly inferior process representation compared to the optimally complex network trained without premature termination.

Nodes representing exterior surfaces, whose temperatures do not have to be explicitly determined, are eliminated by the Norton theorem. The resulting simplified, but still complex networks, are split into subnetworks corresponding to rooms by removing a few simple components; the solutions for the subnetworks are found by means of the nodal formulation and are then coupled to give the system solution, without ever having to solve directly the initial complex network. There are no errors introduced by this decomposition process. This significantly simplifies the analysis of the building network and provides physical insight into the modelling and coupling of its subsystems. "

However, the experimental procedure used here gives reliable information about the quality of the concrete in terms of air permeability and hence, durability. The significance of research is twofold. Firstly, this is a systematic log-term study throughout 20 years which results have been fitted to a logistic equation.

Study of silver-stained \{AMV\} whole-mounts revealed sprouting of injured axons as early as 14 h post-lesion (hpl), with a complex network of fibres formed by 48 hpl. Signs of fibre degeneration were also apparent from 48 hpl, increasing in extent until 15 days post-lesion (dpl). Fragmentation was largely confined to specific fibre bundles, constituted by the distal portions of severed axons. Although some degeneration of regenerated axons was evident from 15Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20 dpl, many remained intact beyond this time, particularly in the area adjacent to the exit of the trochlear nerve, where most regenerated fibres penetrated the ipsilateral trochlear nerve. Counts of \{HRP\} filled neurons in the trochlear nucleus after injection of the superior oblique muscle showed that axons entering the \{IVth\} nerve rootlet were exclusively ipsilateral trochlear fibres. Less than 50% regenerated; most other severed axons degenerated. The few axons remaining in the \{AMV\} may have been fibres, undamaged by the original lesion, which normally course longitudinally through the ipsilateral AMV. These results show that \{IVth\} nerve fibres preferentially enter \{IVth\} nerve rootlets and, in so doing, survive the effects of injury. Most other \{CNS\} axons in the \{AMV\} which do not enter the trochlear root probably degenerate. "

However, recent studies employing cryopreparation have shown that the non-secreting membrane in these cells is actually a complex network of helically coiled tubules. Here, we present an alternative model to explain how the membrane in parietal cells is activated to secrete HCI. "

In this study, blends of polyaniline together with poly (methyl methacrylate) have been investigated by transmission electron microscopy to reveal the nature of the conductive pathways that are present at low filling fractions. The blends appear as a partially phase-separated structure with neither phase forming distinct domain boundaries. On removal of the insulating matrix, the polyaniline is observed to collapse into a complex network, in which spanning connections are present at all fractions above the conductive onset. Compatibilization of the polymers by the action of the surfactant counter ion and bound solvent is discussed as the means by which solubility and partial intimate mixing of the macromolecules are induced and from which conducting pathways arise.

A stacking fault energy for Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V was calculated to be 15.4erg cmÃ¢Ë†â€™2. This value indicated that the alloy had low stacking fault energy.

(Re)Defining the self is a model that considers the woman as a holistic organism existing within a complex network of social interactions.

The most prominent change was the extensive and severe edematous condition in the interstitial space. After 7 weeks of treatment, the interstitial space between neurons and nerve fibers was distended by proteinaceous edematous fluid and collagen fibers. Distention of the intercellular space between the ganglion neurons and their surrounding satellite cell sheaths also occurred. Proliferation of the supporting cells, especially the satellite cells and Schwann cells, producing long and complex networks of cellular processes in the distended interstitial space was also evident. It is believed that chronic ingestion of corn oil by rats has an adverse effect on the endothelial system leading to an increased fluid permeability and edematous condition. "

The algorithm employs a variaton of the simulated annealing approach coupled with a hierarchical strategy to achieve the gobal optimum. For complex networks, the present algorithm is advantageous over the traditional heuristic procedures. The solutions of two representative example network optimization problems are presented to illustrate the present algorithm.

Locally, the injection veins of pseudotachylyte and fault gouge can be traced back to the fault veins. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and petrological analysis indicate that both of the pseudotachylyte and fault gouge consist entirely of fine-grained angular clasts and that the pseudotachylytes and fault gouges have a similar X-ray diffraction patterns with that of the host granite. The similarity of chemical compositions and distribution patterns of grain size also show that the injection veins of pseudotachylyte and fault gouge have the same source material as that of fault veins. Field occurrences and petrological characteristics strongly suggest that the injection veins of pseudotachylyte and fault gouge formed during seismic faulting by a rapid intrusion and fluidization of crushed fine-grained materials generated in the shear zone in a gas-solid-fluid system.

We outline the important characteristics of optimal buffer control policies for a single node, and using a dynamic programming formulation for a simple two-node network, gain insights into the much harder general multi-node problem. The key result we present is that simple non-work-conserving policies which use limited feedback from adjacent nodes can reduce cell loss significantly. We construct a feedback-based control that uses simple Ã¢â‚¬Å“stop-and-goÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rules. This control is then enhanced to react to rapidly changing network conditions. This new control is called the Adaptive \{HILO\} policy. Simulation studies of complex networks with large delay-bandwidth product show that the Adaptive \{HILO\} policy performs impressively under diverse conditions. Using intuitive arguments, we demonstrate that this policy effectively utilizes unused buffer capacity in upstream buffers during periods of heavy load in downstream buffers. "

Six classes (male and female adults, subadults and juveniles) were tested with 12 types of odour stimuli, including the natural marks of whole families and the urine of individual mice collected from resident and unfamiliar families. Differences in response to odours between classes, and between odours within classes, were due to the amount of time spent closely investigating the test odour and to the frequency of marks deposited on the test odour, but not to the amount of time spent in other behaviours, the frequency of visits to the test odour, the delay to the first visit, or the lenght of marks deposited. Unfamiliar odour stimuli were not generally investigated or marked more than familiar odours, except for the natural marks of entire families, and unfamiliar family marks did not deter invasion of a new area. Mice within each class responded to specific odour cues and there was little correspondence between investigatory and marking responses. The most interesting findings were the lack of investigation and comparatively low marking response of adult males towards unfamiliar male urine; investigation and marking of clean areas by females; prolonged investigation of female urine by male and female mice of all ages except breeding adult females; prolonged investigation of male urine by subadult males; comparatively heavy marking of female stimuli by adult males, adult females and subadult females; and the low frequency but significant mark responses of subadult and juvenile mice. The results are compared with those of previous studies in test arenas and a new model is proposed to account for marking behaviour.

abstract = {The pyrolysis of organic matter enclosed in natural phosphate was investigated under non-isothermal conditions in order to analyse the kinetics of the reactions involved in the release of gases. Such retorting is often conducted industrially to increase the purity of the phosphate and to minimize the manufacturing cost of phosphoric acid. Hydrogen release occurs in a series of three overlapping waves covering a large range of temperature (300Ã¢â‚¬â€œ950 Ã‚Â°C). Methane evolution starts at 350 Ã‚Â°C and continues up to 750 Ã‚Â°C. An increase in the \{H2\} concentration in the carrier gas leads to the appearance of a second wave of CH4. Hydrogen sulphide evolves at lower temperatures; it originates essentially from thiophenic compounds. The release of \{CO2\} occurs in three peaks which are attributed to the decomposition of CaCO3 and to subsequent reactions of the residual carbon with the phosphate matrix. At temperatures &gt; 600 Ã‚Â°C the formation of all the gases analysed involves a complex network of reactions. "

The factors responsible for mesangial cell growth regulation in vivo are ill defined. However, cell culture data indicate that an array of mediators may have mitogenic or antimitogenic effects on these cells. This brief review discusses the relevance of selected factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in this context. In vitro data indicate that \{PDGF\} is one of the most potent mesangial cell mitogens, that it may have autoregulatory properties, and that it may represent the final common pathway for a number of other mitogenic peptides. In contrast to PDGF, the relevance of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) for mesangial cell proliferation is less evident, with growth-inhibitory to weakly growth-promoting effects on mesangial cells. Transforming growth factor ÃŽÂ² (TGFÃŽÂ²) appears to be unique in that it has a concentration-dependent mitogenic or antimitogenic effect on mesangial cells. Prostaglandins may also have variable effects, ranging from mitogenic (PGE2ÃŽÂ±) to growth inhibitory (PGI2, PGF2, TxA2). These data support the notion that mesangial cell growth in vivo is regulated by a complex network of synergistic or antagonistic growth factors. The relative importance of each of these growth factors in the in vivo situation will have to be elucidated by future studies using specific receptor antagonists or neutralizing antibodies. "

Substance P-immunoreactive fibers were seen not only in and around the walls of the hepatic artery, but also in close association with the hepatic veins and bile ducts. Transection of the greater splanchnic nerves and/or the vagus nerves indicated that substance P-immunoreactive fibers in the walls of the portal and hepatic veins enter the liver via both nerves, and that those associated with the hepatic artery and bile ducts stem from the greater splanchnic nerves. The widespread distribution of hepatic substance P and its complex innervation pattern within the liver suggest that it is involved in a variety of physiological processes in this organ. "

In principle, almost every cytokine known so far, including interleukins (IL), interferons (IFN), tumor necrosis factors (TNF), colony stimulating factors (CSF) and several growth factors can be detected in the skin under certain physiological or pathological conditions. There is recent evidence that neuropeptides such as substance P, calcitonin-related gene product (CGRP) a.o. as well as neurohormones such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which is the precursor of several peptidehormones including melanocyte stimulating hormones (MSH), are present in epidermal cells, cutaneous tumors and inflammatory cells infiltrating the skin. In addition to their well known functions as neurotransmitters or hormones, these peptides have recently been recognized as potent immunomodulating agents which inhibit the production and activity of immunoregulatory and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IFNÃŽÂ³) but induce the release of factors, e.g., IL-10, which downregulate immune responses. Accordingly, in animals, ÃŽÂ± \{MSH\} and \{CGRP\} have been shown to inhibit the induction of contact hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, a complex network of interacting mediators including cytokines and neuropeptides within the cutaneous microenvironement are crucial elements of the induction, elicitation and regulation of cutaneous immune responses.

The \{NMDA\} mediated events were calcium dependent and the effects of all excitatory amino acids could be blocked by specific antagonists.

This methodology seeks to overcome some of the inherent limitations of previous experimental investigations by employing novel on-line and in-situ measurement technology coupled with a robust computation of the population and mass balances. In this way models for the performance of hydrocyclone units can be derived and used in the design of more complex networks required for mineral processing. A theoretical treatment to account for the effects of turbulence in small diameter hydrocyclones is also proposed and validated against experimental measurements for conventional and novel geometry hydrocyclones. The potential for integrating such modelling with non-instrusive in-situ instrumentation to enable the air-core and solids concentration profiles within a hydrocyclone to be visualised is also discussed.

Before spore excystment the endosporoplasm became lighter and its typical structures were rendered more visible. Like the endosporoplasm, the liberated amoebula and the uninucleate plasmodia evidenced a similar morphology: spherulosome, haplosporosomes, lipid droplets and mitochondria. During this phase a complex network of microfilaments and microtubules was visible at the periphery of the plasmalemma. Just before the nuclear division of the uninucleate amoebula, the spherulosome membranes seemed to fuse with the amoebula plasmalemma. The spherulosome and haplosporosomes disappear after the binucleate plasmodial stages. "

The present study investigated the effect of insulin on hepatic steroid metabolism in the absence of other hormonal influences by using isolated rat liver cells. Insulin (10Ã¢Ë†â€™9 M) produced two peaks of increased enzyme activity in the hepatocytes (at 12 hr and 24 hr). Dose-response curves at 12 hr and 24 hr insulin preincubation suggest that these two peaks are probably generated by different mechanisms. The absence of any significant changes in cytochrome P-450 content after 12, 1 and 2 hr of insulin treatment indicates that the increase in steroid metabolizing enzyme activities is not due to an increase in de-novo enzyme synthesis. Our observations provide further evidence for the role played by insulin in the regulation of hepatic steroid and drug metabolism in the rat. "

The advent of molecular biology and modern protein microchemistry has led to a rapid expansion of our understanding of the molecular basis of IL-1 action. At present three species of IL-1 and two types of cell surface IL-1 receptors have been identified and cloned. One of the three species of IL-1 appears to be a pure receptor antagonist. In this chapter the current status of our understanding of the molecular basis of IL-1 action is reviewed. "

abstract = {The volumetric properties of five random copolymers have been studied, both experimentally and theoretically, over extended ranges of external conditions of temperature (up to 500 K) and pressure (up to 200 MPa). The experimental measurements have been conducted on a high pressure densitometer (SWO, model PVT100). In copolymers of the type vinyl chloride-co-vinyl acetate, simple linear combining rules are sufficient to describe properly the \{PVT\} behavior by using an equation of state appropriate for copolymers. This, however, is not true in copolymers of the styrene-co-acrylonitrile type where the repeating units are significantly different in size and shape. The combination of our theoretical and experimental approach permitted the assignment of equation of state scaling constants to the fictitious polymer poly(maleic anhydride). This is of importance since maleic anhydride is one of the most widely used repeating units in polymer alloying and blending. The proposed equation of state model also permits the study of systems of the type styrene-co-vinyl phenol, in which a highly complex network of hydrogen bonding is involved. "

Our results indicate that Exp1 (a 23-kDa protein marker of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane and intraerythrocytic loops) concentrates in membrane domains on the periphery of the parasite and in the tubovesicular membrane network. In contrast, a 45-kDa protein localized to the MaurerÃ¢â‚¬Â²s clefts is distributed in punctate domains along lipid labeled tubovesicular membranes, frequently along the periphery of the network juxtaposed to the red cell membrane.

Many exciting advances have been made recently in understanding the molecular mechanism by which these receptor proteins operate.

In addition, RXRs, in the presence of their specific ligands such as 9-cis RA, can form homodimers that recognize a subset of retinoic acid responsive elements (RAREs). The retinoid responses mediated by \{RXR\} homodimers and RAR-RXR heterodimers can be restricted by the COUP-TF orphan receptors that bind strongly to certain \{RAREs\} as homodimers.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a versatile process that excises bulky base modifications from DNA. To study the substrate range of this system, we constructed bulky deoxyribose adducts that do not affect the chemistry of the corresponding bases. These novel adducts were incorporated into double-stranded \{DNA\} in a site-specific manner and the repair of the modified sites was investigated. Results: Using restriction enzymes as a probe for \{DNA\} modification, we confirmed that the resulting substrates contained the bulky deoxyribose adducts at the expected position. \{DNA\} containing these unique adducts did not stimulate \{DNA\} repair synthesis when mixed with an NER-competent human cell extract. Inefficient repair of deoxyribose adducts was confirmed by monitoring the release of single-stranded oligonucleotides during the excision reaction that precedes \{DNA\} repair synthesis. As a control, the same human cell extract was able to process a base adduct of comparable size. Conclusions: Our results indicate that modification of \{DNA\} bases rather than disruption of the sugar-phosphate backbone is an important determinant for damage recognition by the human \{NER\} system. Specific positions in \{DNA\} may thus be modified without eliciting \{NER\} responses. This observation suggests new strategies for anticancer drug design to generate \{DNA\} modifications that are refractory to repair processes. "

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the importance of plasma membrane proteins in carrying out numerous cellular functions at the interface between the internal and external environments. The plasma membrane is actively involved in the uptake by endocytosis of a variety of materials from the surrounding medium. The most extensively studied aspect of endocytosis is receptor-mediated endocytosis, which takes place at small specialized sites that are readily recognized as coated pits by a bristle-like thickening on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. The membrane coat-material is the protein clathrin, which forms a complex network of pentagons and hexagons on the surface of the plasma membrane. After the coated pits are invaginated and pinched off, the clathrin is removed from the vesicle by an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), which belongs to the family of 70-kD heat-shock proteins. The fate of the receptors and the bound ligands in the endocytosed vesicles is conditioned by the nature of the materials taken up by the cell. The best-studied example is the endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which carry cholesterol into liver cells and other types of cells. The fusion of membranes in endocytosis and exocytosis is dependent upon the interactions between membrane proteins and an intermixing of membrane lipids. Annexins, which constitute a family of proteins containing highly conserved Ca2+-binding repeats, are thought to facilitate close contacts among membranes destined to undergo fusion. "

These studies demonstrated the existence of complex cytokine networks by which inflammatory cells regulate fibroblast function and fibroblasts, in turn, feed back to regulate inflammatory cell function. They also demonstrated that, in this complex network, the effect of an individual cytokine varies with the state of activation of the target cell, the presence of other cytokines in the local microenvironment, and the ability of the target cell to produce bioactive autocoids such as prostaglandins. Aspects of this cytokine network are discussed and a testable hypothesis for granuloma and abscess formation is detailed. "

The mathematics of coupling follows the work of Oskar Lange in which a general mode of mathematical description for all networks is developed, through the use of matrix algebra. Two simple examples are developed in the paper which are soluble without computer assistance. However, the greatest advantage of the technique is its compactness of notation and the ability to extend the technique to large and complex networks. "

IgE-bearing epidermal dendritic cells were present in patients with elevated IgE serum level (&gt;300 UI/mI) and the staining pattern was stronger in lesional skin. On double immunostaining, a subpopulation of CD1a+ LC/IC was found not to bear IgE molecules as determined by the ratio IgE+/CD1a+ cells on serial sections as well. The ratio IgE+/CD1a+ cells decreased in patients who underwent a local therapy with glucocorticosteroids. These results suggest that the expression of IgE receptors and/or binding of IgE molecules on epidermal LC/IC in atopic eczema may be controlled by a complex network of mediators from the epidermis or the inflammatory infiltrate, or both, and that this phenomenon could be down regulated by glucocorticosteroids.

Detailed structural analysis of the fracture population indicates that fractures are grouped in two principal fractures sets striking \{N005\} and \{N170\} Ã‚Â°, and dipping 70 Ã‚Â°W and 70 Ã‚Â°E, respectively. This average attitude is closely related to the past tectonic rifting activity of the graben during the Tertiary, and is consistent with data obtained from nearby boreholes and from neighbouring crystalline outcrops. Fractures are distributed in clusters of hydrothermally altered and fractured zones. They constitute a complex network of fault strands dominated by NÃ¢â‚¬â€œS trends, except within some of the most fractured depth intervals (1650 m, 2170 m), where an EÃ¢â‚¬â€œW-striking fracture set occurs. The geometry of the pre-existing fracture system strikes in a direction nearly parallel to the maximum horizontal stress. In this favorable situation, hydraulic injections will tend both to reactivate natural fractures at low pressures, and to create a geothermal reservoir. "

This chapter describes Cuulobucter crescentus for discussion as an example of a bacterium, with an extensively studied developmental cycle that is independent of environmental stress. The ease of synchronization and amenability to the genetic analysis of C. crescentus have allowed significant strides to be made in understanding the forces that drive its obligate developmental cycle. Development takes on many forms among the bacteria, from a natural part of the cell cycle as seen in C. crescentus to the sporulation pathways, initiated by stress in a variety of other organisms. Developmental programs are evident even in the prototypical bacterium of molecular biology, E .coli, as it responds to stress and enters or exits the stationary phase. Dissection of the factors, driving these programs in several different bacteria, is well underway, revealing in each case a complex network of signals temporally and spatially controlling gene expression. As the components, regulating development in bacteria, are understood at a molecular level, this fundamental knowledge should illuminate the basic principles that extend beyond the prokaryotic kingdom to aid in the understanding of the developmental processes in a variety of other organisms.

The method does not use ad hoc procedures to treat special situations. After a brief review of the basic model for one link, the article describes how three-legged junctions can be modeled. It then introduces a numerical procedure for networks, assuming that a time-varying origin-destination (O-D) table is given and that the proportion of turns at every junction is known. These assumptions are reasonable for numerical analysis of disaster evacuation plans. The results are then extended to the case where, instead of the turning proportions, the best routes to each destination from every junction are known at all times. For technical reasons explained in the text, the procedure is more complicated in this case, requiring more computer memory and more time for execution. The effort is estimated to be about an order of magnitude greater than for the static traffic assignment problem on a network of the same size. The procedure is ideally suited for parallel computing. It is hoped that the results in the article will lead to more realistic models of freeway flow, disaster evacuations and dynamic traffic assignment for the evening commute. "

Large quantities of data can be obtained from mapping studies, but computational techniques are needed to make sense of the complex network interactions that take place in the brain. Structural equation modeling may provide such a technique by combining the anatomical connectivity with the covariation in the activity between brain regions. Functional strengths of anatomical connections between the structures that form a neural network can be quantified by assigning numerical values to the links. Changes in these values are used as indices of how information is processed and modified within the brain in a given situation. We used brain metabolic data from auditory learning experiments to explain how structural models of the auditory system reveal the patterns of network interactions related to opposite learned associative properties of the same sound. This analysis supports the hypothesis that associative learning is an emergent network property, distributed among interacting brain regions. Understanding such a property requires a network analysis of the patterns of interactions between brain regions, rather than the traditional analysis of regions one at a time. "

Occasionally, single axon terminals with \{NPY\} were found in the vicinity of or in contact with hepatic cells. There was a small number of \{NPY\} fibers that had lost their glial sheaths while running toward lymphatic capillaries. These findings suggest that hepatic \{NPY\} arises from the celiac ganglion and paravertebral sympathetic ganglia, and that it is involved in more complex physiological processes than the previously neuropeptides in the liver, which are localized exclusively to hepatic vessel walls.

Various techniques were tested for reshaping the two-dimensional responses to remove the long dispersion-mode tails, and to emphasize cross-peaks at the expense of diagonal peaks. Operation with a mixing pulse of relatively small flip angle allows relative signs of coupling constants to be determined by inspection of the two-dimensional spectrum. Weak long-range couplings, normally hidden within the linewidth, may be detected, although their magnitudes can only be estimated very approximately. A simple modification of the pulse sequence permits broadband decoupling in one frequency dimension, giving proton spectra without any J splittings. "

Often the resolution of the conflicting goals is to require a stockpile of finished goods to hold large amounts of inventory. The two functional areas thus are buffered. It is our opinion that an integrated view of the entire production-distribution system may generate significant savings by trading off the costs associated with the whole, rather than minimizing production and distribution costs separately. In this paper we develop a model of an integrated production-distribution system comprised of a single station model of a factory, a stockpile of finished goods, and a single retailer. The concepts and solution methodology, however, show promise for more complex networks. Multiple products with stochastic, independent demand are produced at the factory, stored at FG, and distributed to the retailer where demand is met or backlogged. In addition, \{FG\} may order an expedite batch of a particular product if its stock level decreases to a specified expedite reorder point. Expedite batches have nonpreemptive priority over normal replenishment batches. We approximate the distributions of key random variables to compute costs and service levels for all products across the supply chain. We find that our approximations are often quite accurate. Our limited tests of the performance of the near-optimization algorithm indicate that it provides solutions very close to the optimal. We also provide results that yield insight into the behavior of this integrated system. "

To date the application of information techniques has focused mainly on the description of flows averaged over a certain interval of time and space. However, the prominent feature of self-organizing systems is provided by patterns along the spatial and temporal dimensions. By resolving the structure of flows in space and time and quantifying their spatiotemporal organization, one obtains a more comprehensive measure to characterize the development of a system. Introduction of a symmetric reference state into the information theoretical description results in a sensitive measure to quantify functional changes associated with certain spatiotemporal patterns. This is demonstrated in a variety of model networks, including a simple reaction-diffusion model known as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brusselator.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The method allows one to distinguish between exogeneous and endogeneous contributions to the systems' organization.

The Al-rich areas contain Ca-Al-rich clinopyroxenes, a Na-Ca-silica-rich phase, Fe-rich olivine, and Al-rich enstatite. Some clinopyroxenes contain up to 12.9 wt% \{A12O3\} and 5.4 wt% TiO2, resembling the fassaite that is common in Ca-Al-rich refractory inclusions in \{CV\} chondrites. The internal regions probably consist of intimate mixtures of carbonaceous material and extremely small particles rich in S, Fe-S, Al, and Si. The elements that occur in the internal regions (S, Fe, Al, Ca, and Na) are those that are strongly depleted in ureilites relative to carbonaceous chondrites. The presence of those elements in the C-vein suggests that the internal materials are remnants of drain channels for the depleted elements produced during formation process of ureilites from carbonaceous chondrites. Those elements were probably mobilized under high temperature and pressure generated by shock impacts and escaped as mixtures of liquids and vapor through fissures produced within mechanically weak C-veins. The Ti-rich fassaite may be a remnant of the CV-chondrite-like material. The C-vein provides evidence that ureilites resulted from preferential melting and recrystallization of carbonaceous chondrites by a temperature-gradient zone refining process during a planetesimal-scale collision or collisions.

Tumor necrosis factor-ÃŽÂ± (TNF-ÃŽÂ±) and IL-10 act as autocrine regulators in the induction of the enzyme NO-synthase. Both cytokines are produced by macrophages stimulated with IFN-ÃŽÂ³ and infected with M. bovis.

abstract = {Background: The mammalian brain consists of the cerebral cortical sheet, which is composed of many distinct areas, the cerebellar cortex, and many non-cortical nuclei. Powerful neuroanatomical techniques have revealed a large number of connections between these structures. The large number of brain structures and the very many connections between them form a strikingly complex network. The complexity of this network has made it difficult to understand how the central nervous system is organized. Recently, however, optimization analysis of an important subset of central nervous connections that occur between the different areas of the cerebral cortex has produced understandable and quantitative representations of the organization of cortical systems of the primate brain. Results: Here we briefly report the extension of this approach to the cortical systems of the cat. There were four connectional clusters of cortical areas in the cat. These clusters of areas corresponded to the visual, auditory, and somato-motor systems, and to the frontal and limbic areas, which we call the fronto-limbic complex. All the major sensory systems were hierarchically organized, and their Ã¢â‚¬ËœhigherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stations were more closely associated with the fronto-limbic complex than were their Ã¢â‚¬ËœlowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stations. Conclusions: Features of the organization of the cat brain, together with earlier primate results, suggest that there may be a common cortical plan in mammals. We suggest that this common plan may involve relatively discrete, hierarchically organized, cortical sensory systems and a topologically central fronto-limbic complex. Specific variations on this wiring plan may relate to evolutionary history and selection for particular ecological niches. "

abstract = {Summary The study of cytokines that regulate all areas of cellular communication has expanded over the past few years. The control and modulation of the complex network of cytokine action remains an area of intense interest. Agents that will modulate cytokine signal transduction at the cellular level will assist in the understanding of the molecular basis of cytokine cellular activation and in the design of drugs for the management of clinical disease. Recent work has demonstrated the existence of complex mechanisms of negative regulation of cytokine action. New methods utilizing isolated protein products that participate in immunomodulation may prove useful for clinical regulation of the host response to cytokine up-regulation. Currently, most interest in soluble cytokine receptors, natural cytokine inhibitors, genetically engineered cytokine antagonists and single or combinations of anti-inflammatory cytokines has focused on the possibility that they may become standard pharmacological agents for the treatment of inflammatory complications of clinical disease. Specifically, \{TNF\} and IL-1 inhibitors and the cytokines IL-10 and TGF-ÃŽÂ², alone or in combination may be effective for the inhibition of severe clinical inflammation. Soluble receptors for other cytokines such as IL-6 may prove to be carrier proteins that enhance cytokine action and will require cautious investigation. Because most cytokines are pleiomorphic in their activities, down-regulation through the utilization of direct inhibitors or anti-inflammatory cytokines may cause immunosuppression, making the host susceptible to opportunistic infection. Selective and short-term inhibition of inflammatory cytokine action may be necessary to prevent unwanted clinical side-effects. "

In addition, a number of studies have revealed a complex network of RNA-RNA interactions in the spliceosome, strengthening the structural and functional parallels between nuclear pre-mRNA splicing and the self-splicing group I and group \{II\} introns. These new data further support the idea that pre-mRNA splicing occurs by RNA-mediated catalysis and illustrate quite dramatically the dynamic nature of conformational changes in the spliceosome cycle. With respect to tissue-specific pre-mRNA splicing, a number of studies have begun to illuminate mechanisms underlying control of splice-site selection and how so-called Ã¢â‚¬ËœgeneralÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RNA-binding proteins, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, may be involved in determining different splicing patterns. Finally, an emerging theme involving the role of splicing in development is that differential transcriptional programs can be triggered in different cell types by alternative splicing patterns that generate transcription factor isoforms with different activities or DNA-binding specificities.

A grafted cascade on a loop destroys the typical behaviour of the loop if the cascade is a negative chain grafted with an \{AND\} or a positive chain grafted with an \{OR\} connection; the system then admits only one stable state. Grafting a negative chain with an \{OR\} or a positive chain with an \{AND\} connection leaves the general behaviour of the loop unaffected.

Postmitotic brain cell does not replicate its genome and has lower levels of several \{DNA\} repair enzymes. This could impair the \{DNA\} repair capacity and render the nervous system prone to the accumulation of \{DNA\} lesions. Some human diseases clearly characterized by a \{DNA\} repair deficiency, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, atexia-telangiectasia and Cockayne syndrome, show neurodegeneration as one of the main clinical and pathological features. On the other hand there is evidence that some diseases characterized by primary neuronal degeneration (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer disease) may have alterations in the \{DNA\} repair system as well. \{DNA\} repair thus appears important to maintain the functional integrity of the nervous system and an accumulation of \{DNA\} damages in neurons as a result of impaired \{DNA\} repair mechanisms may lead to neuronal degenerations.

In electron micrographs of kinetoplast \{DNA\} spread in a protein monolayer we have identified four types of network with the appearance of different stages in network replication and segregation. We show that each network type has characteristic properties with respect to shape, size, number, and location of maxicircle loops and nicked or covalently closed character of minicircles and maxicircles. We propose a detailed model for network segregation that involves a gradual elongation of the network, followed by network cleavage. During this process the basic network structure remains unaltered, implying a complicated mechanism of minicircle rearrangements. "

A 3 year study of the fair weather and storm flow and sediment dynamics within the tidal channel network revealed that the channels could be placed into two fundamental hydraulically based groups: through-flowing and dead-end. A classification for low-mesotidal tidal channels is proposed. The first group (through-flowing channels) act as conduits and are composed of two types with different functions, which either: (1) connect the ocean to the lagoon or, (2) connect two tidal channels. The second group (branching dead-ending channels) terminate in the salt marsh. Each of the three types are distinct and can be distinguished by a set of physical and hydrodynamic characteristics. Their importance varies during the evolution of the back-barrier setting when the environment changes from predominantly open water to predominantly salt marsh. Through-flowing channels apparently have a more prominent role during early stages of salt marsh development, whereas dead-end channels become increasingly important with time and dominate in the late stages when little open water remains.

In this symposium summary, an overview of critical aspects of neutrophil-dependent liver injury is presented. A general introduction to the involvement of adhesion molecules in neutrophil rolling and transendothelial migration is provided. Mediators and mechanisms of neutrophil sequestration in the liver vasculature, extravasation, and adherence-dependent cytotoxicity are discussed using the examples of endotoxin-induced hepatic failure and ischemia-reperfusion injury. These processes involve a complex network of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, and lipid-derived compounds. The role of neutrophil-derived cytotoxic mediators, e.g., reactive oxygen and proteases, in the molecular mechanisms of parenchymal cell injury is discussed.

Anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies inhibited the response of the anti-Mx9/9 clones, suggesting that these clones recognize their target antigen in association with HLA-DR.

The \{ECM\} fibrils, which are largely used as substratum for locomotion by the crest cells, have a temporally and regionally specific organization and distribution. Increase in \{ECM\} fibrils on the neural tube, ahead of the crest cell front, is correlated with initiation of crest cell emigration, and it is suggested that the fibrils may stimulate this process by providing a suitable substratum for cell locomotion. An increase in \{ECM\} fibrils in extracellular spaces surrounding the crest cell population is correlated with an expansion of these spaces and with progressing crest cell migration into them. It is proposed that the spatial organization of the \{ECM\} fibrils influences crest cell shape and orientation during early migration. "

In stochastic neuronal models, the interspike interval corresponds to the time period during which the process imitating the membrane potential reaches a threshold for the first time from a reset depolarization. For neurons belonging to complex networks in the brain, stochastic diffusion processes are often used to approximate the time course of the membrane potential. The interspike interval is then viewed as the first passage time for the employed diffusion process. Due to a lack of analytical solution for the related first passage time problem for most diffusion neuronal models, a numerical integration method, which serves to compute first passage time moments on the basis of the Siegert recursive formula, is presented in this paper. For their neurobiological plausibility, the method here is associated with diffusion processes whose state spaces are restricted to finite intervals, but it can also be applied to other diffusion processes and in other (non-neuronal) contexts. The capability of the method is demonstrated in numerical examples and the relation between the integration step, accuracy of calculation and amount of computing time required is discussed. "

This review presents an overview of the function and expression of both types of enzymes with emphasis on steroidogenic P450s. The final part of the review on regulation of steroidogenesis includes a description of the normal physiological fluctuations in the steroid output of adrenal cortex and gonads, and provides an analysis of the relative role of enzyme levels in the determination of these fluctuations. The repertoire of enzymes expressed in a steroidogenic cell matches the cell's capacity for the biosynthesis of specific steroids. Thus, steroidogenic capacity is regulated mainly by tissue and cell specific expression of enzymes, and not by selective activation or inhibition of enzymes from a larger repertoire. The quantitative capacity of steroidogenic cells for the biosynthesis of specific steroids is determined by the levels of steroidogenic enzymes. The major physiological variations in enzyme levels, are generally associated with parallel changes in gene expression. The level of expression of each steroidogenic enzyme varies in three characteristics: (a) tissue- and cell-specific expression, determined during tissue and cell differentiation; (b) basal expression, in the absence of trophic hormonal stimulation; and (c) hormonal signal regulated expression. Each of these three types of expression probably represent the functioning of distinct gene regulatory elements. In adult steroidogenic tissues, the levels of most of the cell- and tissue-specific steroidogenic enzymes depend mainly on trophic hormonal stimulation mediated by a complex network of signal transduction systems.

This chapter describes the physiology of graft-host interactions in the rat hippocampus. The chapter also addresses two main questions that guide the research on the physiology of graft-host interactions, (1) can the graft substitute for the damaged host tissue, be incorporated into host circuits and function as expected of a normal host tissue; and (2) can the graft serve as a simple model system for asking questions relevant to normal brain operation. Independent of the possible restoration of functions, the graft can be used as a simple model for complex networks in the brain. The chapter indicates that given the existing limitation of resolution of electrophysiological techniques in the in vitro slice preparation, the heterogeneity of grafted tissue and synapse formation with selective populations of host neurons, the graft should be useful for examining basic questions relevant to central neurotransmission.

They are composed predominantly of packstones and wackestones, but grainstones and boundstones also occur. Uplift and exposure of the reef occurred during deposition. This, together with burial, resulted in dissolution of bioclasts, precipitation of meniscus and blocky spar cements, extensive fissuring of the rock and filling of the fissures by internal sediment, predominantly carbonate silts. The meniscus cements are unusual in that they occur mostly within biomouldic pores, particularly after corals. The meniscus form of the cement may be a result of air bubbles trapped within the complex pore-system formed from the dissolution of corals. The fissures, which are probably a product of fracturing associated with local fault movements, form complex networks linking biomouldic pores. Carbonate internal sediments, mostly crystal silt but also pelleted, which form thin graded layers in places, completely fill the fissures and adjacent biomouldic pores. These features, in association with bioclasts dissolution and meniscus cements, suggest a vadose origin. This interpretation is supported by the variation in the Ã�Âµ180 and Ã�Âµ130 stable isotope values of the internal sediment compared with the depositional matrix. Equant sparry calcite cements are locally extensive. On the basis of only moderately depleted Ã�Âµ80 values and elevated strontium values they are tentatively interpreted to be of marine phreatic origin. "

Essential to the maintenance and function of the immune-endocrine circuitry are an array of chemical mediators produced by cells of the immune and endocrine systems. Cytokines are glycoproteins (molecular masses of 15,000-20,000) that are elaborated by antigen-activated immune cells and responsible for orchestrating immune cellular activities. These inflammatory mediators also affect the functioning of the neuroendocrine system. Thus, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-ÃŽÂ± and interferon-ÃŽÂ³ affect the secretion of hypothalamic and anterior pituitary hormones in vitro and in vivo, and specific high-affinity receptors for IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6 have been identified in neuroendocrine tissues. A paracrine role for these factors in the regulation of neuroendocrine function may be advanced because certain of these mediators (e.g., IL-1, IL-6) are present in the hypothalamus as well as the anterior and neurointermediate lobes of the pituitary. The production of these cytokines in neuroendocrine cells is enhanced by neuropeptides, endotoxin, and other cytokines. We propose that the local neuroendocrine cytokinergic tone may act in a facilitative manner to enhance the secretion of hypothalamic-pituitary hormones. "

The process of moulting in Collembola consists of identical cycles. The characteristic sequences of each moulting cycle, specific to Collembola, are the secretion of moulting granules and the presence of blood cells within the ecdysial space. The moulting granules are elaborated and stocked in the cells, which produce the scales and the setae. The evacuation of these granules in the ecdysial space occurs at the time of the detachment of the cuticle. Hemocytes, observed in the epidermis, enter the ecdysial space at this time. The part played by the moulting granules and the hemocytes is still unknown; they might be involved in the process of cuticular digestion. "

abstract = {The NW-SE oriented Sole Pit High, located in the western half of the Southern North Sea Basin, is the result of three different structural processes initiated during the Late Palaeozoic. Basin subsidence, probably related to Late Hercynian pull-apart movements, led to continuous sedimentation from the Permian to the Middle Jurassic. Mid-Jurassic doming of its eastern flank, followed by erosion, transtensional movements and differential subsidence until the Early Cretaceous, reflect the Mid and Late Kimmerian crustal distension and fragmentation of the North Sea Rift. Basinwide inversion occurred between the Turonian and the Campanian and was repeated in the Oligocene resulting in a total uplift of some 1500 m. The present structural style is represented by a complex network of transpressional and transtensional faults at Permian Rotliegend levels, which are thought to represent the upward termination of a series of wrench-induced flower structures with a right-lateral sense of displacement. These faults are detached by Zechstein and Triassic salt from more orderly transtensional faults systems at shallower levels. In areas where salt is absent Late Kimmerian normal faults became reactivated in a reverse sense during inversion. However, the relationship of these shallow mappable tectonic components to the deeper pre-Permian structure of the Sole Pit High and to the underlying crustal configuration remains speculative. "

Two distinct types of glands are present in the anterior region of the miracidium, viz. a large, syncytial apical gland and a single pair of small, unicellular lateral glands. The apical papilla is formed by the bounding membrane of the apical gland, which is elevated into a complex network of anastomosing lamellae. The lateral glands terminate in discrete rosetteshaped areas on the apical papilla. The possible function of glands in digenetic miracidia and the nature of their secretions are discussed. "

The present investigation reveals a complex network of interactions between antibodies directed against distinct nonoverlapping epitopes leading to enhanced binding of certain antibodies in the presence of bound second antibodies. The enhancement between antibody pairs can be either unidirectional or bidirectional. In addition, there are domains of predilection, which bind enhanceable antibodies (domain A) whereas others bind antibodies which preferentially induce enhancement (domain B). These domains represent structurally unrelated entities, domain A being sensitive to denaturation and fragmentation and domain B being resistant. Quantitative evaluation of binding data by Scatchard analysis revealed that the observed enhancement phenomenon is due to a two- to sixfold increase of antibody avidity. In the system described, enhancement of antibody binding is not dependent on antibody bivalency since it could also be demonstrated with purified Fab fragments acting either as enhanced or as enhancing antibody. It is therefore concluded that binding of antibodies to certain epitopes on the \{TBE\} virus glycoprotein induces conformational changes in distant parts of the molecule which can result in increased avidity of antibodies directed to conformationally changed epitopes. A possible explanation for the origin of this enhancement phenomenon is presented. "

We can thus study the emergence of the major transitions during cellular evolution, and resolve some of the controversies surrounding the evolutionary status of archaea and the origins of the eukaryotic cell. In view of the ongoing projects that sequence the complete genomes of several Archaea, this work forms a testable prediction when the genome sequences become available. Using the presence of the protein families as taxonomic traits, and linking them to biochemical pathways, we are able to reason about the presence of the corresponding cellular processes in the last universal ancestor of contemporary cells. The analysis shows that metabolism was already a complex network of reactions which included amino acid, nucleotide, fatty acid, sugar and coenzyme metabolism. In addition, genetic processes such as translation are conserved and close to the original form. However, other processes such as \{DNA\} replication and repair or transcription are exceptional and seem to be associated with the structural changes that drove eukaryotes and bacteria away from their common ancestor. There are two major hypotheses in the present work: first, that archaea are probably closer to the last universal ancestor than any other extant life form, and second, that the major cellular processes were in place before the major splitting. The last universal ancestor had metabolism and translation very similar to the contemporary ones, while having an operonic genome organization and archaean-like transcription. Evidently, all cells today contain remnants of the primordial genome of the last universal ancestor. "

The variety of behaviour exhibited by this system, under different conditions, includes steady state, simple limit cycle oscillations, complex oscillations and period bifurcations leading to random oscillations or chaos. The system also shows the existence of two distinct chaotic regimes under the variation of a single parameter. These results, in comparison with single biochemical control loops, show that new behaviours can be exhibited in a more complex network which are not seen in the single control loops. The results are discussed in the light of a diverse variety of cellular functions in normal and altered cells indicating the role of controlled metabolic network as the underlying basis for cellular behaviour.

These connections turned out to be part of a parallel network reciprocally linking sensory structures to cortical and subcortical formations that, from anatomical and electrophysiological investigations, appear to be involved in the neural control of directionally oriented eye movements, as well as in the orientation of visual attention. In the macaque monkey, the caudal half of the \{STS\} is an important cortical station of the extrageniculo-striate visual system in which discrete visual areas have been identified. Among these, the \{MT\} area is reputed to play a key role in visual motion analysis because of the property of its neurons to selectively respond to the direction and speed of moving visual stimuli. Areas surrounding \{MT\} are less defined as to their anatomical limits, connections, and functions. The pieces of evidence highlighted in this chapter suggest that the extrageniculo-striate corticothalamic system involving the superior temporal cortex is an intimate part of a complex network of functional units.

Experiments were done using acutely dissected or organ cultured parasympathetic cardiac ganglion preparations from Necturus maculosus (mudpuppy). The glyoxylic acid-induced fluorescence technique was used to visualize catecholamine-containing cells and fibers. Numerous long brightly fluorescent varicose fibers form a complex network over clusters of parasympathetic ganglion cells and strands of cardiac muscle. In addition to these fibers, there are numerous small brightly fluorescent interneurons (SIF cells) interspersed between individual parasympathetic ganglion cells. Long fibers and processes from the interneurons join to form bundles which arborize over groups of parasympathetic cells. In peripherally located smaller groups of ganglion cells there are no interneurons, but some of these parasympathetic cells appear to receive innervation from the long continuous fluorescent axons. Two experimental procedures were applied to support the conclusion that these long fibers were indeed sympathetic postganglionic axons: (a) explants of cardiac ganglia were maintained for varying times to produce degeneration of any severed axons: (b) chemical sympathectomy was produced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. The intrinsic \{SIF\} cells were apparently unaffected by both procedures. After 8 days in culture or after 6-OH dopamine treatment, all of the long continuous brightly fluorescent fibers, which normally intermingle with clusters of ganglion cells or innervate cardiac muscle, were absent. This indicates their extra-ganglionic origin. All of the isolated groups of parasympathetic ganglion cells not containing \{SIF\} cells were totally devoid of any catecholamine-containing fibers. "

Fractal geometry provides one synthetic key to the description of classical geostatistical tools such as variograms. Spatial structures of soil properties of each of the three topsoil pedological units were mostly characterized along the slope by the ranges of the fractal one-dimensional space domains and their scale invariants: the fractal dimensions. Results suggest that, within each topsoil pedological unit, these scale invariants are relevant qualifiers of the intrinsic topsoil variability, which can be modelled as a fractal Brownian process and should be incorporated in simple recursive or complex network soil erosion models. Different surface fractal dimensions, in a one-dimensional space, have been found within these three topsoil units for each soil parameter studied (multifractals). All the data have been aggregated within the whole one-dimensional slope transect in order to obtain both possible general scale laws on clays and other soil characteristics and possible evidence concerning underlying soil erosion mechanisms by particle runoff.

For each step in a biological or electrical network, flow is dependent on the driving force and the conductivity of the step. The relationship between biological flows and their driving forces can therefore be expressed as relationships between analogous currents and voltages. The time dependence of approach to equilibrium or a steady state is determined by the rates of depletion of material in various compartments. Electrical capacitance is therefore analogous to compartment volume. Once these generalized concepts of flow, force and capacitance are recognized, it becomes clear that computer programs designed for analysis of electrical circuits may be used for simulation of biological networks. A set of simple mathematical descriptions of the individual steps and a diagram showing how the steps are arranged with respect to each other are all that is necessary to perform a simulation; there is no need for computer programming skills or differential equations. The use of \{SPICE2\} for simulation of the cellular and plasma pharmacokinetics of cytosine arabinoside (araC) is described as an example.

By using electron-opaque tracers such as horseradish peroxidase and lanthanum chloride, we demonstrated that the follicle is constituted of two distinct compartments: the apical and basal compartments. The apical compartment containing the young germ cells is readily penetrated by the tracers while the basal one, containing the differentiating germ cells, is tightly closed. In the apical region the tracers permeate the intercellular spaces of the somatic envelopes, perifollicular cell layer and cyst envelopes, and reach the most internal germ cells. In the basal compartment, a new tissue develops under the perifollicular layer: the inner parietal cell layer. This tissue is constituted of cells displaying long, overlapping processes forming a complex network of intercellular spaces along which extensive septate junctions are found. The tracers permeate the perifollicular cell layer and enter the inner parietal layer but they are stopped before they can traverse it fully. They do not cross the totality of the septate junctions which appear, therefore, to be the main structures restricting the entry of the tracers.

A first cycle of viral multiplication was observed in a subpopulation of receptor cells scattered in the main olfactory epithelium and in the septal organ. No viral spread from cell body to cell body was reported even in later stages of infection. The second round of viral replication which took place in the ipsilateral main olfactory bulb at 2 and 2.5 days post-inoculation (p.i.), involved second order neurons and periglomerular cells, known to be directly connected with the axon terminals of receptor cells. Also reported as a result of a second cycle of viral replication, was surprisingly the spread of \{CVS\} at 2 and 2.5 days p.i. in bulbar interneurons located in the internal plexiform layer and in the superficial granule cell layer, as well as that of 2 ipsilateral cerebral nuclei, the anterior olfactory nucleus and the horizontal limb of the diagonal band. From day 3, a rapid spread of \{CVS\} was suggested by detection of virus in all ipsilateral direct terminal regions of the second order neurons and in most tertiary olfactory projections. The locus coeruleus, a noradrenergic nucleus which sends direct afferents to the olfactory bulb, never appeared immunoreactive. In spite of a certaine inability of \{CVS\} to infect some neuron types, the virus appears relevant to provide new information regarding the complex network of olfactory-related neurons into the CNS.

abstract = {A new series of thermosetting resins were prepared from the reaction of diaminomaleonitrile (DAM) with 4,4Ã¢â‚¬Â²-bismaleimidediphenylmethane (BM) under various molar ratios. The resins were characterized by FT-IR, DTA, \{TGA\} and TMA. They had a complex network structure depending on their composition. The \{DTA\} studies revealed that their crosslinking started at about 40 Ã‚Â°C below the temperature required for crosslinking of BM. Their thermal stability was correlated with their composition and the curing conditions. The cured resins obtained upon curing at 300 Ã‚Â°C for 60 h were remarkably more thermally stable than \{BM\} which cured itself under the same conditions. They were stable up to 326Ã¢â‚¬â€œ377 Ã‚Â°C and afforded an anaerobic char yield of 56Ã¢â‚¬â€œ72% at 800 Ã‚Â°C. Prior to pyrolysis, most of the resins were of amorphous structure, and behaved electrically, at room temperature, as insulators. A decrease of the electrical resistivity was observed with increasing pyrolysis temperature. All resulting conductive materials were of amorphous structure as revealed by their X-ray diffraction profiles. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity was measured in the temperature range Ã¢Ë†â€™173Ã¢â‚¬â€œ327 Ã‚Â°C (100Ã¢â‚¬â€œ600K) for all pyrolysed materials. The results suggest semiconducting properties. The thermally activated conduction model, as well as the variable range hopping model, were applied in order to interpret the experimental data. The observed electrical conductivity seems to be thermally activated and could be associated with intermolecular and intramolecular hopping conduction processes. The activation energies for the intermolecular process ranges from 0.249 to 0.018 and 0.387 to 0.059 eV for the intramolecular process depending on the pyrolysis temperature. The electrical behaviour of all conductive materials could be easily controlled from insulating to semiconducting by controlling both the pyrolysis temperature and duration. The highest electrical conductivity of 1.98 Ãƒâ€” 101 S cmÃ¢Ë†â€™1 was observed for a conductive material pyrolysed at 800 Ã‚Â°C for 40 h. "

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) control the cell cycle in all eukaryotes, whereas other proteins, known as cyclins, act as their regulatory subunits. Chronic injection with isoproterenol (ISO) can induce acinar cell proliferation in rodent salivary glands. Cyclins and \{CDK\} proteins from control and ISO-treated murine parotid acinar cells were detected by using Western blotting techniques. By comparing the expression of these cell cycle regulatory kinases in the parotid acinar cell transition from a quiescent state to a hypertrophic state, we found rapid increases in the protein levels of all CDKs, cyclin D and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The highest protein levels for \{CDKs\} and cyclins appeared at about 72 hr of \{ISO\} stimulation and were coincident with the highest rate of increase in gland wet weight. After 72 hr, the increase of both cell cycle protein and gland wet weight began to subside. By using a co-immunoprecipitation method, the following cell cycle regulators (CDK-cyclin complexes) were detected, CDK4-cyclin D, CDK2-cyclin E, CDK2-cyclin A, and cdc2-cyclin B, along with an increase in kinase activity over control untreated animals. Additionally, we detected significant decreases in the newly isolated \{CDK\} inhibitor (CKI) p27kip but not Wee 1 kinase. The increased levels of \{CKI\} correlated with a decrease in kinase activity of CDK/cyclin complexes by 144 hr of chronic isoproterenol treatment. Our data suggest that the holoenzymes for cell cycle control (cyclin-CDK complexes) function as a final regulatory mechanism leading to salivary gland acinar cell proliferation. The gradual decline in protein levels of the \{CDKs\} and cyclins after 3 days of chronic treatment further indicates that ISO-induced proliferation of parotid acinar cells is self-limiting and non-tumorigenic.

This segment lies above the flat-slab subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the Andes. The surface of these basins shows a complex network of present-day rivers and fossil river traces. A relative chronology of the river traces deduced from morphological criteria allows the identification of successive shifting of fluvial belts up to the present position of the main rivers. As it enters the Ucamara Depression, the Ucayali River is deflected to the northeast. Successive shifts of the deflection point are directed upstream along the upper reaches of the river along the foothills. Simultaneously the MaraÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³n River is deflected to the north, lining up with the straight, NE-trending lower reaches of the Huallaga River. In the central part of the depression the rivers trend northeast-southwest, parallel to the main strike of the basement faults. This regional trend is also parallel to (1) the greatest principal stress observed both to the east and the west of the depression, and to (2) the neotectonic faults on the margin of the Brazilian craton. The Beni Basin is characterized by a counterclockwise shift of the Beni River. Successive shifts of the river involve the northward migration of the deflection point of the Beni River as it enters the basin. A fault connected to the foothill margin controls this downstream movement. Recent erosion of the flood plain surface to the east suggests a tendency of the craton margin to ascend. No coaxial stress resulting from either plate motion or from collapse of the Andean topography seems to control the directional shift of rivers in the basins. "

We have been able to isolate pure flat cells from early cultures of mixed retina cells and have identified several antigens which support the concept that these cells are related to the glia. The cells have been tested by immunofluorescence for glial fibrillary acidic protein and have been found positive. Cell surfaces were labeled by transfer of tritiated galactose from UDP-galactose to endogenous acceptors in the presence of exogenous galactosyl transferase. After SDS-PAGE and fluorography, the surface glycoproteins of flat cells were seen to be significantly different from those of the original retina, and from chick fibroblasts. Immunoelectron microscope studies of detergent-extracted flat cells have demonstrated a complex network of intermediate filaments and actin fibers. We conclude that the flat cells are derived from the glia subpopulation of the retina and have adapted to the tissue culture environment by assuming this configuration. The unique surface properties of flat cells may be related to their role as an intermediate substrate between the neuronal cells and the tissue culture dish. "

IgE levels were higher in HIV-infected subjects as a whole, compared to levels in seronegative control subjects (p&lt;0.05). This difference was particularly marked between patients with \{AIDS\} and control subjects (p&lt;0.005). A strong relationship appeared between IgE and the immune status as assessed by \{CD4\} cell counts (p&lt;0.001 between IgE values in patients with CD4&lt;300 or &gt;300/ÃŽÂ¼l). In addition, we assessed the predictive value of IgE elevation over disease progression: in subjects with a \{CD4\} count &lt;300/ÃŽÂ¼l, the survival analysis disclosed a 24-month occurrence rate of \{AIDS\} of 83% in individuals with IgE&gt;150 KIU/L versus 44% in individuals with IgE&lt;150 (p=0.016). In subjects with an AIDS-related complex, IgE&gt;150 indicated a 100% rate of \{AIDS\} versus 9% in individuals with IgE&lt;150 (p=0.003).

IgA, IgG, and IgM also significantly increased during \{HIV\} infection; the slope of their increase was, however, significantly less steep than that of IgE, suggesting different mechanisms of hyperproduction. Hypotheses regarding these mechanisms are discussed. "

To consider which of the various cognitive operations and other experiential phenomena involved in the \{WCST\} \{PET\} scan are critical for the pattern of physiological activation and to focus on the working memory component of the test, repeat \{WCST\} scans were also performed on nine of the subjects after instruction on the test and practice to criteria. We confirmed that performance of the \{WCST\} engages the frontal cortex and also produces activation of a complex network of regions consistently including the inferior parietal lobule but also involving the visual association and inferior temporal cortices as well as portions of the cerebellum. The \{WCST\} activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) remained significant even after training and practice on the test, suggesting that working memory may be largely responsible for the physiological response in \{DLPFC\} during the \{WCST\} and, conversely, that the \{DLPFC\} plays a major role in modulating working memory.

In most axons of acrylamide-treated chickens, a similar pattern was observed, except in axons which exhibited focal and intense labeling underneath the axolemma: clusters of silver grains indeed overlayed peripheral accumulations of tubulovesicular profiles of SER, dense core vesicles and mitochondria. After impregnation with heavy metals, electron microscope observation of 1 ÃŽÂ¼m thick sections showed a locally disorganized \{SER\} forming a complex network of tubules intermingled with vesicles and mitochondria. Such a local disorganization of the peripheral \{SER\} in the distal part of the axons, could be responsible for the focal stasis of fast transported proteins; it seems to be one of the earliest changes detectable in axons damaged by acrylamide treatment.

The addition of IGF-I to M cells leads to normal stimulation of \{DNA\} synthesis. However, inspite of the fact that mutant cells display normal \{TSH\} receptors, \{TSH\} is unable to stimulate the proliferation of the M cells. Nevertheless, \{TSH\} is able to increase intracellular levels of cAMP leading to regulation of \{TSH\} function in the M cells. On the other hand, \{TSH\} does not influence iodide transport and actin filaments depolimerization in these cells. However, aminoacid transport, stimulated in wild-type \{FRTL5\} cells by both \{TSH\} and IGFs, is under the control of \{IGFs\} but not of \{TSH\} in the mutant cells. Neither \{TSH\} or IGF-I modified the expression of C-fos proto-oncogene in the M cells, probably because of high constitutive expression. These data suggest that a crucial signalling step(s) required for \{TSH\} induced mitogenesis is impaired in the M cells, and that this signalling step is not required for IGF-I induced mitogenesis.

The final phase of the exercise involves the students in a completely open ended and realistic design problem, resulting from a proposed industrial development in the area of the supply network. The student is required to place himself or herself in the position of a manager of a water company who has to arrive at the cheapest viable solution from a wide range of options. This is very much the type of broad ranging design and management problem that occurs in practice. The package, which replaced a traditional laboratory experiment, has been running for two years now. The response of the students has been encouraging and many show sufficient interest to book additional computer time in order to develop and complete the design to their own satisfaction. As a teaching tool it has enabled us to identify those students who have the competence to synthesise rather than just analyse a problem, and this, in most areas of practising engineering, may be the more important ability.

Extrathymic hormonal influences include pituitary-derived hormones, such as prolactin and indirectly by \{ACTH\} via hydrocortisone from the adrenal, by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) via thyroid hormones from the thyroid, and by \{LH\} and \{RH\} via sex steroids from gonads and adrenal. In addition, the thymus produces several putatice thymic hormones: thymosin ÃŽÂ±1, thymulin and thymopoietin, which have been reported to circulate and to act on both prothymocytes and mature T-cells in the periphery thus maintaining their commitment to the T-cell system and its functions. These endocrine influences decline with age and are associated with Ã¢â‚¬Å“thymic menopauseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and cellular immune senescence contributing to the development of diseases in the aged. The intrathymic environment is characterized by a complex network of paracrine and autocrine endocrine signals involving both interleukins and thymic peptides. Thymic epithelial cells respond to IL-1 with proliferation and secretion of \{IL6\} and GM-CSF. they similarly respond to cellular interactions with the production of IL1. Thymic epithelial cells also secrete thymic hormones, as exemplified by the zinc-thymulin complex, under stimulation with \{IL1\} and other hormonal influences. Thymic stromal cells contribute, at minimum, IL1. These various interleukin and thymic hormone influences can be envisioned to operate in a synergistic interactive network to carry the evolving T-cell through its stepwise development to a mature T-cell. Further extra thymic influences regulatory for the secretory function of thymic epithelial cells and for the stepwise evolution of T-cells can be ascribed to circulating interleukins, mainly \{IL1\} and IL2, deriving from activation and secretion of leukocytes in the periphery which act in a synergistic fashion at all levels of T-cell development via induction of high affinity \{IL2\} receptors and the resultant \{IL2\} dependent proliferative responses. In the future, knowledge of the molecular basis of these endocrine interactions should provide immunopharmacologic insights into new molecules and strategies for promoting T-cell development and its restoration for the treatment of a variety of T-cell immunodeficiencies ranging from aging to cancer and \{HIV\} infection.

Somewhat more adequate approaches are those which recognize this complexity and attempt to identify the processes and how they function in a variety of tasks. This chapter places major emphasis on S controlled processes, which directly influence the adequacy of recall performance in certain tasks. The results from various research paradigms strongly implicate S-control processes in determining how well material is stored in memory, and its form. Accuracy in recall is directly related to characteristics of these processes. The pattern of free recall and its organization is determined by the pattern of Ss' rehearsals. The experiments also demonstrate that Ã¢â‚¬Å“rehearsalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ often involves coding or transformation of verbal items. In fact, elaborative coding strategies are almost universally used in verbal learning by the adults who form the S population for most experiments. It is suggested that the codes increase the accessibility of the verbal items at recall. "

Results from the laboratory that stress the basic analytical approach to a multienzyme regulatory complex are described. It is assumed that all vertebrate, membrane bound, hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclases are qualitatively similar in their regulation and composition. Observed differences among different cells merely reflect differences in the concentration of each protein or quantitative differences in their kinetic or equilibrium constants rather than qualitative differences in mechanism. As adenylate cyclase components prepared from different cells are shown to be capable of interacting with each other, this assumption is increasingly supported. "

abstract = {Blood cells develop in the bone marrow, controlled by a complex network of regulatory factors, some of which originate in the non-hemopoietic stroma. Previously we found that the predominant fibroblastoid (FB) cell growing in primary cultures of rat marrow bears surface antigens different from similar cells derived from certain other tissues. As determined by two monoclonal antibodies, the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmarrow typeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is ST3+/ST4Ã¢Ë†â€™, and the lsperipheral type' is ST3Ã¢Ë†â€™/ST4Ã¢Ë†â€™. Here we describe some of the functional differences between these two cell types. After primary cultures were depleted of hemopoietic elements and Ã¢â‚¬ËœotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ type FB, colony-stimulating activity was detected in the conditioned media (CM) of cells derived from marrow (ST3+), but not from lung (ST4+). Conversely, lung \{FB\} produced a \{CM\} that inhibited the clonogenic growth of normal marrow precursors. This substance (or substances) was produced by lung cells in the absence of exogenous stimulation, but by marrow cells only after they had been cultured in the presence of macrophage-derived products. The inhibitory activity did not have any measurable effect on murine blood cell precursors. We conclude that these isolated antibody-defined fibroblast subpopulations from different organs differ in their capacity to stimulate or inhibit normal hemopoietic precursors. "

abstract = {Nine \{SPOT\} \{XS\} scenes recorded during the dry season (January, February) and after cyclonic storms were analyzed to evaluate both the extent and consequences of floods in Bangladesh, in the deltaic complex of the Ganges. Digital and visual analysis showed the following results: 1) Near the capital, Dahka, within a \{SPOT\} scene (3600 km2), the extent of water varies from 324 km2 during the dry season to 1303 km2 after a destructive flood. This means that flood-prone areas in this overpopulated deltaic region are at least four times larger than the hydrographic network observed during the dry season. 2) The Sunderbans are the world's largest mangroves (about 6000 km2 in a single block); two-thirds of this forest (4050 km2) are in Bangladesh, and the rest is in India. These ecosystems seem to resist cyclones. No sign of any kind of mangrove alteration is seen on \{SPOT\} images recorded a few weeks after disastrous cyclonic storms (20 August 1987 and 6 September 1988). This is an important fact since the protective role of these coastal swamp forests is tremendously important. 3) The islands located in the very exposed area at the mouth of the Meghna are densely populated (more than 1000 inhabitants/km2). Hathya island has been carefully surveyed. According to the investigations carried out on \{SPOT\} images (25 February 1987 and 26 October 1988), the island seems to be at present satisfactorily protected against cyclones and tidal surges, behind newly planted mangroves (Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham.) and sheltered by a complex network of embankments which are visible on the images. It was concluded that the spectral separability of classes (water, natural plant communities, land use units) and the geometric accuracy of \{SPOT\} are suitable for coastal monitoring in this part of the Bangladesh.

The \{DNA\} spread into a protein monofilm exists of exceptionally long molecules or complex networks. The intramolecular heterogeneous \{DNA\} molecules have a high kinetic complexity. The plastome, which is present in a few copies only, contains a high genetic informational content. The pattern and the number of labeled polypeptides from protein synthesis in organulo argue against a greater coding capacity than found for other species. The plastome consists of several sequences of active genes with a genetic informational content similar to that found in other species. The plastome also contains silent nucleotide sequences of variable length, which are interspersed between the active sequences. These stretches could represent sequences of too low a \{GC\} content to code for any protein, sequences with lost genetic function, or sequences with stabilizing functions for the supramolecular topology in situ.

The asparagine side-chain has been replaced by that of the Thr and Ala residues and results in mutants with very similar properties.

The mutant Asn313 Ã¢â€ â€™ Thr still exhibits strict B-stereospecificity in hydride transfer and retains the property of negative co-operativity in \{NAD\} binding.

In the rat, the \{IC\} consists of dorsal and external cortices surrounding the central nucleus of \{IC\} (CNIC) which is populated by discoid and stellate neurons; the \{CNIC\} has a laminar appearance arising from organization of lemniscal fibers and processes of discoid cells. The \{IC\} of adult rats was chosen for implantation of whole grafts of E16Ã¢â‚¬â€œ17 caudal tectum into unilateral lesion sites. Dendritic and somal architecture of graft neurons was examined 1 to 4.5 months following implantation using rapid Golgi, \{HRP\} and Nissl methods. The \{CNIC\} of rat is dominated by principal neurons with relatively flattened dendritic fields. In grafts of caudal tectum the most common neuron class observed possesses flattened dendritic arbors which often parallel one another. These neurons also resemble \{CNIC\} neurons of host tissue adjacent to the graft border. Spine formations appear on both proximal and distal dendrites of this neural type in both normal and implanted tissues. In addition, comparable somal features of graft neurons include ovoid or fusiform shapes with regular nuclear membranes as found in the normal colliculus. In Golgi stained material fewer stellate class neurons appear as in the normal CNIC, although stellate cell classes are more abundant in the pericentral areas of normal tissue. Both neuron populations are retrogradely labelled in graft and normal \{IC\} after \{HRP\} injection into the medial geniculate body. These features suggest that the graft core typically consists of prototypic \{CNIC\} cells. Other features of neuron and glial cell density vary in graft material which also shows a complex network of vasculature. These results demonstrate that whole grafts of caudal tectum placed into the inferior colliculus can form organized neural architecture similar to the normal CNIC. The somal, dendritic and spine features of these neurons form a potential substrate for connectional and functional properties which establish this preparation as suitable for further investigation as a model for development and recovery of function in the central auditory system.

Antibody-induced suppression of \{C4\} was much longer lasting in cultured guinea pig splenic fragments than in cultured guinea pig peritoneal macrophages, suggesting that splenic fragments contained elements necessary for long-term suppression that were not present in the macrophage monolayers. This publication presents data in support of this concept. Antibodytreated splenic fragments from normal guinea pigsÃ¢â‚¬â€�but not from C4-deficient guinea pigsÃ¢â‚¬â€�elaborated a soluble factor (FsC4) that suppressed \{C4\} production in previously untreated splenic fragments. FsC4 activity was most potent in splenic fragment culture supernatants at those times when intracellular and secreted \{C4\} hemolytic activity and \{C4\} antigen were at their lowest. \{C4\} itself or a fragment of \{C4\} was therefore unlikely to mediate suppression in this system. Residual anti-C4 antibody was ruled out as a mediator of FsC4 activity since it was shown by two independent methods that the amount of anti-C4 antibody carried over with the supernatant was orders of magnitude less than the amount necessary to cause suppression or to neutralize fluid phase \{C4\} in fresh splenic fragment cultures. Preliminary data revealed that FsC4 activity may be mediated by two or more distinct molecular species or may be mediated by a single molecule that exhibits secondary size and charge heterogeneity. The identification of factors that are capable of regulating \{C4\} suggests that, as with immunoglobulins, complement components may be regulated by complex networks of immunocompetent cells and their soluble products.

From such studies, it is now apparent that the vascular endothelium represents an extraordinarily complex network of cells demonstrating a multitude of distinct anatomic, metabolic, and immunologic properties critical to such processes as angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, neoplasia, and a variety of metabolic disorders including homocystinuria and diabetes mellitus. This report will focus on the interactions of insulin and the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) with vascular endothelium, based on studies with cultured endothelial cells, isolated microvessels, and perfused organ systems. Data will be presented relevant to the following concepts: (1) endothelial cells, in culture and in vivo, have specific receptors for insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II; (2) insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II have both distinct and overlapping functions in cultured endothelial cells; (3) cultured endothelial cells process receptor-bound insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II, by distinct processes; (4) in vivo, capillary endothelial receptors are integrally involved in the transport of intact insulin to subendothelial sites of insulin action; and (5) vascular endothelium has specialized cellular features that are likely to contribute to the unique interactions of endothelial cells with insulin and the IGFs.

At the cellular level, this regulatory microenviroment can be divided, in a simplified fashion, into two major compartments: the humoral compartment, including compounds such as hormones, growth factors and nutrients, and the contact-environment compartment, including cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. At least in cultures of diploid, non-transformed cells, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions have been shown to be of major importance for the regulation of growth as well as of differentiation. Although until now the glycoprotein involved in the contact-dependent inhibition of growth has not been fully characterized, our studies give evidence for the involvement of a plasma membrane glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of Ã¢Ë†Â¼80 kDa in the growth regulation of diploid human fibroblast. The important characteristics of this glycoprotein is: the biologically active determinant resides in terminal, ÃŽÂ²-glycosidically linked galactose residues on N-glycosidically linked glycans. From our studies, a receptor has to be postulated which, in addition to the galactose residues, has additional structural requirements for the specific binding of this glycoprotein, sicne other glycoproteins carrying terminal, ÃŽÂ²-glycosidically linked galactose-residues are without biological activity. The postulated receptor is suggested to be defective in tumor cells, since these cells are no longer able to respond to cell-cell contacts with stopped proliferation, although they are able to inhibit growth of non-transformed cells. The inability of a tumor cell to recognize and to bind to the specific glycoprotein would result in a release from growth inhibition, leading to clonal growth of these cells. Further detailed studies on the structure and the regulation of the glycoprotein, as well as an attempt to isolate the postulated receptor, should lead to a better understanding of the complex pattern of growth regulation of normal cells.

After homing in the tissues they give rise to mature MCs. Recruitment and differentiation as well as terminal maturation of \{MCs\} is regulated by a complex network of factors. Two major arms of control have been delineated based on in vitro studies and experimental animal models. The first involves the response of the progenitor cells to growth inducing cytokines, such as IL-3. This type of control promotes the generation of \{MC\} precursor cells. The second arm of control involves the microenvironmental network interacting with the \{MC\} progenitors. It consists of both stroma cell- and immune cell-derived differentiation factors and the direct interaction of cells. It may be important for homing of \{MC\} progenitors during embryogenesis and probably throughout life. The stromal component also determines terminal differentiation towards a particular type of \{MCs\} and also supports in vitro development of \{MCs\} in long term cultures. Growth and function of the mature \{MCs\} in the various tissues may be triggered by additional factors including the interactions of \{MCs\} with other leukocytes and nerver cells. The coupling of \{MC\} activation processes with subsequent proliferation may be a triggering factor in allergic disease. This article attempts to provide a synthesis of current knowledge on \{MC\} development. Wherever possible, species differences and the fundamental differences between \{MCs\} and basophils are discussed. "

The assembly, function, and stability of the ribosome are all assured by a complex network of specific associations among its protein and \{RNA\} constituents. Over one-third of the 50 to 55 ribosomal proteins from Escherichia coli have been shown to bind directly and independently to homologous 16 S, 23 S, and 5 S RNAs. These interactions play a major role in the early phases of 30 S and 50 S subunit assembly by initiating the formation of a series of protein nuclei within localized, and relatively antonomous, segments of the RNA. The importance of direct protein-RNA interaction in ribosome reconstitution was clearly delineated by the derivation of an assembly map for the E. coli 30 S subunit which showed that the binding of a small group of proteins to the 16 S \{RNA\} was a prerequisite for subsequent assembly reactions. The chapter provides an overview of techniques currently used in the study of interactions among protein and \{RNA\} constituents of bacterial ribosomes. Procedures for the formation, identification, and enzymic fragmentation of ribonucleoprotein complexes are also described. The application of several specialized techniques, both conventional and novel, to ribosomal proteinÃ¢â‚¬â€�RNA association are surveyed, with particular attention to the kinds of information they provide.

The tight junctional particles are aligned in ridges shared by fusion of the plasma membranes of adjacent cells, thereby leading to closure of the intercellular space. Tight junctions or zonulae occludentes provide a seal among the epithelial cells, thereby creating a diffusion barrier to the intercellular movement of ions and molecules. The en face views of membranes are revealed, and then the intramembranous patterns assumed by junctional particles may be studied using the freeze-cleaved replicas. The plasma membrane of vertebrate cells is divided by circumferential junctions that establish and maintain cellular polarity. Tight tight junctions have a complex reticulum of tight junctional ridges, while leaky tight junctions have fewer strands and a less complex network. In the arthropods, which exhibit many physiological differences from vertebrate species, there has been a search for tight junctions in tissues known to possess permeability barriers. Analysis of the development of tight junctions can occur in vivo only during embryonic and very early hatchling stages in arthropods or possibly during the regeneration of injured tissues. The chapter also summarizes the features that various junctions share with tight junctions, together with the respects in which they differ. "

Young rats and tumor-bearing rats have previously been shown to produce poor proliferative responses to PHA, Con A and syngeneic methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced fibrosarcoma cells. The poor responses to \{PHA\} and Con A are mediated by \{PGE2\} in unfractioned (UNF) and nylon wool adherent (ADH) cells. The same relationship was also established in the mixed leukocyte-tumor cell (MLTC) response to \{MCA\} tumor cells although it appears to be of only minor significance as the enhancement following indomethacin (IND) treatment is still relatively poor response. Indomethacin generally had no effect on the proliferative responses of tumor-bearing animals indicating that the suppression was not mediated through the cyclooxygenase pathway. We have also extended a previous observation in which \{UNF\} cells were found to be unresponsive to alloantigen stimulation. This suppression does not appear to be mediated through cyclooxygenase products as \{IND\} treatment does not enhance the \{UNF\} response although it does enhance the \{ADH\} response. These data indicate that a complex network of cyclooxygenase dependent and independent regulation exists in normal and tumor-bearing \{NBR\} rats. "

Finally, the cytokines, interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor, released from macrophages have both direct stimulatory effects on oxygen radical formation in neutrophils and can Ã¢â‚¬Å“primeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ macrophages for enhanced oxygen radical responses to other agonists. Cytokines may also alter endothelial cells rendering them more susceptible to oxygen radical mediated injury by neutrophils. This suggests a complex network of interactions between phagocytic cells and peptide mediators, the result of which is acute, oxygen radical mediated tissue injury. "

The mutants Arg45-eglin c and Lys53-eglin c were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis in order to investigate the inhibitory specificity and stability of eglin c. Arg45-eglin became a potent trypsin inhibitor, in contrast to native eglin, which is an elastase inhibitor. This specificity change was rationalized by comparing the structures of Arg45-eglin and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and their interactions with trypsin. The residue Arg53, which participates in a complex network of hydrogen bonds formed between the core and the binding loop of eglin c, was replaced with the shorter basic amino acid lysine in the mutant Lys53-eglin. Two hydrogen bonds with Thr44, located in the binding loop, can no longer be formed but are partially restored by a water molecule bound in the vicinity of Lys53. Eglin c in complexes with both subtilisin Novo and subtilisin Carlsberg was crystallized in two different space groups. Comparison of the complexes showed a rigid body rotation for the eglin c core of 11.5 Ã‚Â° with respect to the enzyme, probably caused by different intermolecular contacts in both crystal forms. "

In both species, cryostat sections of the organ of Corti were studied using confocal fluorescence microscopy; in the bat, ultrathin sections were investigated using actin-immunoelectron and classical electron microscopy. F-actin was found in stereocilia and cuticular plates of inner and outer hair cells (IHCs and OHCs) of both species. In fixed material from both species, no F-actin staining was detected in the cytoplasm or along the lateral cell membrane of OHCs, whereas in freshly isolated \{OHCs\} of the gerbil, a faint F-actin staining was detected along the lateral wall. In the bat, the patterns of F-actin staining were confirmed with actin-immunoelectron microscopy. The ÃŽÂ±-tubulin antibody strongly labeled \{IHCs\} of both species. They contained a complex network of microtubules especially in the neck portion. In the bat, \{OHCs\} showed no distinct ÃŽÂ±-tubulin reactivity, as would be expected given the scarcity of microtubules observed at the ultrastructural level. In the gerbil, ÃŽÂ±-tubulin reactivity was found throughout the \{OHC\} body with highest intensity in the cell apex. In Deiters cells, pillar cells and Boettcher cells of both species, F-actin and microtubules were colocalized at contact zones with the basilar membrane. In Deiters cups, F-actin staining was most pronounced in the basal turn of the bat cochlea. In the gerbil, a distinct baso-apical gradient was found in immunostaining properties and morphology of the Deiters cells. Intense fodrin reactivity was found in the cuticular plates and along the lateral cell membrane of both types of hair cells of the bat. Cytoplasmic fodrin staining was localized within the \{IHCs\} of the bat. In the gerbil, intense fodrin staining was only found in cuticular plates of hair cells and staining of the lateral cell membrane of hair cells was faint. A faint fodrin staining was also seen in Deiters cells of both species. The basic arrangement of the cytoskeletal elements in the batÃ…â€º organ of Corti is similar to that of other mammals, however, certain features suggest the presence of subtle differences in micromechanical properties: there is an increased concentration of microtubules in the neck portion of IHCs, an increase in the amount of F-actin within the Deiters cups and a reduced amount of microtubules in the OHCs.

abstract = {Thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are common complications of infections. Abnormal activation of coagulation is due in part to expression of tissue factor on intravascular cells in response to cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta (IL1ÃŽÂ²) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both \{TNF\} and IL1ÃŽÂ² are thought to play significant roles in producing the pathologic manifestations of sepsis. Therefore, we examined the effects of thrombin on \{TNF\} and IL1ÃŽÂ² secretion by monocytes, and the ability of monocyte products to promote tissue factor expression by endothelial cells. Human monocytes were treated with thrombin or a thrombin receptor agonist peptide (SFLLRN), and/or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The agonists were removed, and monocytes cultured 18 hours. The monocyte-conditioned supernatants were assayed for \{TNF\} and IL1ÃŽÂ² antigen, and for their ability to induce tissue factor expression on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the Ea.hy endothelial cell line. Thrombin alone did not promote monocyte \{TNF\} or IL-1ÃŽÂ² secretion. However, thrombin enhanced LPS-induced \{TNF\} and \{IL1\} secretion. Supernatants from monocytes exposed to \{LPS\} plus thrombin promoted greater tissue factor expression on endothelial cells than supernatants from those treated with \{LPS\} only. \{SFLLRN\} did not increase \{TNF\} secretion in response to LPS, but did enhance LPS-induced IL1ÃŽÂ² secretion and tissue factor-inducing activity. Neither \{SFLLRN\} nor active thrombin augmented the level of mRNA for \{TNF\} above that induced by \{LPS\} alone. However, both increased the LPS-induced level of IL1ÃŽÂ² message. Thus, thrombin enhanced LPS-induced \{TNF\} and IL1ÃŽÂ² secretion by monocytes. Unexpectedly, the effects on these two cytokines were mediated by different mechanisms. Enhancement of LPs-induced IL1ÃŽÂ² secretion was largely mediated via the tethered ligand type thrombin receptor and correlated with an increase in the steady state level of mRNA. By contrast, enhanced \{TNF\} required proteolytically active thrombin, but was not mediated by the tethered ligand receptor. These data demonstrate that physiologically relevant amounts of thrombin can synergize with endotoxin to stimulate monokine release. Thrombin could thereby play a role in the complex network of mediators involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis. We speculate that limiting thrombin activity during \{DIC\} could be a beneficial adjunct in the management of sepsis. "

The hydrated \{EJ\} coat forms an extensive fibrous network that makes contact with the vitelline layer at the egg surface. Fibers are decorated along their length with particles, particle density being highest in the interior regions of the coat. The macromolecular components making up the \{EJ\} network were visualized by rotary-shadowing of mica-adsorbed \{EJ\} samples. Whole \{EJ\} coats solubilized in pH 5 seawater and spread on the mica surface consist of complex networks of branching fibers decorated with large patches of amorphous material. As we have previously shown (Keller and Vacquier, 1994), \{EJ\} boiled in a dissolution buffer containing \{SDS\} and ÃŽÂ²-mercaptoethanol and applied to a Sephacryl-500 gel filtration column can be separated into three fractions: a 380-kDa fucose sulfate polymer (FSP), which elutes in the void volume, and two column-included fractions consisting of intermediate (300 kDa) and low-molecular-weight (30- to 138-kDa) glycoproteins. Rotary-shadowing of the \{FSP\} fraction reveals branched fibrous components similar in appearance to that of solubilized whole \{EJ\} but devoid of any particulate decoration. In contrast, intermediate- and low-molecular-weight \{EJ\} components are strictly globular in appearance but are distinguishable on the basis of size. Ion-exchange purification of whole \{EJ\} yields two glycoproteins, of 82 and 138 kDa, having AR-inducing activity (Keller and Vacquier, 1994). Platinum replication shows these active components to be small spherical molecules about 8 nm in diameter. The above fractionation scheme requires harsh dissociation conditions. Indeed, if \{EJ\} is not boiled in \{SDS\} buffer before fractionation, the 300-kDa fraction and the \{FSP\} appear together in the void volume. Rotary-shadowing of this complex reveals a multistranded polymer, decorated with glycoproteins at specific kink points. Taken together, our data suggest that the \{EJ\} network is composed of a fucose sulfate polymer superstructure to which glycoproteins are bound. "

The fluorescent lipid analog DiIC16[3] was used to label either the external membranes (plasmalemma and transverse (T)-tubules) or the internal \{SR\} in living and fixed muscle. Short membrane invaginations can first be seen in fibers at E14, and at \{E15\} longitudinal T-tubules appear in the periphery of the fibers. A complex network of T-tubules filling the whole fiber diameter develops suddenly at E16. In contrast, \{SR\} is abundant at the earliest observed stage (E12) and forms regularly spaced cross striations located at the I-Z-I bands. These correspond to a specific accumulation of smooth membranes around the Z-discs seen in electron micrographs. While \{SR\} is specifically associated with the newly formed myofibrils in the periphery of the fibers, the disposition of early T-tubules shows little specific relationship to either \{SR\} or the myofibrils. However, electron microscopy shows that junctions between T-tubules and \{SR\} are formed during this period (Takekura and Franzini-Armstrong, submitted for publication). Junctions do not acquire a specific relation to the myofibrils until around hatching when triads begin to reorganize into their mature location, the A-I junction. These findings indicate three key events in the organization of T-tubules and \{SR\} in the sarcomeres: (1) early SR/Z-line interactions independent of T-tubules; (2) SR/T-tubule interactions to form the triad junctions, independent from the myofibrils; and (3) the late association of the junctional complexes with the myofibrils at the A-I border.

The extruded \{TPS\} materials were stored at 60% relative humidity for 12 months to level out differences in starch structure due to retrogradation. The water content was then varied by an additional storage period at various humidities. The average molecular masses of the \{TPS\} materials, composed of native starch or of hydrolysed starch, were 37 000 and 1900 kg molÃ¢Ë†â€™1, respectively. The apparent amylose contents of the high and low molecular mass materials were 25% and 11%, respectively. Differences were observed in thermal properties and crystallinity between the two types of materials, as a function of water content but not as a function of molecular mass. The stress-strain properties of the materials were dependent on the water content. The materials showed a viscoelastic behaviour characteristic of a semicrystalline polymer. Materials containing less than 9% water were glassy with an elastic modulus between 400 and 1000 MPa. For the materials a transition from brittle to ductile behaviour occurred at a water content in the range of 9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10%, which is in accordance with the observed glass transition temperature at this water content. The rubbery materials, with a water content of 9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ15%, were tough and an optimum in ultimate elongation was observed. Above a water content of 15% the materials became weak and soft and the strain at break decreased. No significant differences in brittle-to-ductile transition as a function of water content were observed between the low and high molecular mass \{TPS\} materials. In the rubbery state with 14% water, the elongations at break of the high and low molecular mass materials were 100Ã¢â‚¬â€œ125% and 30Ã¢â‚¬â€œ50%, respectively. The tearing energy of the materials showed a maximum at a water content of 9Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10%. The energies at this maximum of the high and low molecular mass materials were 0.15 and 0.1 J mmÃ¢Ë†â€™2, respectively. The lower strain and tearing energy of the low molecular mass materials in the rubbery state were attributed to the reduced amylose chain length as well as the molecular mass and the degree of branching of the amylopectin molecules. This resulted in a material with a less effective entangled starch matrix. The entanglements were described as a complex network of the linear amylose chains and the outer chains of the amylopectin molecules in which hydrogen bonding plays an important role. "

The size of this palaeo-valley ranges from 0.5 km wide and 15Ã¢â‚¬â€œ100 m deep at its western end, to 1.6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.8 km wide and 200Ã¢â‚¬â€œ250 m deep downstream. An important tributary system is observed, with a main canyon (6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ8 km wide and 150Ã¢â‚¬â€œ200 m deep) draining the Ebro margin, as well as many other smaller valleys draining the Catalan and Balearic margins. Downstream, other tributaries underlie the present canyons of the Catalan margin. The location of the tributary system is controlled by the Early Miocene rift structures. The relief of the Messinian surface is affected by post-Miocene deformation that results from salt diapirism, extensional faulting and related volcanism. Late Neogene to Quaternary volcanic edifices cut the Messinian surface and coincide with large residual magnetic anomalies. Lower Pliocene to Quaternary salt diapirism in the abyssal plain north of Menorca has created a series of structural highs. Between these highs are deep interdiapiric troughs or basins that have become sediment depocentres during the Plio-Quaternary. The complex network of erosional valleys from the Valencia trough continental margin demonstrates that the valley system in the basin was not related to the refilling of the Mediterranean, but to the Iberian and Balearic margin palaeodrainage that developed during the Messinian desiccation. The presence of at least three erosional unconformities suggests that there were alternating periods of flooding and retreat of Atlantic water during Messinian time. The Messinian subaerial margin with erosional valleys contrasts sharply with the Pliocene-Quaternary marine margin with progradational turbidite systems. "

Reducing exposure time to NiCl2 to 30s did not result in backfilling of intact preparations. However, if the nervi corporis allati I (NCA 1) were sectioned, then exposed to NiCl2 for 30s and incubated in culture medium at 4Ã‚Â°C for 24 h, neurones of the severed \{NCA\} I backfilled to somata originating in the pars intercerebralis and pars lateralis. In addition, the axons distal to the cut also filled with the tracer in the orthograde direction, revealing a complex network of axon terminals investing the corpora allata. Sectioned nervi corporis allati I exposed to the tracer solution, then incubated in culture medium for 0.5 h, rapidly backfilled at a rate of 30Ã¢â‚¬â€œ100 mm/day. Rapid backfilling did not occur in the absence of BSA. One per cent fluorescein isothiocyanide-labelled \{BSA\} backfilled as rapidly as the NiCl2BSA solution. 2,4-Dinitrophenol and cytochalasin B inhibited brief-exposure backfilling whereas colchicine had no effect in short term incubations but partially inhibited backfilling in long term incubations. Backfilling is thus a metabolically mediated event and the rate of transport of the tracer is similar to that of retrograde fast axonal transport of proteins. "

In this article, it is shown that their methods can also be used to obtain the probability that a particular path in the \{PERT\} network is critical [6]. One possible criticism of their approach is that computation of both the probability that a particular path is critical and the summary characteristics of the reaction time distribution require the translation of a \{PERT\} network into an \{OP\} (Order-of-ftocessing) diagram. Currently, this translation can only be done manually, a very laborious process for even moderately complex networks. In this article, an algorithm is developed which can be used to generate the \{OP\} diagram for a given \{PERT\} network. The algorithm has been implemented in FORTRAN. Once the \{OP\} diagram is constructed, computation of both the probability that a particular path is critical and the expectation, variance and distribution of the project completion time requires only simple matrix operations when the durations of the tasks in the network are mutually independent probability mixtures of general-gamma random variables. More complex calculations are required when other distributions of the task durations are involved. "

Histological sections of biopsy material having been embedded in paraffin were projected on cardboard. After the projections had been cut out, the single parts were arranged in a way to form a three-dimensional model. Radicular cysts are monolocular and exhibit a smooth surface. The individual cyst is surrounded unilaterally by epithelial cell remnants of Malassez opposite to the adhering tooth. The bone shows a reactive-inflammatory transformation. Keratocysts occur in connection with the Gorlin-Goltz-syndrome and reveal a primary multiple structure. Smaller cysts have a round and smooth appearance, whereas the larger ones show an irregular surface. Satellite cysts of various sizes which develop in the adjacent areas are connected with the primary cyst. We are therefore dealing with two different types of cysts: with monolocular cysts which show a complex network and are connected with satellite cysts on the one hand, and, on the other, with additional multiple cyst systems including monolocular and multilocular cysts of various sizes. The surrounding bone shows the characteristics of compression atrophy rather than signs of an inflammation. "

abstract = {Publisher Summary No direct information is available at present about synaptic activities or nerve impulse discharges in the central nervous system of bird embryos. Spontaneous and evoked electrical potentials are known to reflect in many instances the summated synaptic potentials in complex networks. The potential that is evoked directly at the surface of the cerebral hemisphere by a brief shock is first seen in the chick embryo several days before any spontaneous electrical potential can be recorded. Until about the 17th day of incubation, it consists simply of a short duration, surface negative wave, which is moreover clearly discernible in all later stages. Its short duration and its stability during repetitive stimulation indicate that some type of unitary potential is responsible. In considering molecular parameters during maturation, two factors are of prime interest with respect to neuronal function, viz. ionic pumps that maintain concentration gradients across the cell membranes and energy requirements for these processes. The membrane properties of probably every type of cell in most animals depend upon the reaction of a single molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A sodium-potassium activated ATP-ase, detected in peripheral nerves, appears to constitute the enzymatic basis for active transport across cell membranes. "

Body, mind, thought, and deed are inextricably entangled in a complex network of interconnections which, due to our human limitations, can never be fully understood (Capra, 1988; Chopra, 1989; Frankl, 1969; Gut, 1989; Hughes, 1974). In the development of psychology, much energy has been spent seeking scientifically acceptable concepts, laws, and measurements which subscribe to the Cartesian image of the human being as a clockwork mechanism (Capra, 1988; von Bertalanffy, 1968). To accommodate this mechanistic image, psychological theorists have largely borrowed and adapted concepts from physics, physiology, and mathematics, with little consensus reached about the validity of their actions. The tendency to emulate Ã¢â‚¬Å“hardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ science has contributed to the failure of psychological theory and practice to relate comprehensively to the broad issues and problems of human existence (Jordaan &amp; Jordaan, 1984; White, 1993a). The process-based systems view, which has its origins in Heraclitus of Ephesus (Kahn, 1981; Kirk, Raven &amp; Schofield, 1983; Wheelwright, 1959), is a radical reversal of the mechanistic view and represents the human being as an Ã¢â‚¬Å“active personality system,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which individual uniqueness and creative potential are valued. The systems view of humanity raises issues largely ignored by a scientific psychological viewÃ¢â‚¬â€�such as aspects of creativity, self awareness, unpredictability, multivariable interaction, dynamic organization, self-maintenance, directiveness, etc. Process-based systems thinking does not disregard structural aspects of systems but regards them as the conceptual or material coherence of processes. It is a perspective in which process is Ã¢â‚¬Å“foregroundedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ relative to structure. The relationship of process to structure suggests a union of opposites (Sabelli, 1991a,b) in which both empirical and interpretive outlooks are compatible (Messer, 1990), reflecting a healthy regard for methodological and theoretical diversity. Process-based systems thinking promotes a shift from structure-based rigidity to a position which presents new challenges and invites a fresh look at old issues in this postmodern (Gergen, 1992; Kvale, 1992) era of psychology. The premises of process-based systems thinking singled out for discussion in this article are: the process nature of life (and psychology), the approximate nature of systems, dynamic organization, the union of opposites, teleos, governance, and emergence in systems.

A detailed illustration of the nerve pathways within the system is presented. The stomatogastric nervous system comprises a frontal ganglion, hypocerebral ganglion, and paired ingluvial ganglia. Nerve pathways link this system to the brain, retrocerebral glands and to the musculature of the foregut and head. Two fine nerves leave each frontal connective, \{FCN\} 1 and \{FCN\} 2. The former divides into an inner nerve, which joins with its counterpart from the opposite side, and an outer nerve which joins with a fine branch of the median nerve and supplies the dilator muscles of the cibarium and the posterior retractor muscles of the labrum. \{FCN\} 2 innervates the dorsal dilator muscles of the pharynx and the retractor muscles of the labrum. The median nerve leaves the anterior margin of the frontal ganglion and innervates the clypeus, epipharynx, and the anterior retractor muscles of the labrum. A single pair of pharyngeal nerves leaves the frontal ganglion and these ramify over the surface of the gut, forming a complex network. Numerous fine nerves were observed linking the recurrent nerve and the dorsal musculature of the pharynx. Three cell types were observed in the pars intercerebralis medialis of the brain, of which one was recognised as being neurosecretory. Neurosecretory Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ material, present in these cells, was also found in the \{NCC\} 1 and the anterior storage lobe of the corpora cardiaca.

(Lepidoptera : Lymantriidae), as they moved through the vasa deferentia in relation to the photoperiod. Two expanded regions (upper vas deferens and seminal vesicle, respectively) occur sequentially along each vas deferens. Each has a characteristic type of epithelial cell, and another distinct type of cell occurs in the constricted region between the 2 expanded regions. Each cell type has characteristic secretory products. The cells lining the upper vas deferens, in particular, exhibit well-defined daily periodicities in activity and in types of secretory products. In a photoperiod, consisting of 16 hr light and 8 hr of dark, sperm release from the testes is initiated about 4 hr before darkness. After about 14 hr, the sperm mass and associated secretory material move rapidly to the seminal vesicles. As apyrene sperm bundles move through the cellular membranes at the base of the testis into an upper vas deferens, most of the enclosing cyst cells lyse, and an external sheath is formed over the plasma membrane of the sperm. No further morphological changes are seen in the individual sperm cells. However, the apyrene sperm remain in bundles for a time, owing, at least partly, to the delayed lysis of the apical cyst cell in which the sperm are embedded. Large numbers of annulate rods also bind to the sperm during this early period and may play a role in keeping the sperm in bundles. All cyst cells of eupyrene sperm bundles lyse during passage out of the testes. However, the sperm remain in bundles with a uniform spacing between individual cells. This may be due initially to some type of bonding between surface consituents of the sperm, but a matrix of fibrous strands is laid down around the sperm replacing the cyst cells present earlier. The first signs of the matrix are annulate rods that attach to the sperm in the head region and form a network. Other annulate bodies are found in the tail region of the sperm. Eventually, a complex network of strands is formed around the sperm. The annulate bodies seen around the sperm shortly after they leave the testes, are apparently derived from cell coat material initially laid down around the microvilli of the epithelial cells. The sources of the components of the completed matrix remain in doubt. When the sperm mass moves to the seminal vesicles, fine filaments coalesce around the apyrene sperm, while a membrane forms around the eupyrene bundles. "

Whole mount preparations of septum-sinus venosus or atria and sections of ventricular muscle were prepared for immunocytochemistry. Galanin-immunoreactive fibers were found coursing diffusely across the septum-sinus venosus to form complex networks over cardiac muscle strands. Individual atrial muscle strands were densely innervated by galanin-immunoreactive fibers and galaninimmunoreactive fibers were also observed in the epicardial and myocardial layers of the ventricle. Most of the parasympathetic postganglionic neurons in the cardiac ganglion and many of the small intensely fluorescent-like cells exhibited galanin immunoreactivity. Galanin-immunoreactive fibers were present in the nerve trunks connecting clusters of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. Close associations between galanin-positive fibers and individual parasympathetic postganglionic neurons were also observed. The presence of the galanin-immunoreactive fibers was similar in preparations taken from animals pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine to that seen in preparations taken from control animals, indicating that the galanin-positive fibers were not sympathetic postganglionic axons. Moreover, the galaninimmunoreactive nerve fibers were separate from fibers containing substance P and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide that have previously been shown to be processes of afferent fibers. In twitch-tension experiments, galanin in the range1 Ãƒâ€” 10Ã¢Ë†â€™7 to1 Ãƒâ€” 10Ã¢Ë†â€™6M caused cardioinhibition of spontaneously beating isolated septal-sinus venosus preparations. Galanin also produced a concentrationdependent1 Ãƒâ€” 10Ã¢Ë†â€™7 to1 Ãƒâ€” 10Ã¢Ë†â€™6M decrease in the twitch-tension development of electrically stimulated atrial or ventricular preparations. Local application of galanin produced hyperpolarization of cardiac muscle fibers in both isolated septal-sinus venosus preparations and atrial preparations. The response of individual parasympathetic ganglion cells to local application of galanin varied between neurons; some neurons were depolarized whereas others were hyperpolarized. We conclude that a galanin-like peptide is contained in both the parasympathetic postganglionic neurons and small intensely fluorescent-like cells and their processes. Further, we hypothesize that in the case of the parasympathetic postganglionic neurons, the galanin-like peptide may work in conjunction with acetylcholine to regulate cardiac activity. "

Previous studies have documented the presence of anatomoses between capillaries originating from a common artery; however, the existence of anastomotic vessels connecting different arteries remains a subject of controversy. The objective of the current study was to determine the extent of anastomotic connections between the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (Cx) beds at the capillary level in the canine heart. Red phthalo pigment (Dupont: Wilmington, Del.) was perfused in vitro, at 120 mm Hg, into the \{LAD\} bed, while blue pigment was perfused simultaneously, under the same pressure, into the Cx. Capillary anastomoses between the \{LAD\} and Cx were confirmed histologically by the consistent presence of vessels at the junction of the two perfusion fields filled with both colors of pigment. In normal dog hearts, 21.9 Ã‚Â± 2.8% (mean Ã‚Â± SEM) of vessels at the junction of the \{LAD\} and Cx were perfused by both arterial trees; the percentage capillary anastomoses did not vary significantly with location, apex to base, in the hearts. In addition, the proportion of capillary anastomoses was not altered by either 1 or 6 hr of coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion (21.3 Ã‚Â± 2.8% and 22.5 Ã‚Â± 2.6%, respectively), or by postmortem cautery of the epicardial collateral vessels (21.8 Ã‚Â± 5.1%). To assess the potential functional role of these capillary interconnections, regional blood flow at the outer margin of the \{LAD\} bed, measured during \{LAD\} occlusion by injection of radioactive microspheres, was considered as a function of percentage capillary anastomoses. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.87) between the proportion of anastomoses between the two circulations and blood flow at the outermost edge of the \{LAD\} bed, while the \{LAD\} was occluded. These results suggest that the anastomoses between the \{LAD\} and Cx beds in canine hearts could be important in maintaining blood flow at the extreme outer edge of the perfusion field, if flow through one of the arteries is impaired.

We call it HyperCOSTOC because it is based on a database of lessons called \{COSTOC\} and has facilities which have a hypermedia flavor (i.e. navigation, browsing, cross-window communication, and others). However, unlike hypertext and other electronic information systems (e.g. database management systems), HyperCOSTOC is an advanced \{CAI\} system which can retrieve and process, in a non-linear fashion, structured molecules of instructional or information material networked together. HyperCOSTOC uses a mixture of presentation-type-CAI, object-oriented programming and query language techniques for university teaching and research. It provides a user interface which includes selection mechanisms, feedback mechanisms and input-output devices. HyperCOSTOC aims at a practical and viable approach within a university setting. It comprises tools for the creation, distribution, and usage of a variety of courseware or information in a fashion which is modular, technology independent, easy to maintain, and which includes drill, self-test, exam and other modules. Hypertext largely depends on the power of the computer to traverse complex networks of information and to support advanced word processing while freely linking ideas on-line. HyperCOSTOC is supposed to be as hardware-independent as possible and geared towards easy integration with a variety of instructional environments: as a support system to traditional lecturestyle instruction as well as for the development of exploratory research environments. The \{COSTOC\} system (a simple minded precursor of HyperCOSTOC) is currently being used in about 20 educational institutions. \{COSTOC\} includes a database of hundreds of one-hour lessons, with over 250 on computer science topics. Starting from this courseware basis, HyperCOSTOC is supposed to add many new facilities, including better navigation, browsing, window cross-talk as well as aspects of student modeling. It should be emphasized, however, that the first implementation of HyperCOSTOC will put little emphasis on intelligent-CAI (ICAI) techniques (e.g. intelligent tutoring, intelligent student modeling) because we believe that further developments are necessary before \{ICAI\} will become as broadly applicable as other aspects of CAI.

This tissue consists of four main layers: an inner non-cellular layer (basement membrane), an inner cellular layer, an outer non-cellular layer and an outer cellular layer. The inner non-cellular layer contains a complex network of fibres which we have identified as reticular fibres. By electron microscopy it has been shown that the fibres are embedded in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“clearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ region sandwiched between two Ã¢â‚¬Å“denseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ layers. Morphologically, there is some similarity between cells of the inner cellular layer and smooth muscle cells of uterus and bladder as described by other workers. Both lots of cells contain many fine filaments which tend to limit the disposition of other cytoplasmic elements. The view that cells of the inner cellular layer may be a type of smooth muscle cell of a different level of organisation from those of uterus and bladder is discussed. The outer non-cellular layer contains a much less developed network of reticular fibres than the inner non-cellular layer. The fibres are considerably fewer and are embedded in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“clearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ region usually associated with only a single layer of dense material. The outer cellular layer is extremely thin and is composed of elongate cells which do not possess fine filaments. These cells are probably fibroblasts. No difference in staining reaction was discovered between normal tissue and that which had been heavily irradiated. Even after the very high dose of radiation employed the ultrastructure of the cells of the boundary tissue remained apparently intact. Noticeable changes occurred in the non-cellular regions, however, and are described in detail. The possible physiological significance of the morphological results obtained is discussed. "

The tracer was injected in similar quantities in the putamen on the left side and in the caudate nucleus on the right side in 10 monkeys, and its presence was revealed by means of the tetramethylbenzidine method. The study of anterogradely labeled fibers visualized after such injections shows that putaminofugal fibers terminate massively in the ventral two-thirds of the globus pallidus, where they display a band-like arrangement, and much less abundantly in the caudal third of the substantia nigra. In contrast, caudatofugal fibers occupy only the dorsal third of globus pallidus but arborize profusely in the rostral two-thirds of substantia nigra. In the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra the caudatonigral fibers form a highly complex network composed of fiber trabeculae while the putaminonigral fibers occur as more discrete fascicles confined to the dorsolateral region of the structure. In the pars compacta of the substantia nigra the retrogradely labeled cells occur in the form of clusters that are closely intermingled with clusters of unlabeled neurons. The labeled-cell clusters are particularly dense on the putamen-injected side and more loosely organized on the caudate-injected side. On both sides, however, the striatonigral fibers that reach the substantia nigra pars compacta can be seen to terminate almost exclusively upon clusters composed of retrogradely labeled cells, suggesting the existence of a precise reciprocal link between nigral and striatal neuronal aggregates. At thalamic levels the retrogradely labeled cells are distributed according to a strikingly asymmetric pattern. For instance, a prominent labeling of neurons in the central superior lateral nucleus is seen only on the caudate-injected side. Furthermore, in the centromedian/parafascicular complex retrograde cell labeling is seen exclusively in parafascicular nucleus on the caudate-injected side and only in the centromedian nucleus, except its lateralmost portion, on the putamen-injected side. Control experiments involving injection of the tracer in cerebral cortex overlying the striatum reveal that the neurons in the lateral segment of the centromedian, which do not project to striatum, are in fact reciprocally connected with the cerebral cortex. In addition, our data show that some of the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“specificÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ thalamic nuclei contribute significantly to the thalamostriatal projection in monkey. A particularly prominent projection arises in the ventral anteriorventral lateral nuclei where neurons projecting either to putamen or caudate nucleus occupy different territories. Finally, a significant number of striatal afferent neurons also occurs in midbrain raphe nuclei, pedunculopontine nucleus and amygdala. These various findings indicate that the subcortical connections of caudate nucleus and putamen in primates are organized according to patterns that are markedly different but also largely complementary to one another.

abstract = {The structure of bovine erythrocyte Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase has been determined to 2 Ãƒâ€¦ resolution using only the larger structure factors beyond 4 Ãƒâ€¦. The enzyme crystallizes in space group \{C2\} with two dimeric enzyme molecules per asymmetric unit. All four crystallographically independent subunits were fitted separately to the electron density map at 2 Ãƒâ€¦ resolution on the University of North Carolina GRIP-75 molecular graphics system. Atomic co-ordinates were refined using the Hendrickson &amp; Konnert (1980) program for stereochemically restrained refinement against structure factors, which allowed the use of non-crystallographic symmetry. The crystallographic residual error for the refined model was 25.5% with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.03 Ãƒâ€¦ from ideal bond lengths and an average atomic temperature factor of 12 Ãƒâ€¦2. Each enzyme subunit is composed primarily of eight antiparallel ÃŽÂ² strands that form a flattened cylinder, plus three external loops. The ÃŽÂ² barrel is asymmetrical and can be viewed as having two distinct sides; ÃŽÂ² strands 5 to 8 are shorter with fewer hydrogen bonds, less regular side-chain alternation, and greater twist than strands 1 to 4. The main-chain hydrogen bonds primarily link ÃŽÂ² strand residues; side-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds are extensively involved in the formation of tight turns, which form a major structural element of the three loops. The largest loop includes both a disulfide region and a Zn-liganding region, each of which resembles one of the other two loops in overall structure. The second largest loop includes a short section of ÃŽÂ± helix. The smallest loop forms a Greek key connection across one end of the ÃŽÂ² barrel. The single disulfide bond, which forms a left-handed spiral, covalently joins the largest loop to the beginning of ÃŽÂ² strand 8. Symmetrically related ÃŽÂ² bulge pairs fold the two large loops back against the external surface of the ÃŽÂ² barrel to surround the active channel. The active site Cu(II) and Zn(II) lie 6.3 Ãƒâ€¦ apart at the bottom of this long channel; the Zn is buried, while the Cu is solvent-accessible. The side-chain of His61 forms a bridge between the Cu and Zn and is coplanar with them within the current accuracy of the data. The Cu ligands \{ND1\} of His44 and \{NE2\} of His46, Ã¢Ë†â€™61 and Ã¢Ë†â€™118 show an uneven tetrahedral distortion from a square plane. The Cu has a fifth axial coordination position exposed to solvent. Zn ligands \{ND1\} of His61, Ã¢Ë†â€™69 and Ã¢Ë†â€™78 and \{OD1\} of Asp81 show tetrahedral geometry with a strong distortion toward a trigonal pyramid having the buried Asp81 at the apex. Both the side-chains and mainchains of the metal-liganding residues are stabilized in their orientation by a complex network of hydrogen bonds. "

abstract = {The development of innovations is increasingly portrayed as a dynamic interplay between two or more actors. This started with the seminal work of von Hippel concerning the role of users during the initial stages of the development cycle. Subsequent studies by numerous academics demonstrated the relevance of continuous interaction between the manufacturer and potential users. Swedish researchers, in particular, elaborated on the concept of manufacturer-user interaction by focusing on networks consisting of a number of different parties linked together by means of interactive relationships. However, most of the work in this area tends to be of a theoretical and conceptual nature. The research presented in this paper was designed especially to remedy this situation by studying the actual functioning of individual firms within such networks. The empirical data provided by the Dutch medical equipment industry describe the distribution of innovation across manufacturers, users and various third parties. The evidence points to the relevance of interacting with both potential users and various third parties. Nevertheless, essential differences exist between the interaction with both types of cooperation partners. A detailed case description furnishes substantial insight into the intricacies and pitfalls of developing industrial innovations within complex networks. "

abstract = {Oman has a long tradition of practising handicrafts, though few are of high aesthetic value. Omani handicrafts have always been functional, made for a rural population which has valued the artefacts for what they do but much less for their appearance. Nevertheless, handicraft skills are very widespread throughout the rural population. In the past they have been used to process raw materials of agricultural origin, notably from the date palm and from livestock, and also from wild trees and minerals. In addition to local resources, Omani craftsmen have worked imported cotton yarn and imported precious and semi-precious metals. The craftsmen not only provided equipment for rural producers and finished goods for domestic use but they also performed the important community roles of linking primary producer with primary producer and consumer, and making both more aware of the raw materials of the environment in which they lived. In doing this, craftsmen, with their mutually respected skills, played a vital role in creating the complex network of interdependencies from which a community is built. However, the Omani and other regional oil industries put great pressure on all rural activities, and particularly on the highly labour-intensive crafts. People sought work in the urban centres and in the armed forces at the same time as a flood of cheap imports prevented craftsmen from raising their prices to keep abreast of inflation and of heightened personal material aspirations. The impact of oil was so rapid that the craftsmen had no time to adapt their techniques or their products to meet the new circumstances. Craft growth and change needed government support to see it through a difficult transitional period. Unfortunately, however, the government of Oman has only played a small and somewhat confused role in the crafts. Many people can no longer practise their inherited skills and the role that they played in maintaining the community has been largely destroyed. Concentrated effort needs to be made, craft by craft, initially at a village scale, to train and to modify techniques where necessary and to expand market openings. Success in a single village can then form the basis of expanded regional or national projects, drawing in other resources such as credit from the Agricultural Bank and using the marketing networks of the Central Marketing Authority. An approach which has been used to redevelop spinning and weaving and to introduce irrigation channel manufacture in a coastal village in northern Oman is providing valuable information that could be used as the basis of other craft projects in Oman and in countries with comparable craft development problems.

abstract = {The measurement of health Why has so little been said about the measurement of levels of health in scientific gatherings on tropical medicine and hygiene? Is health perhaps a Ã¢â‚¬Å“disembodied concept which stimulates no emotional responseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Dubos, 1965). Health is a value embedded in a highly complex network of norms and attitudes of a given society and health is also dependent upon the interaction between the bio-physical environment and socio-economic development. So concepts about health may differ from a near total acceptance of disease and death as an inevitable natural phenomenon towards a continuous search for new ways of well-being. This may, at least partly, explain the reluctance to collect, analyse and compare different vital and health statistics on an international level, and the difficulty to develop new parameters for measuring levels of health. The scientific value of internationally available statistics about mortality, morbidity and other health parameters especially from developing countries is usually doubted. To challenge this assumption some 65 different health data and health-influencing factors were collected from official sources for 103 countries, developed as well as developing ones. 29 doctors, participating in the International Course in Health Development 1970Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1971, volunteered in this study. Many difficulties were encountered. It often occurred that data either were not available or were probably not in accordance with reality. In that case estimates or even Ã¢â‚¬Å“guestimatesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ had to be made. In spite of these limitations an attempt was made to discover general patterns in the levels of health of the various countries, when grouped into larger regions. These regions were the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia, including countries and territories in the Pacific. The crude death rate was shown to be a good health indicator for all the developing countries (notably in Africa), where the death rates, originally high, are decreasing. This indicator, however, completely looses its significance, when it starts to increase again as the result of the ageing of the population. The infant mortality rate was as expected lowest in Europe and highest in Africa with intermediate levels for Asia and the Americas. Childhood (1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ4 years of age) mortality, however, showed a different pattern. This rate was lowest again in Europe, intermediate for the Americas but generally very high, both for Africa and Asia. This would indicate that the risks to life in Asia are intermediate for infants but still considerable for the preschool child. In general the value of the various health parameters as indicators is very much dependent on the general level of development. The various health indicators are also influenced by bio-physical and socio-economic factors. Childhood mortality for instance appeared to be mostly correlated with per caput income and consumption of animal protein, annual increase of population and the incidence of infectious and parasitic diseases. Correlations and intercorrelations according to regions are being analysed. On this basis it seems possible to indicate to what extent the various health indicators are related to natural and man-made factors in the different phases of development. This would lead us to the possibility of health planning on a quantified statistical basis through pilot research projects for later implementation on a national, regional and international level. "

The dislocations are arranged in dense complex networks, which form boundaries between regions of relatively low dislocation density, the size of these regions decreasing with increasing deformation. Very large deformations result in the formation of discrete subgrains with large misorientations across the subgrain boundaries. Stacking faults occur in 3% silicon-iron on {112} planes, with a stacking fault energy &lt; 40 ergs/cm2. A correlation of flow stress measurements with dislocation density favours the forest intersection theory of work hardening, although dislocation pile ups have been observed. "

abstract = {Superconductors (SC) have been investigated with microwaves by registering the nonlinear response (RNR) as a function of the modulation field. Equidistant narrow lines in a single \{YBaCuO\} crystal found by electron spin resonance (ESR) could be registered by \{RNR\} as absorption bands. Some narrow lines are present or absent depending on sweep direction and excursion. In granular SC, thin \{YBaCuO\} films showed critical (junction) fields H* which are smaller (3ÃŽÂ¼T) than in bulk samples (5ÃŽÂ¼T). They are as small as in BiSrCaCuO bulk. Using \{RNR\} with intermittent modulation, the measured complex hysteresis response indicates a spin glass type of structure of the \{SC\} network, and it demonstrates that the usual narrow band \{ESR\} registers only prepared states and not initial states corresponding to the scanning field.

These molecules were chosen because they are structural components of anchoring fibrils, hemidesmosome-associated complexes, and anchoring filaments. The localization of type \{VII\} collagen in lichen planus was strikingly different from that in nonaffected mucosa or dermis or in other mucocutaneous lesions. In the normal mucosa, type \{VII\} collagen was localized only at the basement membrane zone. In lichen planus, type \{VII\} collagen was present not only in the basement membrane area but also in streaked patterns deep in the connective tissue. The hemidesmosome-associated complex, ÃŽÂ±6ÃŽÂ²4 integrin, was localized at the basal aspect of basal epithelial cells of nonaffected sites, hut was diffuse and discontinuous in lichen planus lesions. Most of the basal keratinocytes, however, stained for this integrin. Kalinin staining was discontinuous in lichen planus lesions. Often, finger-like projections of kalinin staining were found protruding into the connective tissue stroma. Kalinin was localized at the basement membrane zone of the nonaffected tissue and other mucocutaneous lesions. These results indicate that in cutaneous and mucosal lichen planus, the epithelial anchoring system is disturbed. "

The purpose of this study is to determine whether normal or diseased infrarenal aortas liberate the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-ÃŽÂ± (TNF-ÃŽÂ±) and interleukin-1ÃŽÂ² (IL-1ÃŽÂ²). Twenty-six infrarenal aortic biopsies (5 aortic occlusive disease, 15 abdominal aortic aneurysms, and 6 cadaveric donors) were weighed, minced into small pieces, and incubated in media for 48 hours. Conditioned media was harvested at 48 hours and assayed for IL-1ÃŽÂ² or TNF-ÃŽÂ± with use of an \{ELISA\} assay. Comparison of groups was performed with a one-way analysis of variance. The constitutive IL-1ÃŽÂ² produced by abdominal aortic aneurysms was significantly different than that in cadaveric donors (908 Ã‚Â± 194 pg/ml [SE] vs 100 Ã‚Â± 30 pg/ml). There was no statistically significant difference between abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortic occlusive disease (908 Ã‚Â± 194 pg/ml vs 604 Ã‚Â± 256 pg/ml) or aortic occlusive disease and cadaveric donor (604 Ã‚Â± 256 vs 100 Ã‚Â± 30). In time-course studies for the release of IL-1ÃŽÂ², abdominal aortic aneurysms demonstrated maximal release at 48 hours. IL-1ÃŽÂ² release was augmented by lipopolysaccharide in all categories. A dose response curve demonstrated maximal IL-1ÃŽÂ² release on stimulation with 5 ÃŽÂ¼g/ml LPS. Constitutive TNF-ÃŽÂ± production was low, ranging from 13 Ã‚Â± 1.5 pg/ml in cadaveric donor, to 20 pg/ml in aortic occlusive disease, and 24 Ã‚Â± 11 pg/ml in abdominal aortic aneurysms. There was no augmentation in TNF-ÃŽÂ± with lipopolysaccharide. These experiments demonstrate (1) A significant increase in the amount of constitutive IL-1ÃŽÂ² produced in abdominal aortic aneurysms as compared with cadaveric donor; (2) IL- 1ÃŽÂ² secretion is not different between aortic occlusive disease and abdominal aortic aneurysms, nor aortic occlusive disease and cadaveric donor; (3) TNF-ÃŽÂ± production is similar in all cases. We suggest that the inflammatory infiltrate found in infrarenal aortic disease produces cytokines that may contribute to the pathogenesis of the underlying disease.

We found large significant differences between these two effects only when disturbance levels were low or absent. We suggest that natural assemblages should be examined for the frequency of intransitive interactions along disturbance gradients in order to assess the significance of these competitive relationships. We also argue that intransitive competition ought to be incorporated into nonequilibrium disturbance models; diversification effects of disturbance and intransitive competition need not be mutually exclusive.

abstract = {Antibody-forming (plasma) cells and memory B cells are both generated during a humoral immune response in the spleen. Antibody-forming cells develop in the outer parts of the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheaths (PALS) while memory B cells develop in the lymphoid follicles. As soon as the first antibodies appear in the circulation, immune complexes are formed, the bulk of which are ingested by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. A small proportion, however, is immobilized on the processes of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). These immune complexes are thought to play a key role in the generation of memory B cells in the follicles. In this article Nico van Rooijen postulates that, in the continuing presence of soluble antigen, the newly generated memory B cells in the follicles may continue to differentiate into antibody-forming cells. Experimentally such conditions are fulfilled when adjuvants that slowly release antigen are used and when antigens used for immunization can replicate in the body. The postulated synergistic action of immobilized immune complexes and soluble antigen in the follicles may represent an efficient mechanism for the rapid production of large numbers of plasma cells.

Subsequently, the problems of describing context dependent networks are discussed in connection with the problem of how such networks can be controlled. The chapter describes several extreme types of networks to clarify some important distinctions. Hierarchical organizations strongly resemble strict hierarchies with respect to the distribution of controlling inputs. Thus, a hierarchical organization corresponds to a network in which units receive both informative and controlling inputs from higher units and send only informative outputs to higher units. A linear array has no particular problem of control in operating in real time because each unit is completely controlled by its predecessor. The problems of controlling networks of a less restricted class are discussed but the superordinate executive is still sketchy. "

The proposed algorithm repeats simulating a minimal cut set composed of the arcs which originate from the (new) source node and reducing the network on the basis of the states of simulated arcs until the s-t connectedness is confirmed. We develop the importance sampling estimator, the total hazard estimator and the hazard importance sampling estimator which are all based on the proposed algorithm, and compare the performance of these simulation estimators. It is found that these estimators can significantly reduce the variance of the raw simulation estimator and the usual importance sampling estimator. "

In the present study, we measured the release of \{ENK\} and ÃŽÂ²-EP by simultaneous push-pull perfusion of the N. accumbens and amygdala after microinjection of morphine into the PAG. Morphine administration elicited an increase in immunoreactive \{ENK\} and ÃŽÂ²-EP in both the N. accumbens and the amygdala, which was antagonized in each nucleus by perfusion with naloxone. These data suggest that the three nuclei were not serially connected and that they may take part in one and the same antinociceptive system with an Ã¢â‚¬Å“all or noneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ character. "

Intra-amygdaloid injection of morphine increased the release of enkephalins and ÃŽÂ²-endorphin in the \{PAG\} and N. accumbens. When the perfusion fluid contained 3 ÃŽÂ¼M of naloxone, the release of enkephalins and ÃŽÂ²-endorphin was reduced in both the \{PAG\} and the N. accumbens. These results do not support the hypothesis of a unidirectional loop and its putative sequence. "

Here we report that \{H7\} is also active on human nb cell lines. The human nb cell had originally neuroblast-like (N) or intermediate (I) morphology. N and I type are thought to represent different stages of neuroblastoma differentiation. Neurite outgrowth was observed in both N and I type morphology treating the cells with 7, 14 or 28 ÃŽÂ¼M of H7. The results confirm previous observations and show that inhibition of \{PKC\} by \{H7\} also promotes neuronal differentiation in human cell line variants. "

A typical example of such devices is an electronic diode, an electric switch, a relay, a fluid flow valve, etc. The networks made up of such devices present a complication in the reliability analysis as the networks become more complex. This paper presents a newly developed graphical technique to analyse any type of simple or complex three-state device network with much simplicity, straightforwardness and limited reliability theory knowledge. The theory behind this newly developed technique is briefly explained and the rules to use this technique are established. Some numerical examples are presented and compared with the results obtained from the conventional method. The graphical and conventional results compare quite favourably. "

The temporal distribution of the peak traffic is the result of commuters' selections of departure times. The stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model is one of the techniques for estimating this distribution, but is computationally cumbersome to apply. In addition, existence and uniqueness of the solution to the \{SUE\} formulation and its approximations have not been proven. The \{ISUE\} is another approximation to the SUE, and it is based on an approach for which existence and uniqueness of the solution have been established. "

abstract = {In this experimental study, the authors examined the role ofvarious cytokines in the development of cancer cachexia. After in vitro culture and selection of a single clone of tumor cells, a growing uterine cervical carcinoma from human origin was implanted subcutaneously in nude mice. Body weight and tumor volume were measured throughout the study period; tissue wasting was assessed by weighing the gastrocnemius muscle and the periovarian white adipose tissue. Serum and tumor cytokine concentrations, including human G-CSF, murine and human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Ã¢Ë†ï¿½, IFN-ÃŽÂ³, interleukin (IL)-1Ã¢Ë†ï¿½ and IL-6, were determined by \{ELISA\} at the end of the study. Two months after implantation, the tumor (4% of carcass weight) induced severe loss of adipose tissue (Ã¢Ë†â€™95%) and muscle mass (Ã¢Ë†â€™49%). Human IL-6 (0.38 Ã‚Â± 0.19 ng/ml) and human G-CSF were detected in the serum and the tumor tissue of these animals; none of the cytokines of murine origin was detected in the serum, except IL-6 (0.14 Ã‚Â± 0.05 ng/ml). Treatment with neutralizing anti-human IL-6 antibodies reduced plasma IL-6 and G-CSF levels and significantly increased host carcass weight (16%) and fat mass (353%). The authors conclude that human IL-6 produced by tumor cells is an essential mediator of cachexia in this model. "

The participation of these cells in rapid rejection of abnormal fetuses and possible cytolitic activity of these cells to trophoblasts seems unlikely. But, their production of cytokines (like CSF-1, which promote differentiation and growth of trophoblasts cells) may be the primary role of decidual \{NK\} cells in time of establishment of fetal-maternal connection. Later, inactivation of decidual \{NK\} cells by prostaglandins prevents damage of embryos. "

An in vitro model was developed in which full-thickness skin from various species can be cultured (rabbit, pig and human). Subsequent to topically applied test compounds, parameters of dermal toxicity were investigated, including cytotoxicity (MTT assay) and the release of inflammatory mediators (HETE's). Moreover, percutaneous absorption and concurrent biotransformation of compounds was studied. \{MTT\} conversion was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner following topical application of a wide range of irritants. Repair of initial damage was observed to some extent. The eicosanoid 12-HETE, which is thought to play an important role in chemotaxis, is released. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory mediator 15-HETE was released only after a prolonged culture time of 48 hr, possibly indicating repair of the induced damage. The metabolic fate of the pesticide propoxur was investigated. Permeation rates were comparable in human and rabbit skin, while pig skin was found to be twice as permeable. Extensive cutaneous metabolism was observed in all three species. "

Under the culture conditions used, the glial cells differentiated and formed a complex cellular network on the floor of the culture vessels from which glial-glial and glial-neuronal contacts could be seen. Single-channel currents from cell-attached glial membrane patches were recorded using the gigaseal technique. Depolarisation of membrane patches activated outward currents, which were abolished in the presence of extracellular 50 mM tetraethylammonium or 5 mM 4-aminopyridine, and were insensitive to 1 ÃŽÂ¼M tetrodotoxin, 10 ÃŽÂ¼M picrotoxin and 2 mM Cd2. The amplitude of the outward currents increased linearly with depolarisation, and amplitude histograms obtained at several pipette potentials could be reasonably fitted with a single Gaussian corresponding to a single channel type with a slope conductance of 37 Ã‚Â± 11 pS. The extrapolated equilibrium potential of the outward current was about 5 Ã‚Â± 10 mV positive to the resting potential and both the channel open time constant and relative open time probability were sensitive to membrane potential, increasing markedly with depolarisation. The results presented in this paper show the presence of a cadmium-insensitive, voltage-dependent outward potassium channel in insect glial cells in vitro. "

Although *Cr(bpy)33+ is quenched by phenol (kq = 8.0 Ãƒâ€” 106 MÃ¢Ë†â€™1 sÃ¢Ë†â€™1), there is no evidence of redox products. The results suggest that singlet oxygen, generated in the quenching of *Cr(bpy)33+ by O2, is the mediator of the formation of BQ. "

This contention has important implications for the localization of memory functions. Recent literature on the anatomical basis and mechanism of memory is reviewed. Memory probably resides in multifocal neural networks rather than in specific anatomical sites. "

The approach addresses the problem as a multi-task effort and applies a decomposition scheme which makes use of both mathematical programming and pinch analysis methods. The different tasks include targets for structural modifications and heat transfer area changes, the development and optimisation of the retrofitted network and the analysis of its complexity against economic penalties and trade-offs. The decomposition stages embed targeting information which supports screening and facilitates an effective optimisation search. As such, the decomposition not only bypasses the limitations of past decomposition techniques but exploits its features toward the development of an interactive design tool. "

Because the number of inter-processor connections is limited, the communication between any two processors is made by passing the messages through several other processors and then, a problem of messages routing appears. For dedicated systems, special architectures can be defined simplifying the problem but, if an environment constituting a basis for general applications development is desired, the problem is more serious due to the deadlock possibility. A general router, able to avoid the problem, becomes then a very important tool for software development in parallel architectures. We have been defining a development platform, based on a network of Transputers and written in OCCAM, for image synthesis applications. This paper reports our efforts in writing different versions of routers, based on two different strategies, and justifies the choice of an efficient one to integrate in the platform. "

We examined the use of PERCEPTRON, ADALINE, \{MADALINE\} and BACK-PROPAGATION networks. The results were encouraging. Within short prediction time spans (10 days), we achieved a very hight degree of accuracy of up to 90%. With a BACK-PROPAGATION network we carried out an absolute-value prediction. The network was thereby able to recognize on its own an obvious heuristic and showed a behaviour similar to the exponential smoothing algorithm. The results we achieved led us to expect that neural network could considerably improve the prognosis of stock prices (and more generally, the prognosis of semi-chaotic time series) in the future. Nevertheless considerable improvements are needed in the theory of neural networks, as practicable methods to support the design of neural networks for specific applications are not available yet. "

abstract = {This paper considers a controller which optimizes the machining process using a decision-making approach. This approach provides a framework in which artificial intelligence techniques can operate in conjunction with operations research concepts. The proposed intelligent controller uses a multiple-sensor approach for process monitoring. The paper focuses on the module which integrates the sensor-based information in order to provide the controller with the best possible estimates for the tool wear and wear rate. Several approaches are considered for the sensor-integration module. These techniques include a neural network, least-squares regression, and the group method of data handling (GMDH) algorithm. These techniques were determined to be the most promising and feasible approaches for developing this module. Force, temperature and acoustic emission signals recorded during tool wear experiments were used to evaluate the sensor-integration techniques. The results of these tests indicate that the sensor-integration approach proposed in this work will provide more accurate estimates of the tool wear than the single-sensor approach typically used in machining control.

We encountered six such patients in a series of 765 carotid endarterectomies (0.8%). These arteries are named for the cranial nerves with which they run. The most commonly found vessel is the trigeminal artery, followed by the hypoglossal and proatlantal intersegmental arteries. The primitive otic artery is the rarest of the four anomalous vessels. These vessels are usually large and are associated with hypoplasia or aplasia of the normal intracranial anastomotic channels. Cerebral ischemia is common during temporary intraoperative carotid occlusion and was encountered in two of three patients who had intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring. Thus cerebral ischemia should be anticipated during carotid cross-clamping and cerebral protective measures should be instituted when persistent primitive cranial vessels are encountered. "

The indicated land surface bend can be measured by repeating geodetic measurements.

Moreover, with the exception of AsA-Na, ail treatments that induced an elevation of \{DNA\} synthesis also caused morphological epithelial alterations as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Treatment with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) did not result in any proliferative response of the rat renal pelvis. No treatment-related changes in urinary \{PGE2\} and cyclic \{AMP\} were noted, although AsA-Na and AsA but not NaHCO3 reduced levels of \{LPO\} and \{MDA\} in the urine. The results indicate that while the response of renal pelvic epithelium to certain bladder cancer promoters is similar to that of the bladder itself, none of the urinary cellular growth or free radical biochemical parameters is directly related to urothelial cell proliferation.

The material deposited in culture contained type \{IV\} collagen, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence labeling using anti-type \{IV\} collagen antibodies and formed delicate networks. Fine filaments and granules composing this network were interpreted respectively as linear and globular \{NCI\} domains of the type \{IV\} collagen molecule. These loose networks were considered as first steps in basement membrane assembly. Staggered superimposition of comparable networks could lead to the dense network organization as observed for basement membranes in situ. These observations showed that the basement membrane of the chick embryo corneal epithelium is also organized in a complex polygonal framework that is preserved even when secreted in cultrue conditions.

abstract = {Frequency dependence of conductivity for reticulate doped systems is observed at room temperature only around 1 \{GHz\} and even so it is relatively weak. The temperature dependence of conductivity is characteristic of the \{CT\} complex used and not of the polymer matrix. For the system containing TTF-TCNQ, for which the d.c. conductivity has a maximum at c. 230 K (i.e. metal-like behaviour at higher temperatures), this maximum becomes more pronounced and shifts towards lower temperatures with increasing frequency in the \{GHz\} range. The temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity is weaker than that of the d.c. conductivity. Such behaviour can be described by a modified Maxwell-Wagner model if an appropriate shape factor for the conducting inclusions is introduced, and if a relatively high conductivity of the continuous phase is assumed. We conclude that charge-carrier transport in reticulate doped polymers is not controlled by insulating barriers. The disorder within microcrystals plays a fundamental role, while the \{CT\} complex crystalline network is continuous in spite of very low concentration. "

With the help of this model some problems of the control and simulation will be discussed. A typical simulation run will also be presented. "

Bi- and multi-polar cells appeared, expressing acetylcholinesterase and neurofilament proteins but not markers of glial differentiation including GFA-protein. Nerve growth factor combined with both retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic \{AMP\} greatly enhanced the development of neuron-like morphology and induced expression of immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase as well as to Leu-encephalin-like peptides. Similarly, serotonin-like immunofluorescence but not substance P-like immunoreactivity was demonstrable in such cultures. In addition, synaptic-like vesicles were often found in the processes. Analysis of matrix expression in neuronally differentiated \{F9\} cells revealed marked increase in laminin production, as judged by immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy, but no demonstrable intracellular staining for fibronectin or type \{IV\} collagen. The results with neuronal cells contrast with the expression of all the three matrix components in endodermally differentiating \{F9\} cells in the same cultures. "

As the first step towards understanding the mechanisms of cellular injury induced by these sensitizers, we have studied by fluorescence microscopy the effects of 13 halogenated (nitro)benzene derivatives on microtubule organization in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and human \{AG1522\} skin fibroblasts. Untreated cells have numerous microtubules distributed in a network fashion throughout the cytoplasm and extending to the cell periphery. Exposing cells for 3 hr to micromolar doses of halogenated nitrobenzene derivatives, which induce allergic contact dermatitis in guinea-pigs and man, resulted in a dose-dependent disassembly of microtubules. In contrast, incubation with 10Ã¢â‚¬â€œ70 times higher doses of seven halogenated (nitro)benzene derivatives that do not sensitize guinea-pigs or man, had no discernible effect on microtubule organization of both cell types under identical assay conditions. Thus, for the 13 halogenated (nitro)benzene derivatives tested in this study, a 100% positive correlation exists between the sensitizing capacity as determined by in vivo tests on guinea-pigs and man (Landsteiner and Jacobs, 1936) and the ability to cause microtubule disassembly in cultured cells. These results may provide the basis for developing an in vitro screening assay for identifying other potential halogenated nitrobenzene sensitizers. In addition, these studies represent a new approach to investigating the mechanisms of contact sensitivity induced by simple chemicals. "

This calls for an improved understanding not only of the basics of the individual processes but also of their interrelationships and hence of the synergistic effects to be expected from multiprocess integration. Another trend is towards investigating even the most complex oil processes at the molecular level. This includes the characterization of both feedstocks and products in terms of individual or grouped molecular components. This approach has been shown to facilitate process integration and to result in the development of process models which are more soundly based on physical/chemical principles and are thus more powerful than the conventional models. The validity of this approach is substantiated by process integration studies, the use of catalyst modules, product quality/performance correlations and model validations both in the laboratory and in the refinery. It is perceived that process models will play an increasingly important role in the transfer of technology between the laboratory and the design office. A major challenge in the future will be to develop models which can also contribute to the innovative phase in the research laboratory. "

The feeds and products were characterized by capillary-column gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector and a Hall electrical conductivity detector, the latter being sulphur- or nitrogen-specific. The results were used to determine quantitative kinetics of the hydroprocessing reactions of individual compounds in the coal-derived liquids under the conditions of potential industrial processes.

Both thin (type II) and thick (type I) fibers are labeled by extracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the auditory nerve. Type I and almost all type \{II\} fibers bifurcate upon reaching the auditory nerve root of the cochlear nucleus. For a given bundle of auditory nerve fibers labeled by a discrete injection of HRP, bifurcations of type \{II\} and type I fibers are restricted to a narrow region of the nerve root. After the bifurcation, the pathways of type \{II\} branches within the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN) are similar to those of type I branches. This similarity in bifurcation and course of type I and type \{II\} fibers was observed in the ventral as well as dorsal parts of the ventral cochlear nucleus. The complete axonal course of most type \{II\} fibers could not be reconstructed, however, due to fading of the reaction product. Type \{II\} fibers produce very few collaterals in the cochlear nucleus (CN), but possess many Ã¢â‚¬Ëœen passantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ swellings along their main processes and collaterals. Compared with type \{II\} fibers previously studied in mice (Berglund and Brown, 1989; 1994; Brown and Ledwith, 1990), cat type \{II\} fibers are similar in their general projections within the main body of the nucleus and in the frequency of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœen passantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ swellings per length of fiber, but cat fibers have a higher percentage of Ã¢â‚¬ËœcomplexÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or pedunculated Ã¢â‚¬Ëœen passantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ swellings.

Phase separation in films prepared from solutions in 1,2-dichlorobenzene results in nano-scale crystallites of \{C60\} (dimensions approximately 10 nm or even less), embedded in amorphous MEH-PPV. A very fine bicontinuous network structure forms for MEH-PPV:C60 compositions near 1:1 by weight. This homogeneous nanostructured network morphology in the polymer composites confirms the formation of a bulk heterojunction material as inferred from the improved optical and electronic properties of these composites in device applications.

The tissue was fixed with osmium tetroxide and embedded in methacrylate or Araldite. The synaptic regions were localized by using thick sections of osmium fixed, methacrylate-embedded material. Electron micrographs demonstrate that collateral processes from the afferent giant axons are synaptically connected with the efferent giant axons to form the giant synapse. The proximal synapse is set up between the synaptic endings of the accessory giant fiber and the collateral processes of the axons originating in the ganglion cells. Both synapses, giant and proximal, are characterized by the presence of mitochondria, microvesicles, a homogeneous dense substance, increased osmiophilia and thickening of the pre- and postsynaptic membranes. Two types of microvesicles were visible. The synaptic organelles were constantly found in the presynaptic cytoplasm. This fact seems to be consistent with the physiological findings about the polarity of the giant synapse. The morphological polarization of the proximal synapse suggests a functional polarity similar to that found for the giant synapse. "

It modulates a range of properties of endothelial cells, monocytes, and neutrophils in vitro, and induces an acute inflammatory reaction and tumour regression in vivo. Recent evidence suggests that \{EMAP\} \{II\} can induce apoptosis in endothelial cells, and as such may act in an anti-angiogenic role. The question arises whether \{EMAP\} \{II\} is primarily a pro-inflammatory cytokine or a novel mediator of programmed cell death. "

Among the fastest methods of computing Rs,t is the path method. In enumerates all minimal sÃ¢Ë†â€™t paths of the net and then makes the paths mutually disjoint. Unfortunately, all paths and all disjoint terms must be available (stored) at the same time. Therefore, the computer memory effort for that method increases exponentially. In contrast, the reliability branching algorithm (RBA) that builds up a branching tree with disjoint tree-nodes (corresponding to the terms of a symbolic reliability expression) is also effective and needs only a low, quadratically increasing memory effort. The present paper gives a new method for symbolic reliability analysis. It is a fusion of the \{RBA\} with the path method. We search for one sÃ¢Ë†â€™t path and compute its reliability. Then we formulate conditions that ensure disjointness for all paths we search on that condition and so on. A condition always reduces the network. The new method combines the advantages of the path method (fast) and the \{RBA\} (low memory effort). The algorithm is simple for computation by hand and effective for the use of computers. "

The \{RPE\} has many important roles in vision and retinal physiology including mediating nutrient exchange between the choroidal capillaries and the neural retina, maintaining retinal attachment by conducting fluid and ion transport in the vitreal to retinal direction, and phagocytosing discs shed from the photoreceptors in the continuing process of outer segment renewal. The development of the \{RPE\} and the execution of its functions are inextricably dependent on the development and maintenance of its cytoskeleton. As in most animal cells, and probably all nucleated eukaryotic cells, the cytoskeleton consists of three components: (1) microtubules, (2) microfilaments, and (3) intermediate filaments. These components are composed of polymers of protein subunits and are dynamic in the sense that they can rapidly polymerize and depolymerize. This chapter describes the dynamics, function and location of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments in RPE. Each of the cytoskeletal elements is well represented in RPE. "

Potato starch has been processed by extrusion with glycerol and water added as plasticizers. The thermoplastic starch consists of a molecular network of semicrystalline amylose and amylopectin with some granular fragments. A rapid increase in B-type crystallinity and a change in mechanical properties is observed within 2 weeks at 70 and 90% relative humidities. An increase in B-type crystallinity from 5 to 30% compared to native potato starch leads to an increased elastic modulus (from 10 to 70 MPa) and tensile stress (from 3 to 7 MPa) for thermoplastic starch materials with a water content of circa 15%. The elongation is decreased from 105 to 55%. For materials with more than 30% B-type crystallinity relative to native potato starch, a sharp decrease in elongation is observed and the materials form cracks. The effects are explained by an increase in physical cross-links by amylose and amylopectin intermolecular double helix formation and crystallization resulting in a reinforced network. A further intramolecular crystallization of the amorphous amylopectin reduces the intermolecular interactions of amylopectin and induces internal stress within the network of semicrystalline amylose and amylopectin. The increased internal stress at the highly crystalline amylopectin sites finally leads to cracking of the materials. "

abstract = {In the management of a project, the project duration can often be compressed by accelerating some of its activities at an additional expense. This is the so-called time-cost tradeoff problem which has been studied extensively in the project management literature. However, the discrete version of the problem, encountered frequently in practice and also useful in modeling general time-cost relationships, has received only scant and sporadic attention. Prompted by the present emphasis on time-based competition and recent developments concerning problem complexity and solution, we reexamine this important problem in this paper. We begin by formally describing the problem and discussing the difficulties associated with its solution. We then provide an overview of the past solution approaches, identify their shortcomings, and present a new solution approach. Next, we present network decomposition/reduction as a convenient basis for solving the problem and analyzing its difficulty. Finally, we point to several new directions for future research, where we highlight the need for developing and evaluating effective procedures for solving the general time-cost tradeoff problem. To the best of our knowledge, the popular project management software packages do not include provisions for time-cost tradeoff analyses. Our work, we hope, will provide the groundwork and an incentive for alleviating this deficiency. "

Any \{BFN\} can be seen as a block and connected to other \{BFNs\} using a fixed number of elementary connections. The result of such a connection can also be considered as a block, and connected to other blocks, in a recursive fashion. We develop a cost-minimizing, supervised training algorithm for this model. The algorithm is a gradient-descent type, and is tailored on the block structure of the model. Finally, we present some experiments of use of BFNs. "

This has led to increased efforts in search for more fast exact techniques as well as better approximate methods. This paper proposes an algorithm for determining improved (tighter) upper and lower bounds on system reliability of general (i.e. non-series-parallel) systems. The proposed algorithm, like most existing methods, requires the knowledge of all simple paths and minimal cutsets of the system. The system success (failure) function is the union of all simple paths (minimal cutsets). The system success and failure functions are then modified to multinominal form and these expressions are interpreted as proper probability expressions using some approximations. The proposed algorithm gives better bounds as compared to the min-max method, the method of successive bounds, Esary-Proschan bounds and Shogan bounds and is illustrated by an example. "

Tunnelling spectra taken at T = 14 K can be explained with a single-particle model based on occurrence probabilities of the Pmn21 space group. Direct intramolecular coupling of methyl groups probably rescales the effective rotational potentials derived. At lower temperatures tunnelling spectra become more complex as the system transforms into an unknown phase with lower symmetry. "

This process is co-ordinated by hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that regulate the secretion of the glucocorticoids that are responsible for chronic adaptation of the animals metabolism. This report summarizes the results of studies investigating the influence of the active immunization of animals against the adrenal stimulatory hormone \{ACTH\} on carcass composition, endocrine function and energy metabolism in growing lambs. Decreases in carcass fatness in \{ACTH\} immune animals were associated with greater sensitivity in growth hormone (GH) and insulin secretion to stress, however, no differences in feed conversion efficiency or nitrogen balance were found. \{ACTH\} immunization did increase energetic efficiency by up to 20% during exercise as assessed by the consumption of oxygen, particularly when the exercise was intensive which suggests that the animal resorted to anaerobic processes to generate sufficient energy. This difference in oxygen consumption was partly attributable to changes in both cortisol and endorphin status, since the replacement of cortisol in immune animals and the blockade of ÃŽÂ¼ and ÃŽÂ£ opioid receptors with naloxone decreased the difference in oxygen consumption between the treatment groups. It would appear that immunologically induced changes in the stress hormone status of ruminants has a marked influence on metabolic efficiency and therefore productivity of sheep. "

Electron microscopy of the tunica media showed a number of immunoreactive nerve endings in the vicinity of local smooth muscle cells. Among the cranial ganglia that innervate the basilar artery, only the trigeminal ganglion had bFGF-immunoreactivity neurons. Nerve cells and fibers with NADPH-diaphorase activity were detected in the basilar artery and in the sphenopalatine and trigeminal ganglia, and the co-localization of bFGF and NADPH-diaphorase was noted only in the trigeminal ganglion. Furtheremore, Fluoro-gold tracing in combination with bFGF immunohistochemistry demonstrated that bFGF-containing nerve fibers in the wall of the basilar artery arise from the trigeminal ganglion.

We suggest that metabolic shifts during the complex growth cycle of these filamentous bacteria, and possibly secondary metabolic pathways, may be controlled by the action of protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, as has been demonstrated in signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic organisms.

In this report we present further details regarding a 1-step, non-mitogen requiring assay for specific antibody synthesis combining microculture and enzyme-linked immunoassay techniques. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from recently immunized subjects are cultured in antigen-coated plastic wells and the specific antibody produced and adhered to the solid-phase antigen is measured in an enzyme-linked immunoassay. The production of specific antibody in vitro did not occur in lymphocyte preparations that were frozen, thawed and incubated, nor did it occur in cultures containing puromycin. T cell separation and remixture experiments indicated that T cells provide significant augmentation under the conditions of this assay. It is apparent that the antibody measured was synthesized in vitro and that cell-cell interactions are operant. The assay may prove useful in the assessment of immune competence and in determining in vitro the effect of certain biologic response modifiers on antibody production. "

abstract = {Heart failure is not a distinct disease, but rather a complex clinical syndrome that can result from virtually any form of heart disease. The so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“end stagesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of heart failure do not respect etiologic boundaries. Patients are characterized clinically by extreme cardiomegaly, breathlessness, and fluid retention. Despite recent advances in the pharmacologic management of congestive heart failure, it remains a highly lethal and disabling disorder. Only through an improved understanding of the basic biology of the early stages of the syndrome can heart failure be prevented or at least forestalled. There is now intense interest in understanding the mechanisms operative in early left ventricular remodeling, which has the potential to culminate in end-stage heart failure. The study of animal models has been particularly useful in this regard, as have clinical studies performed in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction. The remodeling process is characterized by myocyte loss and segmental scarring, interstitial fibrosis, myocardial slippage, and myocyte hypertrophy. Although the mechanisms responsible for these topographic changes are as yet unclear, the net result is progressive enlargement of the heart, culminating in severe left ventricular dysfunction. A long-held view that cardiomegaly is a necessary adaptive process that maintains stroke volume in the presence of a falling ejection fraction has been challenged, although undoubtedly the early responses to myocardial injury in the form of myocyte hypertrophy and maintenance of wall stress are useful adaptations. However, as the left ventricle continues to dilate and hypertrophy over time, a form of overadjustment occurs that perhaps is an important contributory factor toward end-stage failure. Current therapeutic strategies designed to modify this process include the use of pharmacologic agents designed to optimize loading conditions and reduce myocyte hypertrophy. Although we are only now beginning to understand the underpinnings of progressive left ventricular remodeling, It is apparent that this is a potentially modifiable process. "

The notion that olfactory transduction might also utilize an adenylate-cyclase-mediated temporal coincidence circuit strengthens the idea that signal integration via temporal-coincidence pathways is a universal feature of all neural adenylate cyclases.

We found that, contrary to \{GH\} responses to GHRH, estrogen-treated rats (one single injection of 200 ÃŽÂ¼g s.c. of estradiol valerate, 3 days before the experiment), exhibited markedly increased \{GH\} responses to different doses of \{NT\} (7.5, 15 and 30 ÃŽÂ¼g/kg, i.v.). The stimulatory effect of \{NT\} (30 ÃŽÂ¼/kg) on estrogen-treated rats was similar in rats that received normal rabbit serum or passively immunized with antisomatostatin or anti-GHRH serum.

abstract = {Heterogeneous olefin polymerization increasingly dominates the production of polyethylene, polypropylene and mixed polyolefins. Our studies of the morphology of these catalysts reveal that several different mechanisms occur for the changes in the accessible active surface, the void volume and the distribution of catalytically active particles within the growing polymer. These differences in morphological dynamics are dictated by the initial catalyst pore structure and the related subsequent catalyst fragmentation processes. MgCl2 supported catalyst tend to be uniform in their microporosity (i.e., Ã¢Ë†Â¼ 4 nm); although, there is evidence for multi-modal ÃŽÂ¼-pore dimension due to the agglomeration of small subparticles. The initial fragmentation proceeds readily and uniformly to yield a multi-grain growth of sub-particle agglomerates. The surface of these sub-particle agglomerates is accessible through the void-space between growing catalyst/particle grains. Silica supported catalysts exhibit a network of porosity from meso- to micro-pores. These catalysts fragment progressively from the larger to the smaller meso-pores following the filling of the available pore space with growing polymer. Since this fragmentation is progressive and is dictated by pore filling, the surface area and pore volume can decrease rapidly. In the extreme, these mechanisms result in both loss and retention of available surface area and pore volume. As the polymer grows these differences can result in uniform as well as non-uniform distributions of catalyst fragments within the growing polymer. However, the differences between the morphological mechanisms can depend on the conditions (pressure, temperature and gas phase v.s. slurry) of the polymerization process and, thus, no simple conclusions may be drawn that relate one catalyst system to a specific mechanism for the changes in morphology.

Morphologic and biochemical studies have shown that tissue-specific aggregates of \{C7\} dimers called anchoring fibrils may contribute to epithelial basement membrane organization and adherence by interacting with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as type \{IV\} collagen. In this study, we cloned a cDNA encoding most of the \{NC1\} domain of C7. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed motifs characteristic of multidomain \{ECM\} proteins that contribute to the tissue-specific organization of \{ECM\} including a region of 7Ã‚Â½ sequential fibronectin type \{III\} (Fn III) homology repeats, a potential collagen-binding region homologous to the A domain of von Willebrand factor (vWf) and an \{RGD\} sequence. A purified \{C7\} fusion protein containing these motifs specifically bound to type \{IV\} collagen in a functional assay. These results suggest that regions within the \{NC1\} domain of \{C7\} mediate interactions with lamina densa and dermal \{ECM\} proteins including type \{IV\} collagen. Structural mutations and autoepitopes in these regions may represent mechanisms for the development of defective basement membrane organization and adherence in genetic and autoimmune forms of epidermolysis bullosa.

abstract = {Several experiments have demonstrated low collagenolytic activity during the development of pulmonary fÃƒÂ¬brosis. In order to determine if fibroblasts play a role in this alteration, procollagenase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) were quantified in fibroblasts derived from 12 human lung specimens (normal = 6, idiopathic pulmonary fÃƒÂ¬brosis [IPF] = 6). Under basal conditions, three cell strains from normal and three from fibrotic lung specimens did not synthesize collagenase and a similar number of normal and IPF-derived fÃƒÂ¬broblast strains produced the enzyme. However, the rate of enzyme synthesis among normal and fibrotic collagenase producing fibroblasts exhibited significant differences. Thus, whereas normal fibroblasts produced more than 300 ng/ml, fibrotic lung fibroblasts secreted approximately half of this amount (115 Ã‚Â±67 ng/ml). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) enhanced collagenase production in all of the 12 lung fÃƒÂ¬broblast lines tested. In four \{IPF\} fibroblasts, \{PMA\} increased collagenase secretion close to those of normal stimulated lung fibroblasts; however, a lower induction was observed in cell strains from two fibrotic lung specimens. There was a wide variation in \{TIMP\} production both in normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts, and no statistically significant difference was observed. Under basal conditions, \{TIMP\} levels ranged from 329 to 16,911 ng/ml in normal lung cells, and from 377 to 17,557 in fibrotic lung fibroblasts. \{PMA\} induced a several-fold increase in all cell lines. These results suggest that there are subpopulations of lung fibroblasts with different potential to produce collagenase and \{TIMP\} in vitro, and that the predominance of low collagenase-producing subsets may contribute to the development of fÃƒÂ¬brosis.

Methods:Ã‚Â The blood vessel equivalent was constructed with the three following human cell types: vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. A tissuelike structure was obtained from the contraction of a tubular collagen gel (human origin) by vascular smooth muscle cells, which created a media-like structure. An adventia- like tissue was added around the media-like structure by embedding fibroblasts into a collagen gel. An endothelium was established within the tubular structure after intraluminal cell seeding. Results:Ã‚Â Cell orientation and gel contraction were followed up over time. Vascular smooth muscle cells developed a complex tridimensional network and were oriented in a circular fashion around the tube's axis. In contrast, fibroblasts were randomly oriented. A viable, homogeneous, and well-characterized endothelium was observed. These endothelial cells showed a slightly elongated structure and were oriented parallel to this vascular equivalent axis. Conclusion:Ã‚Â An in vitro tridimensional vascular model that exhibits some phenotypic characteristics of in vivo vascular cells could be useful in the study of events that lead to atherosclerotic plaque formations.

abstract = {The high recurrence rate of thyroglossal duct cyst operations is well documented. Sistrunk's operation is widely accepted as the best procedure to prevent recurrence. Nonetheless, the optimum depth of core-out is still not well documented. We previously reported a standard running pattern of the thyroglossal duct in an anatomical reconstruction study. In more detailed pathological studies, we have tried to determine the optimal depth for core-out toward foramen cecum and the optimal width of the hyoid bone to be resected. The following items were clarified. (1) Double the horizontal distance from midline to the most distant thyroglossal duct in front of the hyoid bone was 2.4 to 9.6 mm. (2) The length of the single duct above the hyoid bone which spreads into many ductuli as it approaches the foramen cecum was about 3 to 5 mm in 2-to 6-year old children. (3) The diameter of the thyroglossal duct at the level of the cranial top of the hyoid bone was 175 to 1,400 ÃŽÂ¼m. Half of the examined cases were less than 500 ÃŽÂ¼m, which may have rendered direct dissection impossible. Based on these studies, we propose: (1) that a minimum of 10 mm of the hyoid bone should be resected, and for the sake of safety, more than 15 mm is preferable; and (2) that the depth of the core-out should be less than 5 mm in young children to avoid the breakdown of the branched ductuli near the foramen cecum.

Since cyclosporin A can profoundly influence lymphocyte activation, it is appropriate to consider this drug as a novel anti-asthma therapy. Inhalation of low doses of cyclosporin A strongly inhibits the influx of inflammatory cells into the airways during acute allergic reactions, even though associated bronchospasm and airway hyper-reactivity are undiminished. It is suggested that cyclosporin A will be an effective anti-asthma therapy with an anti-asthma profile resembling that of established glucocorticosteroids. "

The lesion was successfully treated by transcatheter embolization following two unsuccessful surgical procedures.

Knowledge of the anatomic differences between this rare congenital \{APVM\} and the more commonly occurring arterial-portal fistula is crucial in planning effective transcatheter embolotherapy or surgery for these lesions.

Hence, it is desirable to encourage traffic patterns in which the frequency and severity of conflicts are minimised. At present, neither signal optimisation programs nor traffic simulation programs allow the user to experiment freely with different combinations of one-way streets and turn restrictions, which might otherwise help to disentangle conflicting movements. There is no accepted formula or philosophy for organising traffic into a coherent spatial pattern. The aim of this paper is to consider some idealised networks and circulation systems that have simple geometrical configurations, and to identify those systems that are relatively efficient in terms of path crossings, as compared with a theoretical yardstick derived from graph theory. The results provide some pointers towards a general strategy for efficient traffic circulation in urban areas. "

abstract = {The quantitative autoradiographic method with L-(35S)methionine was applied to investigate the effect of chronic dehydration on rates of protein synthesis in circumventricular organs (CVOs). Water deprivation for 1, 2 and 3 days causes progressive increases of protein synthesis in the subfornical organ (SFO), the area postrema, the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis and the neurohypophysis. Chronic salt ingestion with 2% NaCl in drinking water for 3 days resulted in increases of protein synthesis in the \{CVOs\} similar to those found after 3 days water deprivation, with only one exception, the SFO, in which the rise in protein synthesis was of lower amplitude after 3 days salt ingestion as compared to 3 days water deprivation. These results suggest that several circulating factors related to intracellular dehydration and the high plasma levels of the neurohormones vasopressin and oxytocin are probably important determinants of the rise of protein synthesis in circumventricular organs. Alternatively, the elevated level of blood-borne angiotensin \{II\} may well explain the higher metabolic response of the \{SFO\} following water deprivation compared to salt ingestion. "

Previous studies have identified six target response elements to which the factors of the family bind with various affinities. They are palindromic pair of hexameric half site (Thyroid hormone Response Element; TRE, Estrogen Response Element; ERE, Glucocorticoid Response Element; GRE) or directly repeated half sites [Direct Repeat (DR) 3, DR4, DR5]. In this report, these six elements and three additional putative elements, DRO, DR1, and DR2, which are directly repeated half sites separated by 0,1 and 2 nucleotides, respectively, were tested for binding to Ear3COUP-TF protein employing gel retardation method. Among the palindromic series of response elements, \{TRE\} showed the highest affinity, \{ERE\} showed second highest, and no binding was observed for GRE. Among six direct repeat response elements, \{DR1\} showed the highest affinity. Comparison of binding affinities between \{DR1\} and \{TRE\} revealed that the \{DR1\} has the highest affinity of all the nine response elements tested. The consensus sequence of the \{DR1\} element resembles well the \{COUP\} sequence found in the upstream promoter of chicken ovalbumin gene, which has been shown to serve as a natural response element for Ear3COUP-TF. Retinoid X receptor (RXR), another member of the receptor family, reportedly utilizes \{DR1\} sequence as its response element, suggesting that Ear3COUP-TF could regulate the expression of the same subsets of genes as \{RXR\} does.

This working hypothesis was examined in the present study by perfusing simultaneously the \{PAG\} and the amygdala after microinjection of morphine into the N. accumbens. It was found that microinjection of morphine increased the content of immunoreactive enkephalins (ir-ENK) and immunoreactive ÃŽÂ²-endorphin (ir-ÃŽÂ²-EP) in the perfusate of the \{PAG\} and the amygdala. When the perfusion fluid contained 3 ÃŽÂ¼M of naloxone, the increase of ir-ENK and ir-ÃŽÂ²-EP was reduced significantly.

Our results show that perturbation of fractal objects produces changes in geometry across many size scales. The location and size of the perturbation produces changes in the density distribution which are reflected in scaling and spectral measures. Characterizing the extent of change in terms of the multi-fractal spectrum and wavelength appear to be useful methods for relating the propagation properties associated with the perturbation to geometric changes present in the network.

Man is physically and informationally a continuously active system. Perception and consciousness, thinking and performance, learning and memory, knowledge and proficiency are psychological phenomena which operate in a thoroughly interactive way and which, in their fundamentals, constitute a truly dialectical system of physical structures and informational processes. The chapter examines a crucial problem in psychological modeling so that it qualitatively and quantitatively corresponds to the physiological basis of human information processing. The solution can be found through an interdisciplinary cooperation between neurophysiologists, cognitive psychologists, and artificial intelligence people. The organization of the human brain is based on a functional division into short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term memory. Sensory and motor buffer systems link this memory organization to its internal and external environments. The human brain is a dual processor of parallel image processing and sequential symbol processing. Physiological correlates of both image processing and symbol processing consist of short-term neuroelectrical and of intermediate-term and long-term biochemical structures and processes. "

Oxidation of propylene glycol was observed on Pd/C at both the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups to yield lactic acid, hydroxyacetone and pyruvic acid with low selectivities. Pd/C, which alone was inactive in the oxidation of lactic acid, bound Pb on the metallic Pd with a strong interaction. The resultant Pb/Pd/C revealed activity for the selective conversion of lactic acid into pyruvic acid. A trace amount of the additive Pb as low as the atomic ratio Pb/Pd = 0.05, was enough to afford pyruvic acid, and the initial rate of the oxidation showed a maximum at Pb/Pd=0.3. Similar catalysts gave results as follows: Pb/Pt/C, highly active, but less selective; Te/Pd/C, highly selective to pyruvic acid with mild activity; Bi/Pd/C, moderate in both activity and selectivity. Commercially available Pb/Pd/CaCO3 (Lindlar catalyst) and Pb/Pd/Al2O3 were also active, giving 60% yield of pyruvic acid. "

Nevertheless, little has been done to gasify this material because of various difficulties involved; such difficulties include high ash content and irregular geometry. Fluidized-bed gasification has been proposed as a useful method for biomass energy resource conversion. The gasification process is a heterogeneous reaction with a solid reactant which changes geometrically as conversion progresses. The use of a fluidized-bed reactor for rice-hull conversion has been proposed as well; however, it appears that the kinetics of the gasification process have not been studied extensively. In the present work, the development of the morphology of the rice-hull charcoal or char has been characterized by observing the changes in the surface areas, surface fractal dimensions and pore sizes at various temperatures of the devolatilization process in a fluidized-bed reactor. The results, which show the highly porous network of the microstructure, are relevant and applicable to the simulation of the reaction kinetics of rice-hull conversion. "

Immunization with the peptide elicited a considerably higher anti-peptide response in the \{C3HHe\} strain than in the \{C57BL6\} strain, despite the fact that the \{C57BL6\} T cells showed higher reactivity than the \{C3HHe\} T cells. The T cell and B cell determinants of the peptide were identified in these two strains. Each strain recognized a single B cell determinant and a single T cell determinant. In the \{C3HHe\} strain, the T and B cell determinants were located apart from one another, while the T and B cell determinants of the \{C57BL6\} strain were located in a region close each other. The results suggest that the level of an antibody response depends on the topological relationship of the T cell and B cell determinants on the antigen molecule. "

Fast proliferating tissues and tumors contain considerable amounts of free queuine and Q-deficient tRNAs. Here we show that HeLa cells can be grown in the absence or presence of queuine. In response to queuine, and under appropriate conditions, (i) the proliferation of HeLa cells was stimulated, (ii) the steady-state level of c-fos mRNA was reduced, contrary that of c-myc mRNA was elevated, and (iii) in cytosolic extracts protein phosphorylation especially for a 42 kDa protein was significantly increased. The results suggest that queuine substitutes for growth factors in a signal transduction pathway. "

abstract = {The problem of assessing the relevance of the reversibility of age-related functional alterations for aging studies has been presented. Transduction mechanisms of adrenergic stimulation have been chosen as the target of age-related changes and thymus as the effector of some corrective interventions performed at advanced age. Both alterations of adrenoceptor characteristics and their reversibility have been reviewed. ÃŽÂ²-adrenoceptors have been studied in organs bearing only one subtype of receptors or both, revealing an age-related decrease in density only in the ÃŽÂ²1-subtype. It has been shown that a similar age-related decrease is present in ÃŽÂ±1-adrenoceptor density. Such alterations are corrected by grafting a neonatal thymus into old mice. On the contrary, thymus fails to correct the alteration of T4-induced upregulation of ÃŽÂ²-adrenoceptors indicating some limits to its corrective effect when the net of functional interrelationships becomes relatively complex. Both failures and successes of thymic grafts and thymic extracts in reversing age-related changes are discussed taking into account the effects induced on the life span of the animals. Different unsolved problems stemming from the previous considerations are also presented. Among them the controversial question about linearity and non-linearity of biological parameters presumed to be good indices of aging is discussed, with the aid of a simple model as a schematic example.

Short duration (2Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3 s) bursts of radiation, as seen in the \{LE\} curves, accompanied the dissociation reactions. The light emission is highly dependent upon the ease with which electron transfer can occur between species in the redox process. Examination of structural information for these compounds indicates the presence of significant hydrogen bonds between oxidizing and reducing groups, which may facilitate this reaction by providing a convenient pathway for electron transfer.

abstract = {Rat Kupffer cells contain the three major cytoskeletal components: microfilaments (MF), microtubules (MT), and intermediate filaments (IF) of the vimentin type. Previous cytomagnetometric data obtained from alveolar macrophages and rat Kupffer cells in culture provided evidence that actin filaments contribute to the movements of lysosomes. The lysosomal transport in living cells was affected, when the \{MFs\} were selectively disturbed, whereas the depolymerization of the \{MTs\} had no effect on the lysosomal movement measured by cytomagnetometric means. Immunofluorescence and ultrastructural studies of isolated and cultured rat Kupffer cells, presented in this paper, will investigate the relationship between lysosomes and the cytoskeleton. The principal filamentous structure in the peripheral cytoplasm of Kupffer cells in a dense meshwork of actin filaments. The dimension of the meshes combined with the dimensions of lysosomes implies the necessity of either (i) disintegration of the actin filament cross-links, (ii) depolymerization and redistribution of MF's, or (iii) a displacement of actin filaments by the lysosomes during the organelle transport. The presence of microtubules in cytoplasmic protrusions and their track from the periphery to the perinuclear region during interphase might play a role in the transport mechanism of lysosomes, the more so because microtubules could often be demonstrated in closest association with lysosomes even in the first phase of endocytosis. The distribution pattern of vimentin, found as a dense interconnected framework surrounding the lysosomes like a basket, could play a role in positioning the organelles. The dynamic functions of MF's and MT's and their multifunctionality led to an adaptive and flexible organization of these filaments which may both be involved in lysosomal motion. Our morphological findings, although static in nature, led to the conclusion that all three major cytoskeletal components, microtubules, microfilaments, and the intermediate filament vimentin could participate in the complex interaction between lysosomes and the cytoskeleton, including the mechanism of lysosomal transcellular movements and the positioning of these organelles. The exact force-generating mechanism and the molecular basis involved in the organelle movements, however, remain obscure. "

Dissociation of embryonic tissue produced several cell types ot which muscle and neurone-like cells predominated. These cells were morphologically distinct once development had started in vitro with muscle cells often producing rhythmic contractions. Neurones had small cell bodies (&lt;10 ÃŽÂ¼m) and showed extensive outgrowth of neurites. Neuronal cell bodies readily sealed onto patch pipettes and with pipette solutions containing nicotinic agonists, single channel currents could be recorded. With cell-attached patches, these currents were inward at the cell resting potential and reversed with depolarization. Channels with two different conductances could be seen in the majority of patches. "

The materials, investigated under conditions comparable with optimal clinical conditions, showed values of residual monomer ranging from 6 to 43% for the different brands. The final properties of a dental composite restorative material are directly related both to the chemical composition of the monomer system and to the degree of conversion to polymer which has occurred in this monomeric component. The diametral tensile strength was decreased as the quantity of the residual monomer has increased and a simple linear relationship was obtained. "

It is now generally accepted that much of the interstellar gas is hydrogen molecule, and that the behavior of hydrogen molecule controls to a large extent the neutral component of the interstellar medium. Much of the data required for the interpretation of such observations has been calculated by Dalgarno and his collaborators in an extensive series of papers published over many years. The molecule is left in an excited vibrational level of the ground electronic state or in its vibrational continuum. Both the initial absorption and the subsequent emission are important processes in interstellar clouds. Dalgarno has examined the photo ionization of hydrogen molecule by hard radiation, the input of kinetic energy into the gas consequent upon the photo dissociation of hydrogen molecule, and absorption of radiation by vibrationally excited hydrogen molecule. This last process is now recognized as important in regions of intense irradiation where the relaxation time of excited vibrational levels is comparable to the mean absorption time. "

Morphologically, diimidoester (DMA or DMS)-fixed cells revealed a more complexed vimentin network than formaldehyde-fixed ones. In spite of this complexity, the clarity of individual filaments in DMA- or DMS-fixed cells was remarkable even in the most complex areas. Other evidence suggests that the buffer system of the diimidoester solutions plays a role in the clarity of the obtained immunofluorescent pictures. "

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter provides a biography of Aharon Katzir-Katchalsky, 1913-1972. It focuses on his contribution to the membrane field. Katchalsky's early work on membranes and transport phenomena in general was a natural outgrowth of his studies, covering more than a decade, of the chemical physics and biophysics of macromolecules. At the outset of his career, he was profoundly impressed by the notion that large polymeric molecules might play an essential role in all processes occurring in living systems as a consequence of, among other things, their conformational degrees of freedom. This was at a time when little was known of protein structure and \{DNA\} was still to be recognized as the carrier of genetic information. Undoubtedly, the contribution for which Katchalsky is chiefly known among workers in the membrane field is precisely his collaborative study of permeability with Kedem that led to the derivation of what they called Ã¢â‚¬Å“practicalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ phenomenological equations. These KedemÃ¢â‚¬â€œKatchalsky (or KÃ¢â‚¬â€œK) equations already possess a time-honored air. As Richardson has pointed out, it is little over a decade since the most complete versions of the equations were published, yet they have already taken their place alongside the Nernst-Planck and the Goldman equations as standard working models for physiologists and biophysicists.

The small-angle grain boundaries were facetted on the scale of about 100 Ãƒâ€¦. The twins were found to contain a large number of Shockley partials, most probably because lattice dislocations which are mobile at high temperatures are trapped by twin boundaries. Such Shockley partials in twin boundaries are recombination sites for minority carriers. Numerous precipitates were observed in the material, but because of the inhomogeneous distribution their concentration was difficult to determine. In energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), the precipitates were free of transition metals. Their \{TEM\} images showed classical Ashby-Brown contrast, indicating that they are centers of contraction or dilation. A new kind of microdefect, the micro-crack, which is not found in other ribbon material (EFG, Web) was found to occur in LASS. At present it appears likely that the cracks are created by a scraping action of the \{LASS\} ribbon over a sharp bend. "

As a means of overcoming the poor development of neural network models, this study describes and uses a systematic neural network development methodology. The methodology is presented via the study of a particular application of neural networksÃ¢â‚¬â€�determining the creditworthiness of commercial loan applications. The ability of humans to evaluate creditworthiness accurately is poor, and statistical techniques only help slightly. A neural network model is well suited for this type of problem. The results indicate that the proposed development methodology produced a neural network model that does a respectable job of determining creditworthiness in a very difficult problem situation. "

The platelet thrombus was induced in microvessels by irradiation of filtered light in combination with intravascular administration of fluorescent dye. The blood flow velocity began to increase soon after the initiation of thrombus formation and continued to increase progressively with the growth of the thrombus in the radial direction. After the velocity reached an almost constant level, the velocity fluctuation became significant due to the frequent detachment of platelet aggregates. Meanwhile, the blood flow velocity precipitously dropped. Two different definitions of a critical stenosis were proposed. The first definition was the condition that the blood flow velocity reached a maximum. The critical area stenosis based on this definition had almost a constant value, i.e., 75Ã¢â‚¬â€œ95% of the lumen area. The second definition of critical stenosis was given as the condition that the blood flow rate decreased by more than 15%. In the higher velocity range the values of critical stenosis based on the second definition were almost constant, i.e., 70Ã¢â‚¬â€œ90% of the lumen area. However, in the lower velocity range, the critical condition seemed to occur in smaller stenosis. "

This process leads to a non-linear algebraic system used to develop computer simulation programs. In this paper, the applications are based on the study of multiple-conveyor dryers. This type of dryer is used for many chemical engineering industrial applications to dry coarse particles (i.e., over 5 to 10mm) or for food engineering. Numerical simulations are performed to analyse the drying efficiency of these conveyor dryers. Due to the heat and mass numbers of transfer units and to the network idea, the computer programs run faster than classical ones. This program is involved in the expertise and study of the effectiveness ofmultiple-conveyor dryers. Some rules of behaviour of conveyor dryers are discussed and may be used in order to improve their design. "

Consideration is restricted to network oscillators containing no rhythm determining pacemaker neurons, and no neurons exhibiting self-limiting properties such as post-inhibitory rebound or accumulating refractoriness. In the state transition diagrams, stable oscillations are associated with a particular geometric configuration called a cyclic attractor (the heavy cycle in Fig. 2). We show that given the network connectivity it is possible to predict autonomous dynamic behaviour, as well as behaviour following hyperpolarizing or depolarizing inputs to neurons of the network. Conversely, given information about patterns of firing activity during cycles and transients of neural networks, the network connectivity can be predicted. The theoretical techniques can be used to generate a census of network structures capable of generating stable oscillations. Several representative network oscillators are discussed in the context of previous theoretical and experimental studies of the structure of neural network oscillators. Although the number of theoretically possible network oscillators capable of generating sustained oscillations is very large, the techniques which are given should be useful in the design of experiments capable of distinguishing between equally plausible hypotheses.

TNF-ÃŽÂ± activates endothelial cells, stimulates angiogenesis and induces proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Therefore, TNF-ÃŽÂ± has been suggested to be actively involved in the inflammatory events associated with atherosclerosis. Previous ultrastructural and immunocytochemical studies have shown that macrophages as well as \{SMCs\} are constituents of atherosclerotic lesions in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit. Recently, we have shown that TNF-ÃŽÂ± mRNA levels in aorta of 18-month-old \{WHHL\} rabbits were significantly higher than that of 6-month-old \{WHHL\} rabbits and New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits by quantitative RT-PCR [1]. However, it remains unclear as to the cell type(s) responsible for the increased TNF-ÃŽÂ± mRNA levels in atherosclerotic lesions. In this study, we provided evidence showing the expression of the TNF-ÃŽÂ± gene in the medial \{SMCs\} as well as cells of intimal lesions in arteries of \{WHHL\} rabbits by in situ transcription (IST). TNF-ÃŽÂ± protein was also detected in the cytoplasm of the intimal and medial \{SMCs\} and macrophages by immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against rabbit TNF-ÃŽÂ±. In contrast, the expression of TNF-ÃŽÂ± mRNA and protein can not be detected in the arteries from healthy New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Our results suggest that the expression of TNF-ÃŽÂ± in both intimal and medial \{SMCs\} and macrophages is associated with the progression of atherosclerosis. "

A modified algorithm for the heuristic search of optimal discrete (binary value) control sequences is presented. Feedback control is realized by solving the optimization problem for each control interval over a sufficiently long future time horizon (certainty equivalent open-loop feedback control). As a prerequisite, a state-space description of the network traffic dynamics is derived from a macroscopic model as used also in the simulation program METANET. Simulation results for route diversion on a hypothetical example network are given. The required computational effort is quantified and the control benefits are given in terms of network performance and the switching frequency of VMS. "

The structure of these vessels was not significantly different in hypertrophied and normal hearts. The capillaries showed great changes in the hypertrophied muscle: capillaries running on the body of the myofibres, in loop form on disorganized myofibres, and protruding into myofibres and/or probably penetrating through them.

Previous techniques to model and simulate heavy-duty hydraulic functions include using a combination of analytical, numerical and steady state solutions in a partitioned hierarchical manner [N. Sepehri, P. D. Lawrence and F. Sassani, Proc. \{IASTED\} Int. Conf. on Modeling and Simulation, pp. 170Ã¢â‚¬â€œ174 (1991)] or, a transmission line modeling approach to facilitate parallel processing [J. D. Burton, K. A. Edge and C. R. Burrows, \{ASME\} J. Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control 116, 137Ã¢â‚¬â€œ145 (1994)]. Using the results from the application of these methods to an excavator-based machine, databases are developed which are then used to construct polynomial abductive network models in order to replace the conventional iterative derivations for fluid flow distribution among the actuators. The networks are generated using a mechanism based on a hybrid learning logic called Ã¢â‚¬Å“abductory inductionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ [G. J. Montgomery and K. C. Drake, Proc. SPIEÃ¢â‚¬â€�Int. Soc. Optical Engng, pp. 56Ã¢â‚¬â€œ64 (1990)]. The performance of the polynomial abductive network model is compared to the previously established model. It is shown that the computation time is reduced considerably, yet the simulation results show a sufficient degree of predictive accuracy. Additionally, the new modeling scheme eliminates the need for explicit derivations of the main valve orifice areas, and therefore facilitates the use of experimental observations in developing simulation models.

abstract = {As the heart of any solid modelling system, much effort has been spent on formulating the data models which represent the shape of a polyhedral solid object within the computer in an accurate, unique and complete manner. Most of this effort has been devoted to make the models manipulateable in terms of computational efficiency, and preserve their semantic integrity. The price paid for achieving these goals is a proliferation of cross-reference data links which, coupled with multiple redundancy, renders the models inefficient for storage or transmission over communication channels. Moreover, the interrogation of these models by non-manipulative applications is usually unsupported functionally, requiring direct accesses to the data, which involves extensive pointer chasing and therefore high familiarity with the manipulative data structure. This paper presents an example relational model as a complementary logical scheme for viewing the shape database that facilitates compact storage and supports non-manipulative query operations through the projection, selection and join operators defined for the relational model, without requiring expert knowledge of the manipulative structure. The flexibility of the relational model, compared with that of the hierarchical, manipulative one, allows easy extensibility and the association of non-geometric attributes with each data item. "

While there have been considerable advances in optimization algorithms for solving distribution system design problems, they have not kept pace with the complexity of the problem facing managers. Consequently, non-optimizing methods such as scenario evaluation, which rely on human problem structuring and cognitive abilities, are frequently used to design distribution networks. This research experimentally examines the relationships between human problem solving performance and problem characteristics of typical distribution network design problems. In addition, associations between human attributes and problem solving performance are explored. The results of a laboratory study indicate that several problem characteristics affect analyst performance. Problem size is the dominant factor. Analysts' spatial reasoning abilities, education and experiences are also significantly associated with problem solving performance. Future research needs in this area are discussed. "

The representation can be used to predict traffic's evolution over time and space, including transient phenomena such as the building, propagation, and dissipation of queues. The easy-to-solve difference equations used to predict traffic's evolution are shown to be the discrete analog of the differential equations arising from a special case of the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. The proposed method automatically generates appropriate changes in density at locations where the hydrodynamic theory would call for a shockwave; i.e., a jump in density such as those typically seen at the end of every queue. The complex side calculations required by classical methods to keep track of shockwaves are thus eliminated. The paper also shows how the equations can mimic the real-life development of stop-and-go traffic within moving queues. "

Privatization within the bus industry is reviewed, with stress on the danger of high prices secured for some companies placing subsequent pressure on profits and the ability to finance investment. Criteria for investment appraisal in public transport infrastructure are examined, stressing the need for a more comprehensive approach. While not rejecting privatization, it is suggested that this process has not, in itself, improved ridership or revenue trends within the bus industry, and that many issues remain to be resolved in the rail sector.

In contrast, N-trinuoroacetyl-adriamycin-14-valerate (AD-32) was without effect in this system. Electron microscope studies of chromatin incubated with adriamycin, rubidazone and \{DHAQ\} showed that all of these drugs were capable of inducing the formation of highly condensed \{DNA\} structures. When chromatin was treated with 0.4 M NaCl, its ability to serve as a substrate for adriamycin-induced compaction was abolished. However, the salt-treated chromatin could still be condensed by \{DHAQ\} and rubidazone. The results of this study, therefore, show that a variety of closely related antitumor agents are capable of condensing isolated chromatin. However, certain of these compounds had distinct substrate requirements for the compaction reaction. "

Some examples are reported in which the activity of a tested chemical on nucleic acid metabolism could be detected only by taking into account the modification induced in the precursor pool. One example is the case of hexavalent chromium, which inhibits \{DNA\} and \{RNA\} syntheses, but also affects the uptake of exogenous nucleosides, thus modifying tha labelling pattern of nucleic acids in treated cells. A similar situation is observed with alkylating agents (e.g. \{MMS\} and EMS), whose induction of \{DNA\} repair synthesis is sometimes masked by the concomitant depletion of labelled nucleotides in the intracellular pool.

Nevertheless, these changes resulted from the interaction of storage and retrieval mechanisms with the age-related elaboration of the semantic memory system. This study shows that the memory improvement with age, between kindergarten and second grade, vanished when the meaningfulness of the materials were equated. The most plausible interpretation of the results is the hardware invariance hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, the memory apparatus for information processing is constant across ages, but the hardware is used more effectively if there is a better-developed semantic memory system.
