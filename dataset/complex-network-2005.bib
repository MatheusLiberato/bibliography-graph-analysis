abstract = {The influence of node–node degree correlations on distances in complex networks has been studied. We have found that even the presence of strong correlations in complex networks does not break a universal scaling of distances between vertices of such networks as science collaboration networks, biological networks, Internet Autonomous Systems and public transport systems. A mean distance between two nodes of degrees k i and k j in such networks equals to 〈 l ij 〉 = A - B log ( k i k j ) for a fixed value of the product k i k j . The scaling is valid over several decades. Parameters A and B depend on the mean value of a node degree 〈 k 〉 nn calculated for the nearest neighbors. We have found that extending our simple theory basing on a random branching tree by the first-order node degree correlations improves theoretical predictions for parameters A and B in assortative networks, while it fails in disassortative ones.}}

In this paper we formulate a model of geographic activity distribution with spatial correlations on the level of land lots where multiplicative growth is assumed to be dominant but not exclusive. The purpose is to retain the explanatory power of earlier models due to Simon, Gibrat and others while attaining some additional properties that are attractive for both empirical and modelling purposes. In this sense, the model presented here is a combination of the two factors that have been identified as central to urban evolution but rarely appear unified in the same model: transportation costs and multiplicative growth. The model is an elaboration of a previously reported complex network model of geographical land value evolution. We reproduce statistical properties of an empirical geographical distribution of land values on multiple hierarchical levels: land value per unit area, cluster areas, aggregated land value per cluster and cluster area/perimeter ratios. It is found that transportation effects are not strong enough to disturb the power law distribution of land values per unit area but strong enough to sort nodes to generate a new set of power laws on a higher level of aggregation. The main hypothesis is that all these relations can be understood as consequences of an underlying growing scale-free network of geographic economic interdependencies.}}

It was found that in addition to the reduction of the effective transmission rate, through the screening of infectives, spatial correlations have another major effect through the enhancement of stochastic fluctuations, which may become considerably larger than in the homogeneously mixed stochastic model. As a consequence, in finite spatially structured populations significant differences from the solutions of deterministic models are to be expected, since sizes even larger than those found for homogeneously mixed stochastic models are required for the effects of fluctuations to be negligible. Furthermore, time series of the (unforced) model provide patterns of recurrent epidemics with slightly irregular periods and realistic amplitudes, suggesting that stochastic models together with complex networks of contacts may be sufficient to describe the long-term dynamics of some diseases. The spatial effects were analysed quantitatively by modelling measles and pertussis, using a susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered (SEIR) model. Both the period and the spatial coherence of the epidemic peaks of pertussis are well described by the unforced model for realistic values of the parameters.}}

This evidence, along with the advances in the theory of complex networks, has triggered an intense research activity aimed at exploiting the evolutionary and biological significance of the resulting network's topology. Here we present a review of the results obtained in the characterization and modeling of the yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae protein interaction networks obtained with different experimental techniques. We provide a comparative assessment of the topological properties and discuss possible biases in interaction networks obtained with different techniques. We report on dynamical models based on duplication mechanisms that cast the protein interaction networks in the family of dynamically growing complex networks.

A newly added vertex chooses one of the modules composed of existing vertices, and attaches edges to vertices belonging to that module following the \{PA\} rule. When the module size reaches a proper size, the module is divided into two, and a new module is created. The karate club network studied by Zachary is a simple version of the current model. We find that the model can reproduce both modular and hierarchical properties, characterized by the hierarchical clustering function of a vertex with degree k, C ( k ) , being in good agreement with empirical measurements for real-world networks.}}

Since the method detects efficiently clustered nodes in large networks even when these are not sharply partitioned, it turns to be specially suitable for the analysis of social and information networks. We test the algorithm on a large-scale data-set from a psychological experiment of word association. In this case, it proves to be successful both in clustering words, and in uncovering mental association patterns.}}

Connected groups of metadislocations can assume large and complex network structures with large total Burgers vectors. However, the local elastic strain at the individual metadislocation cores as well as the fault-plane energies remain small. By this mechanism, effective large Burgers vectors, contributing massively to plastic strain, can be distributed over a large portion of the material.}}

When navigation with an enlarged information horizon is applied the waiting time distribution on structured networks has a power-law tail which can be parametrized by 1 / ( 1 - q ) , where the respective value of the non-extensivity parameter q increases systematically with increasing graph complexity. The corresponding distribution on the small-world graph appears to be a stretched-exponential function that cannot be classified within the same scheme. We further demonstrate by looking at the anti-persistence in flow time-series and the transit time distributions, how traffic efficiency increases with an extended information horizon. A horizon of two layers approaches the critical horizon on the correlated cyclic scale-free graph, suggesting that the mechanisms of signaling over two-to-three layers ensure efficient transport processes on networks with this organizational complexity.}}

Specifically, instead of using a random graph topology, we deal with a complex heterogeneous network characterized by a power-law degree distribution coupled to a continuous dynamics for each network's component. The dynamics of the model is very rich and stationary, periodic and chaotic states are observed upon variation of the model's parameters. We characterize these states numerically and report on several quantities such as the system's phase diagram and size distributions of clusters of stationary, periodic and chaotic nodes. The results are discussed in view of recent debate about the ubiquity of complex networks in nature and on the basis of several biological processes that can be well described by the dynamics studied.}}

There is little selective advantage for one hypercycle to maintain coexistence with others. This brings the possibility of the outcompetition between hypercycles resulting in the negative effect on information diversity. To enrich the information in hypercycles, symbiosis with parasites is suggested. It is shown that symbiosis with parasites can play an important role in the prebiotic immunology.}}

abstract = {Recently several authors have proposed stochastic evolutionary models for the growth of complex networks that give rise to power-law distributions. These models are based on the notion of preferential attachment leading to the “rich get richer” phenomenon. Despite the generality of the proposed stochastic models, there are still some unexplained phenomena, which may arise due to the limited size of networks such as protein and e-mail networks. Such networks may in fact exhibit an exponential cutoff in the power-law scaling, although this cutoff may only be observable in the tail of the distribution for extremely large networks. We propose a modification of the basic stochastic evolutionary model, so that after a node is chosen preferentially, say according to the number of its inlinks, there is a small probability that this node will be discarded. We show that as a result of this modification, by viewing the stochastic process in terms of an urn transfer model, we obtain a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff. Unlike many other models, the current model can capture instances where the exponent of the distribution is less than or equal to two. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the consistency of our model by analysing a yeast protein interaction network, the distribution of which is known to follow a power law with an exponential cutoff.}}

Patterns and processes resulting from interactions between individuals, populations, species and communities in landscapes are the core topic of ecology. These interactions form complex networks, which are the subject of intense research in complexity theory, informatics and statistical mechanics. This research has shown that complex natural networks often share common structures such as loops, trees and clusters. The observed structures contribute to widespread processes including feedback, non-linear dynamics, criticality and self-organisation. Simulation modelling is a key tool in studying complex networks and has become popular in ecology, especially in adaptive management. Important techniques include cellular automata and individual-based models. The complex systems paradigm has led to advances in landscape ecology, including a deeper understanding of the dynamics of spatial pattern formation, habitat fragmentation, epidemic processes, and genetic variation. Network analysis reveals that underlying patterns of interactions, such as small worlds and clusters, in food webs and ecosystems have strong implications for their stability and dynamics. These investigations illustrate how complexity theory and associated methodologies are transforming ecological research, providing new perspectives on old questions as well as raising many new ones.}}

This hub mediates many protein interactions with a wide range of affinities (KD ranging from &gt;10−3 M to &lt;10−7 M). Furthermore, many of these interactions are evolutionally conserved and functionally indispensable for maintaining the integrity of and signaling through the integrin–actin network. Consequently, loss of the PINCH-1–ILK complex is disastrous for embryogenesis in vertebrates and invertebrates. By contrast, aberrance of individual interactions contributes to diverse defects. Dissecting the interactions and functions that are mediated by the PINCH-1–ILK complex presents an exciting challenge and an opportunity to unravel the structure and functions of the integrin–actin network.}}

Along with topological variations, we study the pattern formation capacities of regular, random, small-world and scale-free graphs. Pattern formation capacity is quantified in terms of two entropy measures, which for standard cellular automata allow a qualitative distinction between the four Wolfram classes. A mean-field model explains the dynamic behavior of random graphs. Implications for our understanding of information transport through complex, network-based systems are discussed.}}

In these models, in addition to the intra-node dynamics, which corresponds to an individual-based population dynamics of species, the entire network itself changes slowly with time to capture evolutionary processes. After a brief summary of our recent published works on these network models of eco-systems, we extend the most recent version of the model incorporating predators that wander into neighbouring spatial patches for food.}}

We show that the capacity and performance of these networks can be enormously enhanced by judicious manipulation of connectivity properties. We discuss the relevance of these results to the general context of information spread processes on networks.}}

Although design methods have been proposed for creating, ab initio, a network that has optimal robustness according to a given measure, one is often instead faced with an existing network that cannot feasibly be substantially modified or redesigned, yet whose robustness can be improved by a lesser degree of modification. We present empirical results that show how robustness, as measured either by the size of the largest connected component or by the shortest path length between pairs of nodes, is affected by several different strategies that alter the network by rewiring a fraction of the edges or by adding new edges. We find that a modest alteration of an initially ‘scale-free’ network can usefully improve robustness against attack, particularly when the fraction of attacked nodes is small, and we identify modification schemes that are most effective for this purpose.}}

The focus is to show the way this task can be achieved through high-level ab initio quantum chemical computations and ad hoc optimization tools, using either real or model (that is, simplified) systems. Another purpose of the chapter is to show that, nowadays, a computational chemist can adapt his/her “instruments” (the method, approach, and level of accuracy) to the problem under investigation, as every other scientist does when there is a problem to study and a methodology to be chosen. In particular, different and often complementary computational tools may be used. The chapter describes extensive use of a combined ab initio CASPT2(10,11)//CASSCF(12–15) methodology as it has been proven to reproduce data with nearly experimental accuracy. The operational procedure for approaching a photochemical problem are then described and discussed. The applications of such a procedure to the intriguing problems of determining the mechanism of the photoinduced cis-trans isomerization of a retinal protonated Schiff base (RPSBs) model and of azobenzene (Ab) are discussed. The complex network of reaction paths underlying the photochemical reactivity of cyclooctatetraene is discussed to illustrate both general and subtle aspects of photochemical organic reaction mechanisms.}}

The study of the landforms in arid regions that are tectonically stable and without significant anthropic activity, reflect that many of the existing landscapes have been generated under geomorphologic conditions that differ from the current ones. Therefore, those landforms are considered as paleoforms or inherited landforms, originating under morphoclimatic conditions different from the present ones. For instance, the extensive dune fields of the Sahelian zone, covered by grassland vegetation indicate a higher aridity during the time of formation. Similarly, no water currently flows in the complex network of ouads (wadis) in the central Sahara, indicating periods of higher precipitation in the past. These landscapes show significant modifications to the distribution of the arid regions over the surface of the planet. From this evidence came the concept of the pluvial period or lacustrine phase that can be defined as that in which hydrological and biogeographic conditions were more humid than present conditions. Further, tropical climates include a wide variety of precipitation regimes and vegetation associations, from selva to savanna and the transitions to semiarid zones. The most significant studies on climate change in the humid tropics have been carried out based on the analysis of superficial deposits, found clear evidence of stages of aridity in the Pleistocene period.}}

By means of analytical and numerical results, we show that the outbreak time evolution follows a precise hierarchical dynamics. Once reached the most highly connected hubs, the infection pervades the network in a progressive cascade across smaller degree classes. Finally, we show the influence of the initial conditions and the relevance of statistical results in single case studies concerning heterogeneous networks. The emerging theoretical framework appears of general interest in view of the recently observed abundance of natural networks with complex topological features and might provide useful insights for the development of adaptive strategies aimed at epidemic containment.}}

Hybrid systems, originally developed for process control applications, provide advances in modelling such systems. A particular class of hybrid systems which are relatively simpler to analyze mathematically but still capable of demonstrating the essential features of many non-linear dynamical systems is piecewise-linear systems. Implementation of piecewise-linear systems for modelling of regulatory dynamical systems requires different considerations depending on the status of the problem. In this work we considered three different cases. Firstly, we consider the inferential modelling problem based on the empirical observations and study the discrete piecewise-linear system, whose inverse problem is solvable under some assumptions. Secondly, we considered the problem of obtaining some complex regulatory systems by tractable piecewise-linear formulations and study the qualitative dynamic features of the systems and their piecewise-linear models. Finally, we considered Boolean delay equations for building abstract models of regulatory systems, which might be the simplest models demonstrating the essential qualitative features of our interest underlying adaption, learning and memorization.}}

In this review, we discuss several distinct features of these neurons and the mechanisms by which they regulate cortical development. Many \{CR\} cells likely have extracortical origin and undergo cell death during development. Recent genetic studies report unique patterns of gene expression in \{CR\} cells, which may help to explain the developmental processes in which they participate. Moreover, a number of studies indicate that \{CR\} cells, and their secreted gene product, reelin, are involved in neuronal migration by acting on two key partners, migrating neurons and radial glial cells. Emerging data show that these neurons are a critical part of an early and complex network of neural activity in layer I, supporting the notion that \{CR\} cells modulate cortical maturation. Given these key and complex developmental properties, it is therefore conceivable for \{CR\} cells to be implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurological disorders.}}

In the proposed scheme a novel, multi-dimensional, unsupervised clustering method is used to properly initialize neural network architectures, focusing on resource allocating networks (RAN); both the hidden and output layer parameters are determined by the output of the clustering process, without the need for any user interference. The main contribution of this work is that the proposed approach leads to network structures that are compact, efficient and achieve best classification results, without the need for manual selection of suitable initial network parameters. The efficiency of the proposed method has been tested on several classes of publicly available data, such as iris, Wisconsin and ionosphere data.}}

Firstly, there are some nodes of the floating type that show intermittent behavior between getting attached to some clusters and evolving independently. Secondly, we identify two different ways of cluster formation, namely self-organized clusters which have mostly intra-cluster couplings and driven clusters which have mostly inter-cluster couplings.}}

With the number of outgoing links following a power-law distribution, the results are similar to the undirected case. As the accelerated growth is enhanced, the degree of distribution becomes independent of the “initial attractiveness”, a parameter which plays a key role in directed networks. As an example of a directed model with accelerated growth, the citation network is considered, in which the distribution of the number of outgoing link has an exponential tail. The role of accelerated growth is examined here with two different growth laws.}}

One of the principal arguments against this observation is that it is valid only for random networks, and therefore does not apply to real-world networks, which presumably are structured. Here, we examine how the introduction of small-world topological structure into networks affects their stability. Our results indicate that, in structured networks, the parameter values at which the stability–instability transition occurs with increasing complexity is identical to that predicted by the May–Wigner criteria. However, the nature of the transition, as measured by the finite-size scaling exponent, appears to change as the network topology transforms from regular to random, with the small-world regime as the cross-over region. This behavior is related to the localization of the largest eigenvalues along the real axis in the eigenvalue plain with increasing regularity in the network.}}

We calculate the variances around the mean protein levels in the steady states of Type-1 and Type-4 coherent \{FFLs\} using a stochastic model of gene expression and the Langevin formalism. The Type-1 \{FFL\} is found to be less noisy than the Type-4 FFL. Type-1 \{FFL\} motif is more abundant than Type-4 \{FFL\} motif in GTRNs.

An empirical analysis of three different real markets reveals that the distributions of both k in and v display power-law tails with exponents γ and α . Moreover, we find that k in scales as a power-law function of v with an exponent β . Remarkably, despite the values of α , β and γ differ across the three markets, they are always governed by the scaling relation β = ( 1 - α ) / ( 1 - γ ) . We show that these empirical findings can be reproduced by a recent model relating the emergence of scale-free networks to an underlying Paretian distribution of ‘hidden’ vertex properties.}}

abstract = {Several studies on real complex networks from different fields as biology, economy, or sociology have shown that the degree of nodes (number of edges connected to each node) follows a scale-free power-law distribution like P ( k ) ≈ k - γ , where P ( k ) denotes the frequency of the nodes that are connected to k other nodes. Here we have carried out a study on scale-free networks, where a line graph transformation (i.e., edges in an initial network are transformed into nodes) is applied on a power-law distribution. Our results indicate that a power-law distribution as P ( k ) ≈ k - γ + 1 is found for the transformed network together with a peak for low-degree nodes. In the present work, we show a parametrization of this behaviour and discuss its application on real networks as metabolic networks, protein–protein interaction network and World Wide Web.}}

Since triiodothyronine (T3) stimulates lipid metabolism, \{UCP3\} expression and mitochondrial uncoupling, we examined its effects on some biochemical pathways that may underlie UCP3-mediated uncoupling. T3-treated rats (Hyper) showed increased mitochondrial lipid-oxidation rates, increased expression and activity of enzymes involved in lipid handling and increased mitochondrial superoxide production and CoQ levels. Despite the higher mitochondrial superoxide production in Hyper, euthyroid and hyperthyroid mitochondria showed no differences in proton-conductance when \{FA\} were chelated by bovine serum albumin. However, mitochondria from Hyper showed a palmitoyl–carnitine-induced and GDP-inhibited increased proton-conductance in the presence of carboxyatractylate. We suggest that \{T3\} stimulates the \{UCP3\} activity in vivo by affecting the complex network of biochemical pathways underlying the \{UCP3\} activation.}}

Within enterocytes and hepatocytes, these exogenous or endogenous, potentially toxic compounds may be metabolized by phase I cytochrome \{P450\} (CYP) and phase \{II\} conjugating enzymes. Many transporter proteins and metabolizing enzymes are subject to direct translational modification, enabling very rapid changes in their activity. However, to achieve intermediate and longer term changes in transport and enzyme activities, the genes encoding drug and bile acid transporters, as well as the \{CYP\} and conjugating enzymes, are regulated by a complex network of transcriptional cascades. These are typically mediated by specific members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, particularly FXR, SHP, PXR, CAR, and HNF‐4α. Most nuclear receptors are activated by specific ligands, including numerous xenobiotics (PXR, CAR) and bile acids (FXR). The fine‐tuning of transcriptional control of drug and bile acid homeostasis depends on regulated interactions of specific nuclear receptors with their target genes.}}

During the period known as the ‘window of implantation’, the endometrium expresses specialized proteins, many of which exhibit potential use as markers of endometrial receptivity. Trophoblast differentiation to the invasive phenotype also depends on the up-regulation of certain peptides and the down-regulation of others. Disruption of each pathway is theoretically possible, and studies in animal models suggest that implantation defects result when the function of these proteins is blocked. Indeed, the implantation process is currently considered the most important limiting factor for the establishment of viable pregnancy. The present overview of the literature reports critical families of molecules located at the embryo–maternal interface and describes the mechanisms of interplay and control. Since these factors are crucial to the process of implantation, targeting them might be a valuable contraceptive tool. Conversely, induction of specific peptides may prove to be beneficial in certain infertility cases.}}

abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of cartilage and bone. The destructive lesions result from both immune responses and non-antigen-specific inflammatory processes. Little is known about the primary cause of RA. Although the primacy of T-cell-related events early in the disease remains debated, strong evidence indicates that autoantigen recognition by specific T cells is crucial to the pathophysiology of rheumatoid synovitis. We will discuss evolving concepts about T-cell involvement in \{RA\} and the roles for various T cell subsets in the development of joint abnormalities. The hypothesis that \{RA\} is a T-cell driven disease was put forward when studies of \{RA\} synovium showed numerous T cells carrying activation markers. These T cells were found to participate in the complex network of cell- and mediator-driven events leading to joint destruction. Conceivably, these T cells may be stimulated by an autoantigen (whether specific to the joints or ubiquitous), a highly conserved foreign protein cross-reacting with its human homolog, or a neo-antigen expressed as a result of posttranslational events. For many years, animal models have provided valuable evidence supporting a role for T cells in RA. We will review three murine models of arthritis caused by different mechanisms. In collagen-induced arthritis, the immune response to a joint antigen is mediated by pathogenic Th1 cells that elicit severe inflammatory synovitis. Spontaneous arthritis in K/BxN T-cell-receptor transgenic mice is related to an adaptive immune response against a ubiquitous protein whose end-stage effector mechanisms are heavily dependent on the innate immune system. In the \{SKG\} model of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis, a point mutation in the gene encoding a key signal-transduction molecule in T cells causes defective T cell selection in the thymus, which releases polyclonal autoreactive T cells. Studies in these and other animal models have established that a variety of T-cell subsets whose roles vary with cell location and disease stage can contribute to synovitis. Finally, in addition to direct autoimmune attack by effector T cells, arthritis may result from defective homeostatic control of immunity by regulatory T cells.}}

This article reports that MTF-1 plays a central role in hypoxic cells by contributing to HIF-1 activity. Loss of MTF-1 in transformed Mtf1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) results in an attenuation of nuclear HIF-1α protein accumulation, HIF-1 transcriptional activity, and expression of an established HIF-1 target gene, glucose transporter-1 (Glut1). Mtf1 null (Mtf1 KO) \{MEFs\} also have constitutively higher levels of both glutathione (GSH) and the rate-limiting enzyme involved in \{GSH\} synthesis—glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit—than wild type cells. The altered cellular redox state arising from increased \{GSH\} may perturb oxygen-sensing mechanisms in hypoxic Mtf1 \{KO\} cells and decrease the accumulation of HIF-1α protein. Together, these novel findings define a role for MTF-1 in the regulation of HIF-1 activity.}}

The dykes were sourced from a clast-poor sandy diamicton, interpreted as a subglacial till, and were intruded downwards beneath Sólheimajökull glacier during a previous phase of advance. As the glacier advanced southwards, it loaded the sediment column resulting in the intrusion of dykes with a consistent south–southwest dip (with rare northward-dipping examples). The dyke fills are characterised by laminated sediment, with laminae oriented parallel to the dyke margins and comprise interlaminated clay, silty clay, silt, sand, sandy gravel and diamicton. In some dykes, high concentrations of pebble- to boulder-sized clasts occur in association with rotated pods of the laminated sediment. The laminae are thought to have evolved by a slow, long-lived intrusion process that involved the repeated fracture and expansion of the host sediments followed by viscous smearing-on of subglacial material onto the dyke walls, rather than rapid injection of fluidised sediment.}}

These include the effects of different habitats on the phenotypic traits of the organisms, the effects of different mutation rates on adaptation, fitness, and diversity, and competition between generalists and specialists. The model exhibits a wide variety of microevolutionary and macroevolutionary phenomena which can arise in organisms which are subject to random mutation, and selection based on fitness evaluated in a specific environment. Generalists arise in uniform habitats, where different disturbances occur with equal frequency, while specialists arise when the relative frequency of different disturbances is skewed. Fast mutators are seen to play a primary role in adaptation, while slow mutators preserve well-adapted configurations. When uniform and skewed habitats are coupled through migration of the organisms, we observe a primitive form of punctuated equilibrium. Rare events in the skewed habitat lead to extinction of the specialists, whereupon generalists invade from the uniform habitat, adapt to their new surroundings, ultimately leading their progeny to become vulnerable to extinction in a subsequent rare disturbance.}}

This essay focuses on the last two-decade studies on chimerism in the cosmopolitan urochordate Botryllus schlosseri, enlightening and focusing the idea of multichimeras as a primary tool for fending off the pervasiveness of super parasitic germ lines. Interacting Botryllus colonies may fuse or reject each other based on allelic compatibility on a single highly polymorphic gene locus. After fusion and establishment of a chimera, a second tier of allorecognition is developed, expressed as genetically controlled morphological resorption of one of the chimeric partners. This is followed by the third tier of allorecognition where somatic and germ cell lineages parasitism are developed. Studies revealed a complex network of costs and few suggested benefits for the state of chimerism in botryllid ascidians. Two life history traits (diversification of allorecognition allele repertoire, colonial programmed lifespan) were considered as selected to combat the major cost of chimeric associated germ cell parasitism. Three other ecological traits (heterosis, settlement of kin larvae in aggregates, multichimerism) have been suggested as selected to enhance the existence of chimerism in botryllid ascidians. Recent results revealing a fine-tuning of the chimerical somatic genetic components in response to changes in environmental conditions are discussed. Results further elucidate the possible existence of multichimeras, each made of several genotypes. It is proposed that natural multichimeras form more stable and vigorous entities, depicting a unique way for domesticating consortia of selfish cells that may otherwise seriously threaten survivorship of the entity.}}

The anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) reduces theta frequency when injected into the medial supramammillary nucleus (mSuM), posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PH) and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH). These hypothalamic effects on theta could underlie at least some behavioural effects of benzodiazepines. We have previously shown that in a fixed interval 60-s schedule (FI60), \{CDP\} injected into mSuM reduced both theta frequency and behavioural inhibition. The present experiments test the effect of injections into \{PH\} and \{DMH\} on theta and hippocampal-sensitive behaviour (FI60 and open field ambulation). Systemic \{CDP\} (5 mg/kg i.p.) released, but PH/CDP (20 μg in 0.5 μl vehicle) suppressed \{FI\} responding, though they both reduced \{FI\} theta frequency. In the open field, both \{CDP\} i.p. and PH/CDP reduced ambulation, but only the systemic injection reduced ambulation theta frequency. Taken together with previous research, these results support a role for \{PH\} in the control of voluntary behaviour. They imply that this function may be suppressed, independently of theta, by benzodiazepines. An anxiolytic effect of PH/CDP in \{FI60\} may, therefore, have been masked by a concurrent action of \{CDP\} on the \{PH\} motor system. DMH/CDP did not affect behaviour or theta in either experiment, despite the fact that this nucleus is involved in benzodiazepine mediation of risk assessment and the flight response. This suggests that, like the control of theta frequency by the hypothalamus, the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety are distributed in complex networks.}}

Potential benefits include extended life, early warning of deterioration and failure, greater availability and an improved match to the vehicle's requirements. The impact of electronics in other areas shows that there is considerable potential to go much further in this direction with battery systems. There are, however, important system-wide issues to be considered. The battery system must conform to a wide range of standards and practices applicable to automotive electronic systems and embedded software. The automotive industry is itself trying to come to terms with the inherent difficulties involved in developing, qualifying and upgrading complex networks of software-based controllers within the vehicle.

Consequently, a variety of different models have been developed with different choices of state variables, process formulations, and different degree of physical control. In the last decade a multitude of studies were based on biogeochemical models, population models, and individual based models. There are now models available that cover the full range from individual based models, to population models, to biomass models, to combinations thereof. The biological model components are linked to physical models ranging from 1d water column models to full 3d general circulation models. This paper attempts to develop an unifying theoretical framework that elucidates the relationships among the different classes of models. The theory is based on state densities, which characterize individuals in an abstract phase space. Integration of the state densities over spatial or biological variables relates population densities, abundance or biomass to individuals.}}

abstract = {A conventional view of the role of sarcomeric thin filaments in cardiac function is that they react with cross-bridges that translate them toward the center of the sarcomere in a reaction triggered by Ca2+ and powered by ATP. However, thin filaments also engage in a complex network of protein–protein interactions in the Z-disc. Thus, in the modern context, understanding of what thin filaments do in the heart must take into account not only A-band regions that react with cross-bridges, but also I-Z-I regions that rarely, if ever, react with cross-bridges and dwell near and within the Z-disc. To highlight these multiplex functions of the thin filament, I discuss the hypothesis that physical and chemical reactions at the interface of the thin filaments with Z-disc proteins control the docking and activity of kinases and phosphatases that control the levels of phosphorylation of thin filament regulatory proteins. Testing this hypothesis has taken on new significance with the identification of multisite phosphorylation of thin filament proteins as a critical element in the control of cardiac contraction and relaxation reserve and in maladaptive mechanisms in heart failure. Moreover, multiple mutations in Z-disc proteins that link to prevalent cardiomyopathies are likely to alter this remote control of A-band thin filament function.}}

Remodelling involves a complex network of cell–cell signalling involving systemic hormones, locally produced cytokines, growth factors and the mechanical environment of the cells. Here, we report on the effect of mechanically-induced strain on the synthesis by mouse calvarial osteoblasts in monolayer culture of IL-10 and IL-12, two cytokines that inhibit osteoclast formation in bone marrow cultures; IL-10 also suppresses osteoblast differentiation suggesting a role for both cytokines in bone physiology. A tensile strain was applied to the cells intermittently for 6 s, every 90 s, for 2–96 h. After 2-h culture, supernatants from deformed cells contained significantly less IL-10 than control cultures. In contrast, mechanical deformation had a stimulatory effect on IL-12 synthesis; however, by 48 h both had returned to control levels. These data suggest that IL-10 and IL-12 can be added to the growing list of mechanical stress-responsive genes. The down-regulation of IL-10 and stimulation of IL-12 further suggests that the initial response of the cells to mechanical deformation was an osteogenic one.}}

The rate of discoveries about the mechanisms leading to chromosomal instability in cancer cells is increasing rapidly. Although these mechanisms were thought to be unrelated, they are intimately intertwined, connecting the complex network of cellular pathways. Since chromosomal instability is undoubtedly a major cause of tumor evasion of therapy, understanding the mechanisms leading to chromosomal instability has major translational significance.}}

The linear flow processes considered include both symmetric and biassed flow, e.g. of single `particles', or `currents' related linearly to `density', and for these we exploit existing techniques to deal with background geometry and disorder. The nonlinear/collective flow considered is `driven' flow of vehicles and other excluding `particles' as it is captured by a biased hard core hopping model. This stochastic nonequilibrium process has been much studied in the one-dimensional case, where it provides the simplest example of a nonequilibrium phase transition. Recent work has given some insights into the typically severe effects of disorder in such collective models, mainly in one dimension. Correspondingly, striking effects are expected for such processes on structured networks, but so far little has been published, even for the pure case. The paper uses linear flow to provide a basic introduction to the subject, then briefly discusses disorder effects before moving on to nonlinear flow on pure structured networks, including the Cayley tree, and finally comments on the combined effects of structure and disorder.}}

To investigate the performance of the network, we construct a model following that of Hopfield, whose energy function possesses both Hebbian spin glass and anti-ferromagnetic terms. With the assistance of the replica method, we find that the memory state of the network decreases enormously due to the effect of the anti-ferromagnetic order induced by the inhibitory connections.

Sequencing of the 18S rRNA portion of cloned F-ARISA products revealed the presence of four distinct fungal genera including Backusella sp., Mucoraceae, Geotrichum sp. and the yeast Pichia sp. Based on the presence and absence of these \{ARISA\} operational taxonomic units (A-OTUs), we observed a shift in fungal community structure between 48 and 60 h. This change in community structure preceded a rise in pH and coincided with an increase in temperature. Clone libraries constructed using fungi-specific 18S rRNA primers contained sequences similar to several other fungal genera including Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Hamigera sp., Neurospora sp. and the yeast Candida sp. While the fungal species richness was relatively low at any time point, the community structure was dynamic and paralleled changes in bacterial community structure.}}

The ATP‐dependent transmembrane transporter P‐glycoprotein (Pgp) confers long‐term cell survival in the presence of different toxins, including anticancer drugs (this concept is referred to as multidrug resistance, or MDR). The vital importance of this mechanism for cell survival dictates the reliability and promptness of its acquisition. To fulfill this requirement, the \{MDR1\} gene that encodes Pgp in humans must be readily upregulated in cells that express low to null levels of \{MDR1\} mRNA prior to stress. The \{MDR1\} gene and a stable \{MDR\} phenotype can be induced after short‐term exposure of cells to a variety of cues. This effect is implemented by activation of \{MDR1\} transcription and mRNA stabilization. The \{MDR1\} message abundance is regulated by mechanisms generally involved in stress response, namely activation of phospholipase C, protein kinase C and mitogen‐activated protein kinase cascades, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and nuclear factor kappa B activation. Furthermore, the proximal \{MDR1\} promoter sites critical for induction are not unique for the \{MDR1\} gene; they are common regulatory elements in eukaryotic promoters. Moreover, \{MDR1\} induction can result from activation of (an) intermediate gene(s) whose product(s), in turn, directly activate(s) the \{MDR1\} promoter and/or cause(s) mRNA stabilization. Redundancy of signal transduction and transcriptional mechanisms is the basis for the virtually ubiquitous inducibility of the \{MDR1\} gene. Thus, the complex network of \{MDR1\} regulation ensures rapid emergence of pleiotropic resistance in cells.}}

A true understanding of sucrose accumulation will be achieved only through a combination of experimental and computational analyses of comprehensive datasets to gain information on the underlying molecules and processes. Currently, systems-level approaches towards understanding biology are gaining momentum primarily because of the tremendous increases in computing power, advances in information sciences and rapid progress being made in molecular biology to facilitate data management, analyses and modeling from high-throughput genome sequencing and proteomics. Large-scale sequencing projects have not only provided complete sequence information for a number of genomes, but they are also producing integrated pathway-genome databases and models that provide organism-specific connectivity maps of metabolic and, to a lesser extent, other cellular networks. To date, the processes that generate mass, energy, information transfer and cell-fate specification have been analyzed only at the cell or microorganism levels, where they are shown to be seamlessly integrated through a complex network of cellular constituents and reactions. Despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Fifty years of sugarcane research have identified and characterized a suite of physiological processes and enzymes involved in sucrose accumulation. More recently, genes encoding these enzymes have been isolated, cloned and used in experiments to transform sugarcane to increase or decrease expression of the enzyme with the goal of altering sucrose accumulation. However, results of this reductionist approach towards understanding sucrose accumulation have fallen short of expectations, apparently because of the complex interactions among the multitude of simultaneous processes. Recent rapid expansion of sugarcane molecular datasets and the beginning of a systems approach to metabolic modeling of sucrose accumulation point the way for future research efforts to integrate processes from gene to crop performance.}}

By using calvarial osteoblasts, we showed that IL-1β increased IL-6 production time- and concentration-dependently, and that these effects were potentiated by VIP. Furthermore, IL-1β stimulated IL-6 promoter activity in the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 stably transfected with a human IL-6 promoter/luciferase construct, and both VIP, and the related neuropeptide PACAP-38, increased the effect of IL-1β in a synergistic manner. The IL-6 protein release from calvarial osteoblasts was also stimulated by the osteoclastogenic, proinflammatory cytokines IL-11, LIF, OSM, IL-17, TGF-β, and TNF-α. All effects, except for that of TNF-α, were synergistically potentiated by VIP. These findings further support the role of neuropeptides, and the presence of neuro-immunological interactions, in bone metabolism.}}

We quantitatively and qualitatively compare our results with previously published work on cellular automata and show that randomly interconnected automata are computationally more efficient in solving these two global tasks. Our approach also provides convergence and quality estimates and allows the networks to be randomly rewired during operation, without affecting the global performance.

Comparing the \{MIA\} with a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a panel of spiked plasma samples resulted in correlation coefficients for all mediators between \{R2\} = 0.88 and \{R2\} = 0.99. Intra-assay variance was less than 10% whereas inter-assay variance ranged between 6% and 16%. Pathological samples with heterophilic antibodies hamper immunoassays such as \{ELISA\} and MIA.

One of the largest riverine wetlands in the world is the floodplain (várzea) of the Amazon River and its tributaries (Junk and Piedade, 1997). The central Amazon wetlands are constituted by a complex network of lakes and floodplains, named várzeas, that extend over more than 300,000 km2 (Junk, W.J., The Amazon floodplain- a sink or source for organic carbon? In Transport of Carbon and Minerals in Major World Rivers,edited by E.T. Degens, S. Kempe, R. Herrera, SCOPE/UNEP; 267–283, 1985.) and are among the most productive ecosystems in the world due to the regular enrichment in nutrients by river waters In order to understand if the adjacent floodplain of Amazon River have a significant influence on the trace element concentrations and fluxes of the mainstem, the concentrations of selected elements (i.e., Al, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Mo, Rb, Sr, Ba, and U) have been measured in the Amazon River water (Manacapuru Station, Amazonas State, Brazil) and in lake waters and plants (leaves) from a várzea (Ilha de Marchantaria, Amazonas State, Brazil) during different periods of the hydrological cycle. Four plant species (two perennial species: Pseudobombax munguba and Salix humboldtiana, and two annual herbaceous plants: Echinochloa polystachya and Eichhornia crassipes) were selected to represent the ecological functioning of the site. Time series obtained for dissolved Mn and Cu (&lt;0.20 μm) in Amazon River water could not be explained by tributary mixing or instream processes only. Therefore, the contribution of the waters transiting the floodplains should be considered. These results suggest that the chemical composition of the waters draining these floodplains is controlled by reactions occurring at sediment–water and plant–water interfaces. Trace elements concentrations in the plants (leaves) vary strongly with hydrological seasonality. Based on the concentration data and the biological productivity of floodplain ecosystems, a first order approximation of trace element storage (permanent or temporary) in the vegetation of these floodplains was made. It was found that floodplain-mainstem elemental fluxes make a significant contribution to the dissolved flux of the Amazon River.

The deposits, formed towards the end of the orogenic evolution, represent the economic products of two distinct mineralizing systems, a Au ± Sb hydrothermal system and a W ± Sn and rare-metals magmatic–hydrothermal system, which were simultaneously active during a short time span between ca. 310 and 300 Ma. Two types of gold deposit can be distinguished on the basis of their depth of emplacement: “deep-seated” gold deposits developed under lithostatic to hydrostatic pressure during rapid exhumation, and “shallow” gold deposits emplaced under hydrostatic pressure with no significant uplift. Deposits of W ± Sn and rare-metals were emplaced in the upper crust during final crystallization of specialized magmas after their rapid ascent, perhaps enhanced by simultaneous regional uplift. The gold-bearing systems are associated with a complex network of re-activated crustal-scale faults initially active during the period between 335 and 315 Ma. Normal motion along the faults, coeval with 335 to 315 Ma granite–migmatite domes, played a major role in the 3D distribution of the hydrothermal plumbing system. Gold and related metals were carried within huge hydrothermal cells, which reached ca. 100 km by 10 km in area, and 30 km in depth. In contrast, granites rich in magmatophile elements (W, Sn, rare-metals) generated smaller hydrothermal cells (10 km by 10 km in area, and &lt; 6 km deep). Extraction of metals, by both deep-seated fluids and specialized magmas, occurred during granulitization of the lower crust at 300 ± 15 Ma. In the French Massif Central, the genesis of the two late Carboniferous mineralizing systems coincided with the end of syn-collisional extension and ended just before post-collisional extension.}}

abstract = {Drugs and bile acids are taken up into hepatocytes by specialized transport proteins localized at the basolateral membrane, e.g., organic anion transporting polypeptides . Following intracellular metabolism by cytochrome \{P450\} (CYP) enzymes, drug metabolites are excreted into bile or urine via ATP-dependent multidrug resistance proteins (MDR1 and MRPs). Bile acids are excreted mainly via the bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11). The genes coding for drug and bile acid transporters and \{CYP\} enzymes are regulated by a complex network of transcriptional cascades, notably by the ligand-activated nuclear receptors FXR, PXR, and \{CAR\} and by the ligand-independent nuclear receptor HNF-4α. The bile acid synthesizing enzymes CYP7A1, CYP8B1, and \{CYP27A1\} are subject to negative feedback regulation by bile acids, which is partly mediated through the transcriptional repressor SHP. The role of transcriptional cofactors, such as SRC-1 and PGC-1, in mediating the gene-specific effects of individual nuclear receptors is becoming increasingly evident.}}

Increasing impacts from human activities, coupled with those from natural disasters, have set off its current poor state. Here, I critically overview the salient features for Eilat's reef degradation published since the 1960s. Although this reef is one of the most intensively studied small coral reef worldwide, the literature elucidates that the available results are exceedingly fragmented, offering only scanty knowledge for the causes and pathways of the reef deterioration. During the years, 1975–2000, scarcely any reef evaluation had been done and the reef at Eilat was not well characterized to establish baseline data for future evaluations and for analyzing the trends. Even the follow up studies on the extreme low tide episode (occurred during 1970) are limited and localized, and cannot be used as a model case in calibrating Eilat reef status. Natural forces affecting the reef at Eilat are understood only vaguely, and coral assemblages/recruitments, even between neighboring sites, vary markedly in any studied biological-ecological parameter. The importance of the complex networks of interactions between algae, their grazers and corals for structuring coral assemblages, were overlooked, and massive algal growths were mistakenly attributed to anthropogenic impacts alone. Whereas, no long-term study can provide much indication for future prospects, at present, the tourist industry is probably the major cause for reef decline. Surprisingly, the literature further unveils at some sites various ecological properties, such as species diversity and densities of coral species and colonies, similarly to the values recorded decades ago and reveals that the paucity of information has led to conclusions unsubstantiated by robust sets of experiments. At this stage, therefore, decisive conclusions pertaining to the causes and pathways of Eilat reef degradation cannot be reached. Four future prospectuses are outlined, including the need for implementation of active restoration measures.}}

Using a pathway-focused oligonucleotide \{DNA\} microarray, we found a possible association between chemokine genes regulating Th1/Th2 balance and genes regulating T-cell proliferation during HHV-6B infection. Gene network analysis using an integrated comprehensive workbench, VoyaGene, revealed that a gene encoding a TEC-family kinase, ITK, might be a putative modulator in the host immune response against HHV-6B infection. We conclude that Th2-dominated inflammatory reaction in host cells may play an important role in HHV-6B-infected T cells, thereby suggesting the possibility that \{ITK\} might be a therapeutic target in diseases related to dysregulation of Th1/Th2 balance. This study describes a novel approach to find genes related with the complex host–virus interaction using microarray data employing the Bayesian statistical framework.}}

In addition, we measured in a subgroup of these patients in the same individual orexin-A and leptin plasma levels one year after gastric banding surgery. Methods Basal plasma values were determined in obese patients (BMI = 48 ± 1 kg/m2 n = 32) after an overnight fast and compared to healthy, normal weighted (BMI = 22 ± 2 kg/m2 n = 12) controls. In addition, blood samples were collected in a subgroup of patients (BMI = 48 ± 1 kg/m2 n = 8) the day before surgery and 1 year after the operation. Apelin, orexin-A, and leptin levels were analysed using ELISAs. Results One year after the operation obese patients significantly lost weight (from 48 ± 2 kg/m2 to 39 ± 2 kg/m2; p &lt; 0,001).

No difference between pre- and post-operative orexin-A levels was observed, while leptin plasma levels significantly decreased from 45.1 ± 5.4 ng/ml to 27.3 ± 6.0 ng/ml (p = 0.015). Conclusions Apelin, orexin-A, and leptin plasma levels correlated positively with the BMI.

Melanoblast culture requires medium supplemented with a range of growth factors including Stem Cell Factor, Endothelin-3 and Fibroblast Growth Factor-2, withdrawal of which causes the cells to differentiate into melanocytes. Using the human melanoblast culture system, we have now examined the expression and/or \{DNA\} binding activity of several transcription factors implicated in melanocytic development and differentiation. Of these, the \{POU\} domain factor \{BRN2\} and the \{SOX\} family member \{SOX10\} are both highly expressed in unpigmented melanocyte precursors but are down-regulated upon differentiation. In contrast, the expression levels of the previously described \{MITF\} and \{PAX3\} transcription factors remain relatively constant during the melanoblast–melanocyte transition. Moreover, \{BRN2\} ablated melanoma cells lack expression of \{SOX10\} and \{MITF\} but retain PAX3. A novel finding implicates a second \{SOX\} protein, SOX9, as a potential melanogenic transcriptional regulator, as its expression level is increased following the down-regulation of \{BRN2\} and \{SOX10\} in differentiated melanoblasts. Our results suggest that a complex network of transcription factor interactions requiring proper temporal coordination is necessary for acquisition and maintenance of the melanocytic phenotype.}}

Among the glycosaminoglycans, heparin binds reversibly with many proteins, therefore, poly(ethylene glycol) based biomaterials, normally resistant to cell adhesion, functionalized with heparin in order to sequester important proteins, can actively and selectively stimulate desired cell functions. Results demonstrate that methacrylate-modified heparin retained its ability to bind heparin-binding proteins both in solution and when copolymerized with dimethacrylated \{PEG\} in a hydrogel.

Within this complexity, the p53–Mdm2 negative auto-regulatory loop serves as a major route through which intra- and extra-cellular stress signals are channeled to appropriate p53 responses. Mdm2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activities and through its \{E3\} ligase activity promotes p53 proteasomal degradation either within the nucleus or following nuclear export. Upon exposure to stress signals these actions of Mdm2 have to be moderated, or even interrupted, in order to allow sufficient p53 to accumulate in an active form. Multiple mechanisms involving a variety of factors have been demonstrated to mediate this interruption. C-Abl is a critical factor that under physiological conditions is required for the maximal and efficient accumulation of active p53 in response to \{DNA\} damage. C-Abl protects p53 by antagonizing the inhibitory effect of Mdm2, an action that requires a direct interplay between c-Abl and Mdm2. In addition, c-Abl protects p53 from other inhibitors of p53, such as the HPV-E6/E6AP complex, that inhibits and degrades p53 in HPV-infected cells. Surprisingly, the oncogenic form of c-Abl, the Bcr-Abl fusion protein in \{CML\} cells, also promotes the accumulation of wt p53. However, in contrast to the activation of p53 by c-Abl, its oncogenic form, Bcr-Abl, counteracts the growth inhibitory activities of p53 by modulating the p53–Mdm2 loop. Thus, it appears that by modulating the p53–Mdm2 loop, c-Abl and its oncogenic forms critically determine the type and extent of the cellular response to \{DNA\} damage.}}

To examine the effect of the loss of MCP-1 on expression of the chemokine network, we compared the mRNA expression profiles of MCP-1−/− and wild type mice during the acute inflammatory phase of excisional wounds. Utilizing a mouse cDNA array containing 514 chemokine and chemokine related genes, the loss of MCP-1 was observed to cause a significant upregulation of nine genes (Decorin, Persephin, IL-1β, MIP-2, MSP, IL1ra, CCR5, CCR3, IL-11) and significant downregulation of two genes (CCR4 and CD3Z) in acute wounds. The array data was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The effect of MCP-1 deletion on chemokine expression was further examined in isolated macrophages. Compared to wild type, LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from MCP-1−/− mice showed a significant increase in the expression of RANTES, MIP-1β, MIP-1α and MIP-2 mRNA. The data suggest that loss of a single chemokine perturbs the chemokine network not only in the setting of acute inflammation but even in an isolated inflammatory cell, the macrophage.}}

abstract = {Background &amp; Aims: Liver regeneration is a unique response directed to restore liver mass after resection or injury. The survival and proliferative signals triggered during this process are conveyed by a complex network of cytokines and growth factors acting in an orderly manner. Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor is thought to play an important role in liver regeneration. Amphiregulin is a member of the epidermal growth factor family whose expression is not detectable in healthy liver. We have investigated the expression of amphiregulin in liver injury and its role during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Methods: Amphiregulin gene expression was examined in healthy and cirrhotic human and rat liver, in rodent liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, and in primary hepatocytes. The proliferative effects and intracellular signaling of amphiregulin were studied in isolated hepatocytes. The in vivo role of amphiregulin in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy was analyzed in amphiregulin-null mice. Results: Amphiregulin gene expression is detected in chronically injured human and rat liver and is rapidly induced after partial hepatectomy in rodents. Amphiregulin expression is induced in isolated hepatocytes by interleukin 1β and prostaglandin E2, but not by hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin 6, or tumor necrosis factor α. We show that amphiregulin behaves as a primary mitogen for isolated hepatocytes, acting through the epidermal growth factor receptor. Finally, amphiregulin-null mice display impaired proliferative responses after partial liver resection. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that amphiregulin is an early-response growth factor that may contribute to the initial phases of liver regeneration.}}

abstract = {Abstract: The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine system which is vital for the organism to meet and adapt to stressful challenges and physical demands. A complex network of stimulatory and inhibitory influences from neural and endocrine origin governs the activity of the \{HPA\} axis. The regulatory setpoints (e.g. responsiveness to secretagogues, negative-feedback sensitivity, limbic and frontal cortical inhibitory and stimulatory control) within this network are not static but, on the contrary, are dynamically adjustable in response to changes in environmental conditions such as stressful events. Thus, the \{HPA\} axis does not only respond to stressful events by an acute surge in glucocorticoid hormone production, but also by adjusting its regulatory setpoints in order to adapt to the altering conditions. In recent work on voluntarily exercising mice, we obtained new insights into the regulatory control mechanisms of the \{HPA\} axis. Voluntary exercise is established by providing mice with a running wheel in their home cage. They run exuberantly (~ 7 km/day), mainly during the first half of the dark phase. Voluntary exercise has been shown to act beneficially on the organism (either animal or human) precipitating effects at the cellular, system and behavioural level. Here, we account of the “lessons” we learned from studying the \{HPA\} axis in this animal model. We found that the \{HPA\} axis of control mice is asymmetric at least at the level of the adrenal gland (i.e. the left adrenal is larger than the right one) and, possibly, at the level of the central nervous system as well. Moreover, this asymmetry is most likely associated with the asymmetry in the sympathoadrenomedullary system. Strikingly, in exercised mice, this asymmetry was abolished due to a selective potentiation of the right sympathoadrenomedullary branch and growth of the right adrenal gland. The impact of these effects of long-term voluntary exercise on regulatory components of the \{HPA\} axis and its responsiveness to different types of stressors is reviewed and discussed.}}

abstract = {Real-time media distribution over the Internet poses several challenging problems due to its stringent delay/loss requirements and complex network dynamics. A promising approach to alleviate the severe impacts of these dynamics is to transmit the media over diverse paths. For such an environment, multiple description (MD) coding has been previously proposed to produce multiple independently decodable streams that are routed over partially link–disjoint (non-shared) paths for combatting bursty packet losses and error propagation. However, selecting these paths appropriately is fundamental to the success of \{MD\} streaming and path diversity. Hence, in this paper we develop models for \{MD\} streaming over multiple paths and based on these models we propose a multi-path selection method that chooses a set of paths maximizing the overall quality at the client under various constraints. The simulation results with MPEG-2 show that sizeable average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements (ranging from 0.73 to 6.07 dB) can be achieved when the source video is streamed over intelligently selected multiple paths as opposed to over the shortest path or maximally link–disjoint paths. In addition to the \{PSNR\} improvement, end-users experience a more continual, i.e., uninterrupted, streaming quality. Our work also considers the architecture and mechanisms by which multi-path streaming can be accomplished over a conventional \{IP\} network.}}

In the present contribution we consider the winner relaxing approach for the neural gas network. Originally, winner relaxing learning is a slight modification of the self-organizing map learning rule that allows for adjustment of the magnification behavior by an a priori chosen control parameter. We transfer this approach to the neural gas algorithm. The magnification exponent can be calculated analytically for arbitrary dimension from a continuum theory, and the entropy of the resulting map is studied numerically confirming the theoretical prediction. The influence of a diagonal term, which can be added without impacting the magnification, is studied numerically. This approach to maps of maximal mutual information is interesting for applications as the winner relaxing term only adds computational cost of same order and is easy to implement. In particular, it is not necessary to estimate the generally unknown data probability density as in other magnification control approaches.}}

Several studies, including some from our own group, suggest that important quantitative and functional alterations are present in the stroma of patients with myelodysplasia (MDS). However, in most of such studies the stroma has been analyzed as a complex network of different cell types and molecules, thus it has been difficult to identify and characterize the cell(s) type(s) that is (are) altered in MDS. In the present study, we have focused on the biological characterization of \{MSC\} from MDS. As a first approach, we have quantified their numbers in bone marrow, and have worked on their phenotypic (morphology and immunophenotype) and cytogenetic properties. \{MSC\} were obtained by a negative selection procedure and cultured in a \{MSC\} liquid culture medium. In terms of morphology, as well as the expression of certain cell markers, no differences were observed between \{MSC\} from \{MDS\} patients and those derived from normal marrow. In both cases, \{MSC\} expressed CD29, CD90, \{CD105\} and Prolyl-4-hydroxylase; in contrast, they did not express CD14, CD34, CD68, or alkaline phosphatase. Interestingly, in five out of nine \{MDS\} patients, \{MSC\} developed in culture showed cytogenetic abnormalities, usually involving the loss of chromosomal material. All those five cases also showed cytogenetic abnormalities in their hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, in some cases there was a complete lack of overlap between the karyotypes of hematopoietic cells and MSC. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first in which a pure population of \{MSC\} from \{MDS\} patients is analyzed in terms of their whole karyotype and demonstrates that in a significant proportion of patients, \{MSC\} are cytogenetically abnormal. Although the reason of this is still unclear, such alterations may have an impact on the physiology of these cells. Further studies are needed to assess the functional integrity of MDS-derived MSC.}}

Upon infection, the sequential release of exogenous agents (e.g. bacterial and viral products) and induction of endogenous mediators (e.g. cytokines and chemokines) contribute to the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to the inflamed tissue. Microbial products trigger multiple cell types to release cytokines, which in turn are potent inducers of chemokines. Primary cytokines act as endogenous activators of the immune response, whereas inducible chemokines act as secondary mediators to attract leukocytes. Interaction between exogenous and endogenous mediators thus enhances the inflammatory response. In this review, the synergistic interaction between cytokines to induce chemokine production and the molecular mechanisms of the cooperation amongst co-induced chemokines to further increase leukocyte recruitment to the site of inflammation are discussed.}}

This has had a concomitant impact on the choice of appropriate model formulations for given flood-forecasting applications. Whilst weather radar used in combination with raingauges – and extended to utilise satellite remote-sensing and numerical weather prediction models – have offered the prospect of progress, there have been significant problems to be overcome. These problems have curtailed the development and adoption of more complete distributed model formulations that aim to increase forecast accuracy. Advanced systems for weather radar display and processing, and for flood forecast construction, are now available to ease the task of implementation. Applications requiring complex networks of models to make forecasts at many locations can be undertaken without new code development and be readily revised to take account of changing requirements. These systems make use of forecast-updating procedures that assimilate data from telemetry networks to improve flood forecast performance, at the same time coping with the possibility of data loss. Flood forecasting systems that integrate rainfall monitoring and forecasting with flood forecasting and warning are now operational in many areas. Present practice in flood modelling and forecast updating is outlined from a \{UK\} perspective. Challenges for improvement are identified, particularly against a background of greater access to spatial datasets on terrain, soils, geology, land-cover, and weather variables. Representing the effective runoff production and translation processes operating at a given grid or catchment scale may prove key to improved flood simulation, and robust application to ungauged basins through physics-based linkages with these spatial datasets. The need to embrace uncertainty in flood-warning decision-making is seen as a major challenge for the future. To cite this article: R.J. Moore et al., C. R. Geoscience 337 (2005).}}

Rational drug design became possible in the 1950s when theoretical knowledge of drug–target interaction and experimental drug testing could interlock in cycles of mutual advancement. The integration does not, however, diminish the importance of basic research for pharmaceutical development. Rather, it can be shown that still in the 1990s, linear processes of innovation and the close combination of practical and epistemic work were interdependent.}}

Three major meiotic processes – chromosome pairing, synapsis and recombination – are involved in the formation of bivalents. Many recent reports have uncovered complex networks of interactions between these processes. Chromosome pairing is largely dependent on the initiation and progression of recombination in fungi, mammals and plants, but not in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila. Synapsis and recombination are also tightly linked. Understanding the coordination between chromosome pairing, synapsis and recombination lends insight into many poorly explained aspects of meiosis, such as the nature of chromosome homology recognition.}}

As peers get in and out of the system, the information content made available by the prevailing membership varies continually in amount as well as composition, which in turn affects all peers’ join/leave decisions. As a result, the dynamics of membership and information content are strongly coupled, suggesting interesting issues about growth, sustenance, and stability. In this paper, we propose to study such communities with a simple statistical model of an information sharing club. Carrying their private payloads of information goods as potential supply to the club, peers join or leave on the basis of whether the information they demand is currently available. Information goods are chunked and typed, as in a file-sharing system where peers contribute different files, or a forum where messages are grouped by topics or threads. Peers’ demand and supply are then characterized by statistical distributions over the type domain. This model reveals interesting critical behaviour with multiple equilibria. A sharp growth threshold is derived: the club may grow towards a sustainable equilibrium only if the value of an control parameter is above the threshold, or shrink to emptiness otherwise. The control parameter is composite and comprises the peer population size, the level of their contributed supply, the club’s efficiency in information search, the spread of supply and demand over the type domain, as well as the goodness of match between them.}}

Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis.

Many works on the organisational dimension in safety are now available and some recent researches have attempted to integrate the three dimensions, sometimes in a quantitative manner. This paper is an attempt to make things clearer around the organisational issues for the purpose of enhancing current safety auditing but also for discussing the issue of integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches with various dimensions. This paper goes through a presentation of complexity and the work of some researchers who have conceptually defined complexity. This provides an interesting framework compared to the scientific deterministic and positivist one (generally implied in technical approaches), when it comes to thinking of complex systems, which organisations and major accidents phenomena are. This paper tries to identify some of the most influential organisation theories within the human and social sciences and attempts to classify some of the existing organisational researches in major hazard prevention and accident investigation using these theories. With an experience in technical risk assessment, safety auditing and accident investigation, the author discusses the difficulty of introducing the complex nature of organisations into integrated methodologies (implying a link between technical installations and organisations), and discusses the perspective of introducing it into current safety auditing practices. The research strategy of this work is therefore an interdisciplinary one, using insights from safety engineering, safety auditing practices and human and social sciences. This kind of research implies an exploration and understanding of the rationales in these different domains. It is aimed at creating, as far as possible, articulation between them for practical purposes. The nature of this paper is therefore in some parts theoretical and conceptual, but intends to frame some of the issues for improving auditing techniques and integrated methodologies. Current empirical researches are being carried out to create the methodologies required for supporting auditing improvements.}}

However, most control schemes assume that users will behave in a cooperative way, without taking care of guaranteeing that they will not act in a selfish manner. Then, a fundamental issue is to evaluate the impact of cheating. From the point of view of game theory, a Nash equilibrium implies that nobody can take advantage by unilaterally deviating from this stable state, even in the presence of selfish users. In this paper we prove that any efficient Nash equilibrium strongly depends on the number of users, if the control scheme policy does not record their previous behavior. Since this is a common pattern in real situations, this implies that the system would be always out of equilibrium. Consequently, this result proves that, in practice, oblivious control schemes must be improved to cope with selfish users.}}

The links are established each time two syllables form part of the same word. We use two different data sets to perform the numerics: a Portuguese dictionary and the complete work of the most important Brazilian writer—Machado de Assis. The syllabic network shows a low distance and a high clustering coefficient when compared with an associated Erdos–Renyi graph and with an associated random network with the same distribution of connectivity. The distribution of connectivity of the syllabic network follows a power law with exponent γ ≃ 1.4 indicating complex behavior.}}

In this paper, a conceptual definition of flexibility which suits infrastructure design has been proposed. By means of the identification of the interactions between an infrastructure and its surroundings and of the systemic uncertainties, taxonomy, a systems engineering framework for the design of flexible infrastructures has been proposed. To test the application effectivness and utility of the proposed framework, it has been qualitively applied in the conceptual synthesis of an infrastructure (gas pipeline network) design problem.}}

After each sectioning a radiographic dorsoplantar view of the forefoot was obtained and radiologic parameters were determined. No significant change of values was seen in the hallux valgus angle, the proximal articular set angle and the intermetatarsal angle 1/5. However, a progressive increase of the intermetatarsal angle was determined during sequential sectioning of the fascia (p=0.56). The increase of the \{IM\} angle for a static test indicates a stronger stabilizing effect on the plantar plate of the first two rays compared to the lateral forefoot. However, the overall effect of the plantar fascial release on the structure of the forefoot is not significant.}}

The characteristics of thus formed networks are explored using two approaches: computer simulations of network growth and a theoretical description based on a master equation. The results of the two approaches are in excellent agreement. Special emphasis is put on the investigation of the node degree probability distribution. It is found that the tail of the distribution has the exponential form given by exp ( - k / m ) . Implications of the node degree distribution with such tail characteristics are briefly discussed.}}

We found that the optimal network shows a scale-free property for large degree k when the buffer-size distribution has a power-law form and the probability with which a node is chosen as a destination of a packet is proportional to the buffer size of the node.}}

However, recent research shows that abscisic acid can also be implicated in increasing the resistance of plants towards pathogens via its positive effect on callose deposition.}}

Important network behaviors can be obtained from the potential function without explicitly solving for the time-dependent solution. The existence of such a potential function suggests a global optimization principle. The existence stochastic force corresponds naturally to the hierarchical structure in metabolic networks. We provide theoretical evidences to justify our proposal by discussing its connections to others large-scale biochemical systems approaches, such as the network thermodynamics theory, biochemical systems theory, metabolic control analysis, and flux balance analysis. Experimental data displaying stochasticity which carries important biological information are also pointed out.}}

In addition, \{CCL3\} null mice exhibited milder clinical and histopathological scores following administration of anti-CII mAb and endotoxin. Moreover, the release of \{TNF\} in response to systemic administration of endotoxin was not affected in \{CCL3\} null mice compared to wild-type mice, indicating that the phenotype was not attributable to a defect in endotoxin response.

Administration of these bivalent scFvs significantly prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with \{KPMM2\} human myeloma cells. Because bivalent scFvs induced neither \{ADCC\} nor CDC, such antitumor activity by bivalent scFv is presumably attributable to cell death caused by the ligation of CD47.

In this report, we describe a patient who developed a recurrent nonscarring blistering eruption, affecting both skin and mucous membranes. Immunoblotting of dermal extracts and extracellular matrix of cultured keratinocytes revealed circulating autoantibodies directed to the p200 antigen and the α3 chain of laminin 5, respectively.

We study the distribution of the cluster-degree, which is size dependent but the tail is kept invariant for different degree exponents in the \{GBA\} model. In addition, for the degree dependence of the clustering coefficient, very different behaviors arise for different cases of the \{GBA\} model. The physical sense of the invariance property of cluster-degree is explained and more general cases are discussed. All the above theoretical results are verified by simulation.}}

In this study, we examined the role of peritubular capillary (PTC) injury in the development of CAN. Methods We studied renal biopsies (n = 79) obtained from grafts with CAN. \{PTC\} injury was examined morphologically by immunohistochemistry for CD34. These findings were correlated with interstitial fibrosis and graft dysfunction. Humoral immunity involved in \{CAN\} was studied by \{C4d\} staining. Results The \{CAN\} cases in the present study included chronic rejection (CR) (n = 14, 17.8%) and C4d-positive chronic humoral rejection (CHR; n = 6, 42.9% in \{CR\} cases). Irrespective of CR, CHR, or other CAN, the development of \{CAN\} was characterized by injury to and loss of identifiable PTCs, accompanied with the development of interstitial fibrosis. In \{CR\} and \{CHR\} cases, the loss of \{PTCs\} was prominent and seemed to progress within a relatively short period after transplantation. A decrease in the number of \{PTCs\} significantly correlated with the development of interstitial fibrosis (r = −0.75, P &lt; .001) and impairment of graft function (r = −0.69, P &lt; .001). Conclusions Irrespective of whether CR, CHR, or other factors contribute to CAN, the processes involved in its development appear similar and are characterized by progressive injury and loss of PTCs, with the development of renal scarring. Immunohistochemistry for \{CD34\} in human renal biopsies is a useful method for the detection of microvascular injury.}}

Three prediction models can be achieved, i.e., model for von Mises stress at wafer center, model for maximum von Mises stress and model for nonuniformity on wafer surface under various combinations of process parameters. The data of von Mises stress and nonuniformity on wafer surface can be first achieved under different conditions of the carrier load, pad's elastic modulus and thickness by using the developed finite element model for CMP. Next, an abductive network was applied to synthesize the data sets from the \{FE\} simulation. It is a self-organizing adaptive modeling tool that establishes the mathematical relationship between input and output variables based on abductive modeling technique and it can automatically synthesize the optimal network structure, including the optimal network structure, the number of layers and the form of functional nodes. Finally, the results from the three developed abductive networks with test data are compared with those from \{FE\} simulation to confirm the feasibility of this approach. The findings verified that the results confirm the feasibility and the proposed prediction models for \{CMP\} are acceptable.}}

While intuition might suggest that the reactions with larger fluxes are more likely to be lethal under the blockade of its catalysing gene products or gene knockouts, we find, by in silico flux analysis, that the lethality rarely has correlations with the flux level owing to the widespread backup pathways innate in the genome-wide metabolism of Escherichia coli. Lethal reactions, of which the deletion generates cascading failure of following reactions up to the biomass reaction, are identified in terms of the Boolean network scheme as well as the flux balance analysis. The avalanche size of a reaction, defined as the number of subsequently blocked reactions after its removal, turns out to be a useful measure of lethality. As a means to elucidate phenotypic robustness to a single deletion, we investigate synthetic lethality in reaction level, where simultaneous deletion of a pair of nonlethal reactions leads to the failure of the biomass reaction. Synthetic lethals identified via flux balance and Boolean scheme are consistently shown to act in parallel pathways, working in such a way that the backup machinery is compromised.}}

The cumulative wealth distribution function has an exponential behavior in the low and medium wealth limit, and shows the Pareto-like power-law tail for the upper 5% of the society. The obtained Pareto indexes are in good agreement with the measured ones. The generated family networks also converge to a statistically stable topology with a simple Poissonian degree distribution. On this family network many interesting correlations are studied, and the main factors leading to wealth diversification and the formation of the Pareto law are identified.}}

However, in contrast to a large growing number of well-characterized, strong PPIs, the weak PPIs, especially those with \{KD\} &gt; 10−4 M, are poorly explored. Genome wide, there exist few 3D structures of weak \{PPIs\} with \{KD\} &gt; 10−4 M, and none with \{KD\} &gt; 10−3 M. Here, we report the \{NMR\} structure of an extremely weak focal adhesion complex (KD∼3 × 10−3 M) between Nck-2 \{SH3\} domain and PINCH-1 \{LIM4\} domain. The structure exhibits a remarkably small and polar interface with distinct binding modes for both \{SH3\} and \{LIM\} domains. Such an interface suggests a transient Nck-2/PINCH-1 association process that may trigger rapid focal adhesion turnover during integrin signaling. Genetic rescue experiments demonstrate that this interface is indeed involved in mediating cell shape change and migration. Together, the data provide a molecular basis for an ultraweak \{PPI\} in regulating focal adhesion dynamics during integrin signaling.}}

A 40-year-old man visited our hospital for the purpose of colorectal screening due to a positive faecal occult blood test. A pedunculated and reddish polyp was found endoscopically in the ascending colon. The polyp was large but was resected endoscopically without any problems. Histologically, the abnormal tissue of the polyp was located in the submucosal and mucosal layer. Proliferation of spindle cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as plasma cells and eosinophils, were observed. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were positive for CD34, which was localised in the cytoplasm. These cells were also positive for \{S100\} protein but were negative for c-kit and muscle markers. These findings are compatible with the histological diagnosis of inflammatory fibroid polyp. The surgical margin of the polyp was free of the tumour. Inflammatory fibroid polyp is more commonly found in the stomach or small intestine, and rarely in the colon, and therefore our case is a rare example of large and pedunculated colonic inflammatory fibroid polyp, which was treated successfully by endoscopic polypectomy.}}

Compared with uninfected controls, an altered cytokine and chemokine production by \{BM\} cells has been observed before treatment, characterised by decreased IL-2 and elevated TNF-α, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and \{RANTES\} levels, along with a defective \{BM\} clonogenic activity. Antiretroviral therapy determined an amelioration of stem cell activity, a restoration of stromal cell pattern and functions, and an increased IL-2 production at \{BM\} level and a decrease of Fas expression on progenitor cells, in parallel with the diminution of TNF-α levels. HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) may improve hematopoietic functions owing to their direct effects on the \{BM\} progenitor cells.

abstract = {A microbroth chemiluminometric version of the biochemical induction assay (BIA) was developed using a chemiluminescent substrate widely used to detect β-galactosidase in high-throughput screening (HTS) laboratories. The assay was run in both 96-well and 384-well plate formats using the Zymark RapidPlate® liquid handling system to transfer samples and reagents. Chemiluminescence was read using the Victor-2 multilabel counter. The new microbroth chemiluminometric method, the CBIA, allowed rapid screening of samples, crude extracts, and pure compounds for their DNA-damaging effects in bacteria. In screening a small subset of our natural products library samples by the agar plate \{BIA\} and the CBIA, the latter yielded a higher hit rate, suggesting it is more sensitive than the agar plate assay. The \{CBIA\} was unaffected by the colored samples often encountered during screening of crude natural products extracts.}}

Although ghrelin's effects are partially mediated at the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, via activation of neurons that co-express neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein (NPY/Agrp neurons), the ghrelin receptor is expressed also in other brain sites. One of these is the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a primary node of the mesolimbic reward pathway, which sends dopaminergic projections to the nucleus accumbens (Acb), among other sites. We injected saline or three doses of ghrelin (0, 0.003, 0.03, or 0.3 nmol) into the \{VTA\} or Acb of rats. We found a robust feeding response with \{VTA\} injection of ghrelin, and a more moderate response with Acb injection. Because opioids modulate feeding in the \{VTA\} and Acb, we hypothesized that ghrelin's effects in one site were dependent on opioid signaling in the opposite site. The general opioid antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), injected into the Acb did not affect feeding elicited by ghrelin injection into the VTA, and \{NTX\} in the \{VTA\} did not affect feeding elicited by ghrelin injected into the Acb. These results suggest interaction of a metabolic factor with the reward system in feeding behavior, indicating that hedonic responses can be modulated by homeostatic factors.}}

Low-rate discharge performance decreases linearly with saturation. With the change in conductivity being distinctly non-linear, however, the high-rate capacity decreases substantially at low saturation. Cells become increasingly difficult to recharge effectively below critical saturation levels. These changes are influenced by the distribution of electrolyte within the separator. Using a simple model, the influence of the separator structure is examined. Low-rate capacity is independent of separator structure, consistent with it being able to wick electrolyte to the full height of the cell without significant variation of saturation. The preferred structure for a stable high-rate performance is low tortuosity, high anisotropy, and a low bulk density. Conversely, the recharge efficiency is best maintained as cells dry out with a structure having high tortuosity, minimum anisotropy, and small and uniform pore size. It is concluded that fibrous separators of this type should be designed according to the requirements of the application.}}

In artificial neural networks (ANN), this translates to the minimization of the error surface during training such that misclassification is minimized during generalization. However, since optimal training performance does not necessarily imply optimal generalization due to the possibility of overfitting or underfitting, we developed \{SEPA\} (Structure Evolution and Parameter Adaptation) which addressed these issues by simultaneously evolving \{ANN\} structure and weights. Since \{SEPA\} primarily relies on the perturbation function to bring variation in its population, this follow-up study aims to find out \{SEPAs\} evolvability, optimality, and robustness in other perturbation functions. Our findings indicate that \{SEPAs\} optimal generalization performances are stable and robust from the effect of the different perturbation functions. This is due to the feedback loop between its architecture evolution and weight adaptation such that any shortcoming of the former is compensated by the latter, and vice versa. Our results strongly suggest that proper \{ANN\} design requires simultaneous adaptation of \{ANN\} structure and weights to avoid one-sided or bias convergence to either the weight or architecture space.}}

Insulin enters the central nervous system (CNS) through the blood–brain barrier by receptor-mediated transport to regulate food intake, sympathetic activity and peripheral insulin action through the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and reproductive endocrinology. On a molecular level, some of the effects of insulin converge with those of the leptin signaling machinery at the point of activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), resulting in the regulation of ATP-dependent potassium channels. Furthermore, insulin inhibits neuronal apoptosis via activation of protein kinase B in vitro, and it regulates phosphorylation of tau, metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein and clearance of β-amyloid from the brain in vivo. These findings indicate that neuronal \{IR\} signaling has a direct role in the link between energy homeostasis, reproduction and the development of neurodegenerative diseases.}}

The approach provides conceptual information on the design of the reaction process in terms of feeding, bypassing and mixing patterns for reactive phases as well as on the existence of reactive separation sections within the network. The approach is highly computationally efficient since the superstructure model contains only the balance equations for the reactive phase. Such simplification is achieved with the help of a \{LLE\} transfer rate expression that has been developed from the work by Zheng et al. (1998), to predict the mass transfer from the reactive phase. A stochastic optimisation method, in the form of Tabu Search (TS), is used to explore the network. The approach is illustrated with two biochemical examples. The first one addresses extractive fermentation and will be presented to explain the individual aspects of the presented approach. The second presents an application to a complex biochemical reaction system: the aerobic growth of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.}}

The chapter shows that within relatively short period of time progress has been made to learn the complete phenotype of a given mutation, including its cellular site(s) of gene action, to a detailed hunt for the nucleotide changes that underlie a given mutation and the predicted consequences in protein structure and function. The researchers have shown with greater and greater clarity that no gene can be understood as functioning alone, and each one works in a context that is created by the properties of other genes in the genome, as well as by the organism's environment and physiology. This notion of context makes simple linear schemes, such as pathways and cycles less satisfying as ways of describing the full range of gene actions, despite the obvious appeal of the one-dimensional simplicity. Sometimes the output cells return an error message; while, sometimes the interactions among the interior cells adjust and the output cell contains a useful value. The establishment of the \{MHB\} in the early vertebrate neural tube is an example of this emerging view and the responses of genes, such as Engrailed-1 and Pax-2 to their genetic background serve as reminders of how important it is to consider the validity of each phenotype in both its isolated and interactive modes.}}

For optical applications that include transparent films and coatings, nanoparticles should be uniformly dispersed in the polymer film. Most commercially available nanoparticles are large agglomerates about 1 μm in maximum dimensions composed of primary particles with sizes ranging from 5 to 50 nm. The large agglomerates scatter light and are not directly suitable for optical systems. Ultrasonication of liquid suspensions was used to prepare stable dispersions from commercial titania nanopowders. The mean diameter of sonicated titania nanopowders was correlated inversely to the specific energy. After a rapid initial size reduction, continued ultrasonication lead to insignificant reduction and even reagglomeration of the particles. Both erosion and fracture mechanisms were observed. None of the commercial nanopowders were successfully broken to their primary particle sizes. Reagglomeration of the dispersion could be prevented by electrostatic stabilization with nitric acid or ammonium hydroxide when its zeta potential value was less than − 30 mV or greater than + 30 mV.}}

Results Angiogenesis, measured as microvessel counts, was highly correlated with \{MC\} tryptase-positive cell counts and that these parameters increase in agreement with tumor progression.

Phases of active hair growth, or anagen, are separated by periods of quiescence, or telogen. The duration of both phases varies greatly depending on the body site. Whether hairs are in anagen/telogen at the time of hair removal is important because only anagen hairs are particularly sensible to physical insults. Photo-epilation is a technique for long-term removal of unwanted hair by thermal destruction of the hair follicle and its reproductive system (stems cells). As melanin is the main chromophor existing in hair follicles the corresponding wavelength spectrum would range from ultraviolet up to infrared light. Furthermore longer wavelengths are preferred as the cromophor lies deep in the skin and the penetration of light is increasing with the wavelength. Thus, in the range of 600–1100 nm melanin absorption may be used for selective photothermolysis of hair follicles. Yet to be resolved questions for permanent destruction are the location of the key follicular target and the possible influence of the hair growth cycle on photothermolysis-induced hair removal. An overview on the individual physiology of the hair follicle is given to discuss the latest strategies for photo-epilation.}}

Nevertheless, functional genomics has produced examples of the use of metabolomics to elucidate the phenotypes of otherwise silent mutations. Despite several successes, we believe that future metabolomic studies must focus on the accurate measurement of the concentrations of unambiguously identified metabolites. The research community must develop databases of metabolite concentrations in cells that are grown in several well-defined conditions if metabolomic data are to be integrated meaningfully with data from the other levels of functional-genomic analysis and to make a significant contribution to systems biology.}}

Phox2B regulates \{HASH1\} which can control expression of genes of the Delta–Notch pathway. We previously showed that a subset of neuroblastoma cell lines highly expresses Delta-like 1 (Dlk1), which is a marker for the chromaffin lineage of the SNS. Notch3 is expressed in another subset of neuroblastoma cell lines and marks tumors from an alternative differentiation lineage.

Materials and Methods The distribution of \{APAs\} was prospectively recorded in 285 consecutive patients between October 2002 and November 2004. We defined an \{APA\} as any artery located within the periprostatic region running parallel to the dorsal vascular complex and extending caudal toward the anterior perineum, other than cavernous arteries, corona mortis and satellite arteries to the superficial and deep vascular complex. Results We identified 92 \{APAs\} in 72 of 285 patients (25%). Two distinct varieties of \{APAs\} were identified. In 10% of patients an \{APA\} coursed along the lateral aspect of the prostate, termed lateral APA, and in 13% an \{APA\} emerged through the levator ani fibers near the apical region of the prostate, termed apical APA. Five patients (1.7%) were found to have apical and lateral APAs. Conclusions \{APAs\} are more frequent than previously reported in the surgical literature. To our knowledge apical \{APAs\} have never been reported previously. The visualization and accessibility advantages of laparoscopy may account for a higher intraoperative \{APA\} identification rate. Their roles in continence and potency remain to be determined.}}

In contrast, p53 functions as a ‘gatekeeper’ inducing cell-cycle arrest or programmed cell death (apoptosis). Genetic alterations in \{MYC\} oncogene family members also contribute to dysregulated cell growth and have become important diagnostic and prognostic markers in specific paediatric tumours.

In this article, we present a case of \{PEH\} involving petrous and jugular foramen region due to the uncommon incidence. Case Description A 49-year-old female patient with a 4-year history of left-sided hearing loss and facial palsy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging disclosed the presence of a 6 × 6 × 5 cm lobular mass occupying the left petrous and jugulare region. This mass was hyperintense on both \{T1\} and \{T2\} weighted \{MR\} images and was enhanced strongly with gadolinium. No edema was found around the lesion. Preoperative digital subtraction angiogram examination showed that the lesion had a rich blood supply. Therefore, polyvinyl alcohol embolization was carried out to reduce bleeding during operation. A left-sided suboccipital extreme lateral approach was applied for craniotomy. The lesion was extradural and highly vascular with extension into the petrous bone. It was subtotally removed. Postoperative course of the patient was stable. Her neurologic evaluation was the same as preoperatively. Conclusion Surgical excision of the lesion is the main therapy. Radiotherapy should be given to patients whose lesion cannot be totally removed.}}

Methods: Two epileptic patients (one female, one male, 35 and 36 years old, respectively) were submitted to pre-surgical evaluation including history, neurological examination, long-term video-EEG monitoring, interictal and ictal SPET, \{MRI\} and fMRI, neuropsychological assessment. Invasive recordings (stereoelectroencephalography) were also performed. Results: In both patients ictal semiology was characterized by very stereotyped repetitive right arm movements, i.e. tapping towards the thorax (movement rate of 6–7 Hz and 3–4 Hz for the two subjects, respectively). Seizures in the first patient, whose epilepsy was cryptogenetic, originated from the right pre-SMA area, which was surgically removed. She is seizure free 2 years after the operation. In the second patient, in whom a right pre-frontal post-abscess porencephaly was disclosed, the epileptogenic zone included the lesion and surrounding areas, while the \{SMA\} area was involved less consistently. Conclusions: Even if, according to literature, \{SMA\} epilepsy is predominantly characterized by postural manifestations, ipsilateral repetitive movements could be a relevant sign in this kind of epilepsy, as showed in our first patient. The presence of similar semiology in the second patient, might suggest that the symptomatogenic zone involved \{SMA\} area.}}

Deep and systematic understanding of the phytochrome in higher plants is of crucial importance to molecular biology, purposeful improvement of environment in practice, especially molecular mechanism by which higher plants perceive UV-B stress. The last more than 10 years have seen rapid progress in this field with the aid of a combination of molecular, genetic and cell biological approaches. No doubt, what is the most important, is the application of Arabidopsis experimental system and the generation of various mutants regarding phytochromes (phy A–E). Increasing evidence demonstrates that phytochrome signaling transduction constitutes a highly ordered multidimensional network of events. Some phytochromes and signaling intermediates show light-dependent nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning, which implies that early signaling events take place in the nucleus and that subcellular localization patterns most probably represent an important signaling control point. The main subcellular localization includes nucleus, cytosol and chloroplasts, respectively. Additionally, proteasome-mediated degradation of signaling intermediates most possibly function in concert with subcellular partitioning events as an integrated checkpoint. What higher plants do in this way is to execute accurate responses to the changes in the light environment on the basis of interconnected subcellular organelles. By integrating the available data, at the molecular level and from the angle of eco-environment, we should be able to construct a solid foundation for further dissection of phytochrome signaling transduction in higher plants.}}

While a wide range of doses of IL-17 alone did not show the ability to stimulate the growth of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), bFGF, HGF, VEGF, \{CXCL5\} or \{CXCL8\} significantly induced the growth of \{HMVECs\} in vitro. When bFGF and IL-17 were used in combination, 10 or 100 ng/ml IL-17 enhanced 10 ng/ml bFGF-induced growth of HMVECs. Similarly, when \{HGF\} and IL-17 were combined together, 10 or 100 ng/ml IL-17 potentiated 10 ng/ml HGF-induced growth of HMVECs. When \{VEGF\} and IL-17 were used together, 10 ng/ml IL-17 did not significantly enhance 10 ng/ml VEGF-induced growth, whereas 100 ng/ml IL-17 clearly promoted 10 ng/ml VEGF-mediated proliferation of HMVECs. On the contrary, IL-17 did not augment CXCL5- and CXCL8-mediated growth. These results indicate that IL-17 itself does not have the capability to stimulate the growth of vascular endothelial cells, whereas IL-17 is able to selectively enhance the mitogenic activity of bFGF, HGF, and \{VEGF\} for vascular endothelial cells. Our findings also suggest that IL-17 may promote bFGF-, HGF- and VEGF-meadiated angiogenesis through enhancing bFGF-, HGF- and VEGF-induced growth of vascular endothelial cells.}}

Further exposure causes stomata to become sluggish in response to environmental stimuli. Exposure to elevated \{CO2\} stimulates rapid stomata closure in response to increased Ci. This reduction in gs may not be sustained over time as photosynthesis down-regulates and with it, gs. The relationship between gs and photosynthesis may not be constant because stomata respond more slowly to environmental changes than photosynthesis, and because elevated \{CO2\} may alter guard cell sensitivity to other signals. Also, reduced stomatal density (and gs) in response to long-term \{CO2\} enrichment suggests sustained reduction in gs. Elevated \{CO2\} is believed to ameliorate the deleterious \{O3\} effects by reducing gs and thus the potential \{O3\} flux into leaves. Confirmation that gs acclimation to \{CO2\} enrichment does not lessen over time is critical for developing meaningful \{O3\} flux scenarios.}}

The paper discusses the preparation of lithium soap-based soy greases using different fatty acids and the determination of crystallite structure of soap using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Lithium soaps with palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids were synthesized and mixed with soybean oil (SBO) and additives to obtain different grease compositions. \{TEM\} measurements have revealed that the soap crystallite structure impact grease consistency. Soap fiber length and their cross-linking mechanism in the matrix control grease consistency (National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) hardness, \{ASTM\} D-217 method). Lithium stearate-based soy grease has a relatively more compact fiber structure than Li palmitate. Linoleic acid (C18,  ) with two sites of CC unsaturation in the chain has a much thinner and more compact fiber network than oleic acid (C18, ). The presence of additive in grease produces a soap with looser network and larger fiber structure than similar grease containing no additive. A close analysis of grease microstructure will help in the development of better performing grease for industrial applications.}}

The retention of fetal membranes (RFM) in cows is hypothesized to be connected with the imbalance between production and neutralization of ROS. The efficiency of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative systems can be detected by the determination of single components of this system or by so-called total antioxidant capacity (TAC). In the present study, total antioxidant capacity was compared with previously measured parameters of antioxidative defence mechanisms in placental tissues of cows with respect to time of fetal membranes expulsion and mode of delivery. Placental samples were divided into: (A) caesarian section before term (272–277 days of pregnancy) without \{RFM\} (n = 9), (B) caesarian section before term with \{RFM\} (n = 14), (C) caesarian section at term (282–288 days of pregnancy) without \{RFM\} (n = 12), (D) caesarian section at term with \{RFM\} (n = 16), (E) spontaneous delivery at term without \{RFM\} (n = 8), (F) spontaneous delivery at term with \{RFM\} (n = 8). \{TAC\} was measured spectrophotometrically at 593 nm by use of 2,4,6-tri-pyridyl-s-triazine in homogenates of maternal and fetal part of placenta and expressed as μmol/g protein (mean ± S.E.M.). The values of \{TAC\} were significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) in the fetal than in maternal part in preterm samples (A – maternal: 27.24 ± 4.17 μmol/g prot, fetal: 63.67 ± 18.16, B – maternal: 49.80 ± 5.11, fetal: 70.96 ± 13.23).

In order to train the neural network, dual-phase (DP) steels with different morphology and volume fractions of martensite were deformed between 2 and 8%, at high temperature range of 150–450 °C. The results of this investigation show that there is a good agreement between experimental and predicted values and the well-trained neural network has a great potential in mechanical behavior modeling of \{DP\} steels.}}

We observed a single, cooled region centered around the mouth and nasal capsule that extended across the pit membrane at air temperatures above 20 °C. Both head and body temperatures of rattlesnakes increased linearly with air temperature. Head–body temperature differentials also increased with air temperature, but declined significantly at higher relative humidities. Rattling rattlesnakes exhibited significantly greater head–body temperature differentials than did resting rattlesnakes. We suggest that respiratory cooling may provide a thermal buffer for the thermoreceptive pit organs at high air temperatures, but caution that this adaptive hypothesis must be tested with direct neural or behavioral assays.}}

In particular, \{FEV1\} was recorded at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after drug administration; at the same times, with the exception of the 12th h, theophylline plasma concentrations were also measured. When compared to theophylline, bronchodilation induced by salmeterol was characterized by an earlier onset, a greater magnitude, and a longer duration. Given in combination with salmeterol, theophylline elicited a further slight increase in airway calibre with respect to the bronchodilator action of the β2-agonist alone, with \{FEV1\} changes which resulted to be statistically significant at the 4th, 6th and 8th h after administration (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.03 and p&lt;0.05, respectively). At the 4th h theophylline reached serum levels included within the therapeutic range, which were persistently maintained at least until the the 10th h. Therefore, our findings suggest that inhaled salmeterol and oral slow-release theophylline, the latter acting within the range of therapeutic plasma concentrations, exert additive bronchodilating effects in asthmatic patients with moderate to severe airflow limitation.}}

Both SIRPα and SHP-2 are highly expressed in brain. Murine cerebellar cells cultured on SIRPα-coated surface exhibit enhanced neurite outgrowth and SIRPα is localized at sites of synaptogenesis in postnatal mouse brain. In this study, we show that nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation resulted in elevated SIRPα expression during \{PC12\} differentiation. We also show that NGF-induced morphological differentiation, but not growth arrest response, was inhibited by ectopic SIRPα expression. \{PC12\} cells stably expressing SIRPα proliferated more rapidly than mock-transfected cells. The activity of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) decreased in SIRPα-transfected \{PC12\} cells, whereas nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity increased. Collectively, our results suggest that SIRPα may stabilize synaptic connections by inhibiting improper neurite outgrowth and might realize its neuronal function, at least in part, by modulating \{JNK\} and NF-κB activity.}}

In the development of a new \{EPS\} assay procedure, the reliability of the assay was assessed by adding a known amount of dextran to a fresh growth medium. Each processing step was then evaluated based on dextran recovery. Key improvements made to the \{EPS\} assay procedures included the use of Flavourzyme for protein hydrolysis; optimizing ethanol concentration to prevent lactose crystallization yet allowing complete \{EPS\} precipitation; and a suitable centrifugation regime to minimize \{EPS\} loss.

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the control processes inherent in the human body when subjected to thermal or exercise stress. The regulatory processes commonly named ‘thermoregulation’ comprise the interaction, and sometimes the competition, of various control systems such as the cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, osmoregulatory and thermal control systems. Understanding these processes correctly is essential for the estimation and evaluation of physiological strain in environmental ergonomics. Such systems stabilize body temperature in spite of external or internal loads, generally by means of an information loop with negative feedback. A controller network in the central nervous system activates effector mechanisms (such as metabolic heat production, sweat production and vasomotoric action) to an extent that is proportional to the deviation of the controlled variable from its so-called set-point. In hyper-or hypothermia, body temperature deviates substantially from the setpoint, mainly because of insufficient effector capacity. The set-point may change periodically (e.g. circadian rhythm) or temporarily, due to interference with the regulation of non-thermal variables (e.g. in states of dehydration or starvation, etc.), or due to pathological, non-thermal influences (e.g. during a fever). The processes of acclimatization may also change the set-point.}}

The carriers of the reactors had been aerated for 10 days before they were put into the \{AAFEB\} reactors. The results indicated that the reactors advance the start-up by 15 days, and maintain higher efficiency when they were subjected to organic and hydraulic loading shock, but during steady-state operation, the reactors did not show better performance than the control reactors without pre-aeration of carrier. The thicker biofilm and higher biomass concentration of the reactors with pre-aeration were observed during the start-up period, but the difference between two types of reactors tapered with the time course, and at the steady-state operation, the difference between two types of reactors on these two parameters was not obvious. Maximum specific methane or acids production rates, dehydrogenase activity and coenzyme \{F420\} content were continuously higher than those of the control reactors. After running 30 days, filamentous bacteria dominated in the reactors with pre-aeration, whereas the cocci were predominant species in the control reactors. It was suggested that the action of the biofilm is strongly dependent on the biofilm thickness or the biomass concentration in normal circumstances, but under adverse circumstances, such as organic or hydraulic loading shock, the characteristics and activity of the anaerobic granular sludge play key roles on the reactor performance. These results clearly indicated that pre-aeration of carrier favor to enhance the start-up and performance of \{AAFEB\} reactor.}}

Methods: Cardiac arrest data from two \{EMS\} systems were analyzed retrospectively. All witnessed arrests from patients who presented with a shockable rhythm and were treated initially by \{BLS\} personnel were included (n = 102). For each defibrillation and resuscitation outcome variable, we tested differences in mean \{TTI\} for successful versus unsuccessful outcome. The effect of call-to-shock time on overall outcome was also examined. Results: Initial shocks defibrillated 90% [83–95%] (95% confidence interval) of patients. Cumulative success with two shocks was 98% [93–100%] and with three shocks was 99% [95–100%]. \{TTI\} averaged 90 ± 23 Ω. First-shock success, cumulative success through two shocks and cumulative success through the first-shock series were unrelated to TTI, as were \{BLS\} ROSC, pre-hospital ROSC, hospital admission and discharge. In contrast and consistent with previous findings, call-to-shock time was highly predictive of survival. Conclusions: High impedance patients were defibrillated by the biphasic waveform used in this study at high rates with a fixed energy of 150 J and without energy escalation. Rapid defibrillation rather than differences in patient impedance accounts for resuscitation success.}}

abstract = {Summary Enteral nutrition with human milk lowers the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm human infants. Lactoferrin, the major whey protein in human milk, has many functions related to host defense against bacterial infection. Here, we hypothesize that lactoferrin also helps terminate bacterial invasion of enterocytes via a detachment-induced apoptosis called anoikis. Death of infected epithelia by anoikis prevents local spread of bacterial pathogens because the bacteria are trapped within the cell. Such infected, apoptotic and sloughed epithelia also cannot infect the lower gastrointestinal tract, and the epithelia exit the body in the stool. Currently, anoikis is a phenomenon related to the renewal of enterocytes, and it is not recognized as an anti-bacterial host defense. We suggest that anoikis of infected enterocytes is a process in which lactoferrin plays an important role. In a pilot study in which neonatal rats were pre-treated with intra-gastric recombinant human lactoferrin, we found evidence of epithelia with anoikis in ileal fluid after enteric infection. This finding was rarely seen in infected neonatal rats without pre-treatment with lactoferrin. Quantitative analysis of intestinal lavage specimens and quantitative stereology of apoptotic epithelia in this model will be required to verify the theory. We propose that oral use of recombinant human lactoferrin might have these hypothesized and other anti-bacterial effects in preterm infants, and hence, this protein might prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants who cannot take human milk.}}

abstract = {Summary We hypothesize that declining dynamic range and variation of environmental cues may contribute to health dysfunctions, and that judicious expansion of biologic dynamic ranges may be beneficial. Three disparate examples involving the endocrine, autonomic, and musculoskeletal systems are discussed. Daytime sheltering, optical shading, and nighttime use of artificial light may reduce circadian luminal variation. The resulting melatonin alterations may contribute to systemic dysfunctions. Loss of temporal variation of other hormones may contribute to biologic dysfunctions, especially those involving the hypothalamic–pituitary axis. Reduced variation of physical exertion, environmental stressors, and thermal gradients that characterize modern lifestyles may reduce the autonomic dynamic range resulting in lowered heart rate variability and a myriad of systemic dysfunctions. The health benefits of activities such as exercise, meditation, acupuncture, coitus, and laughter may operate through increasing autonomic variability. Reduced physical exertion also accounts for declining dynamic range of musculoskeletal function. The resulting muscle atrophy, fat infiltration, and sarcomere shortening may not only have deleterious local effects, but may also be involved in systemic metabolic dysfunctions such as insulin resistance. The extent to which our endogenous systems rely on environmental variation for self-tuning and the impact that under-utilization of compensatory mechanisms has on biologic function are not well understood. Modern therapeutic approaches generally result in reversion to the mean of physiologic functions and may buffer against variation. For example, beta-blockers are given to reduce adrenergic excess, insulin to treat insulin insufficiency, serotonin-reuptake inhibitors for depression, and refractive lenses for myopia. By undermining the demand for native compensatory functions, such therapeutic strategies may actually impair future ability to respond to biologic disequilibria. Generalizing from these observations, we anticipate benefits of therapeutic and lifestyle approaches that expand, rather than reduce, the dynamic range of many biologic experiences.}}

The malignant epithelium generated from this tissue ultimately loses dependence on androgens despite retention or amplification of the androgen receptor. Accumulating evidence support that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays key roles in the control of androgen dependence and acquisition of resistance to such hormonal control. Although TGF-β functions as a key tumour suppressor of the prostate, it can also promote malignant progression and metastasis of the advanced disease, through undefined mechanisms. In addition to giving an overview of the TGF-β field as related to its function in prostate cancer, this Review focuses on novel findings that support the tumour suppressor function of TGF-β is lost or altered by changes in the activity of the androgen receptor, insulin-like growth factor-I, Akt, and mTOR during malignant progression. Understanding the mechanisms of cross-talk between TGF-β and such growth modulators has important implications for the rational therapeutics of prostate cancer.}}

abstract = {Summary The increasing anthropogenic pressure on natural environments results in impacts that affect tropical forest areas and their biodiversity [1, 2]. Adverse impacts on terrestrial and oceanic environments often compound in the intertidal area, where mangrove forest ecosystems thrive. In tropical coastal areas of many developing countries where people depend on wood and other mangrove forest products and services, forest degradation leads to socioeconomic problems. At the same time, increasing freshwater needs in these areas are expected to cause additional problems [3–5]. On the basis of remote sensing and ground truthing complemented by colonial archival material from the Dutch East India Company (1602–1800), we report that changes to the historic system of inland freshwater management have increased dramatically in recent times. Hydrological changes, such as interbasin transfers, have resulted in a qualitative ecological and socioeconomic degradation in three coastal lagoons in southern Sri Lanka. Variations in river hydrology have caused changes in the areas suitable as mangrove habitat and, thus, have resulted in an altered distribution. However, increases in mangrove area can mask the degradation of the site in terms of floristic composition, significance of the species, and biodiversity (this effect is termed “cryptic ecological degradation”). It is important that such changes be carefully monitored to ensure biological and socioeconomic sustainability.}}

Here, the differences between mass-action and network-based models are investigated. This allows us to determine when mass-action models are a reliable tool, and suggest ways in which their behaviour should be refined.}}

Animals were tested in an experimental apparatus that consisted of a home cage (25×25×25 cm) connected to another chamber (25×25×25 cm-the food compartment) by a hallway (12.5 cm wide and 100 cm long, with 25-cm high walls). During 10 days before the testing procedures, each animal was isolated in the home cage, and, at the beginning of the dark phase, allowed to explore the rest of the apparatus and obtain food pellets stored in the food compartment. The testing consisted of three phases: exploring a familiar and safe environment (phase 1, on the 10th day), cat exposure (phase 2, on the 11th day), and, on the following day, exposure to the environment where the predator had been previously encountered (phase 3). These three conditions thus provided a low-defense baseline; a high level of freezing during cat exposure; and a high level of risk assessment to the hostile environment condition. An important feature of the present experimental procedure was that the behavioral responses were very stable among the animals tested within each individual phase of the testing schedule. In each phase of the testing schedule, we have also examined the Fos immunoreactivity in pontine periventricular sites related to controlling behavioral activation (i.e. the nucleus incertus) or attentional status (i.e. the locus coeruleus). Animals actively exploring a safe and familiar environment presented an increased activation of the nucleus incertus; the locus coeruleus, in turn, was particularly activated during cat exposure, and also, to lesser degree, during exposure to the hostile environment. These results give further support to the view that the animals present quite distinct behavioral states during each one of the testing situations. Taken together, the evidence suggests the present experimental procedure as particularly suitable for analyzing the neural basis of a number of specific defensive responses.}}

Each amino acid in a protein structure is a node, and the strength of the noncovalent interactions between two amino acids is evaluated for edge determination. The protein structure graphs (PSGs) for 232 proteins have been constructed as a function of the cutoff of the amino acid interaction strength at a few carefully chosen values. Analysis of such \{PSGs\} constructed on the basis of edge weights has shown the following: 1), The \{PSGs\} exhibit a complex topological network behavior, which is dependent on the interaction cutoff chosen for \{PSG\} construction. 2), A transition is observed at a critical interaction cutoff, in all the proteins, as monitored by the size of the largest cluster (giant component) in the graph. Amazingly, this transition occurs within a narrow range of interaction cutoff for all the proteins, irrespective of the size or the fold topology. And 3), the amino acid preferences to be highly connected (hub frequency) have been evaluated as a function of the interaction cutoff. We observe that the aromatic residues along with arginine, histidine, and methionine act as strong hubs at high interaction cutoffs, whereas the hydrophobic leucine and isoleucine residues get added to these hubs at low interaction cutoffs, forming weak hubs. The hubs identified are found to play a role in bringing together different secondary structural elements in the tertiary structure of the proteins. They are also found to contribute to the additional stability of the thermophilic proteins when compared to their mesophilic counterparts and hence could be crucial for the folding and stability of the unique three-dimensional structure of proteins. Based on these results, we also predict a few residues in the thermophilic and mesophilic proteins that can be mutated to alter their thermal stability.}}

Searches for therapeutic targets tend to concentrate on central integrative mechanisms and to largely ignore the visceral afferents and other peripheral mechanisms providing short-term controls of energy balance. Investigations of central mechanisms have yet to yield, however, any practical and effective treatments for correcting obesity. In this review, we survey some of the arguments for considering peripheral visceral afferent mechanisms as promising targets for future research on obesity. These arguments include (1) the observation that visceral afferents have the specializations, complexities, heterogeneities, and extensive distributions at key sites to provide exhaustive and dynamic feedback to control energy handling, (2) the fact that the most effective treatments yet developed for achieving long-term or permanent weight loss, namely gastroplasty and similar bariatric surgical procedures, clearly alter visceral afferent feedback from the gastrointestinal tract, and (3) experimental observations that suggest loss of visceral negative feedback can lead to overeating, positive energy balance, and obesity. Furthermore, even though excess adiposity is a disturbance in long-term energy regulation, it is instructive that obesity in the final analysis is developed, is maintained, and ultimately needs to be treated one meal at a time. When these considerations are taken in conjunction with concerns about side effects and risks that can be expected to accompany pharmacological therapies directed at central nervous system circuits, it would seem prudent to assess ways in which the feedback of visceral afferents might be enhanced or manipulated to support or synergize with other therapeutic strategies used in the management of excess energy intake.}}

abstract = {It is well known the fact that the world of technology is full of biological metaphors, as for instance, evolution, mutation, selection, life cycle, survival of the fittest, etc. One of the most powerful technological forecasting tools, the logistic equation, has its origin in the biological realm and has won the status of a ‘natural law’ of technology diffusion due to its considerable success as an empirically descriptive and heuristic device capturing the essential changing nature of technologies, products, markets and industries. Viewed on the most general level, living systems, from cells to societies, exhibit common properties, with some attending intrinsic fundamental invariants. Recognition of this fact in last decades is leading firmly to a new scientific paradigm, a complex bio-socio-economics, with the convergence of different fields of science toward what may be the clue to understand the modus operandi of ‘evolution’ per se—the development of evolutionary algorithms for many different problem-solving and/or theoretical applications. The fields of evolutionary computation and artificial life have reached a stage of some maturity and we are witnessing today an intense debate on ‘universal Darwinism’ as a broad theoretical framework for the analysis of the evolution of all open, complex systems, including socio-economic systems. This debate has been in great part centered on the striking similarities between biological evolution and technological/cultural evolution. This paper, divided into four parts, intends to present the state-of-the-art on this debate and tries to answer the question on the validity of evolutionary models of technological change. After some introductory thoughts in the first part, it is tried in the second part to summarize in five points some of the still missing pieces to complete the puzzle to developing a firmly based Evolutionary Theory of Technological Change (ETTC). Each of these five points are then discussed more in detail in the third part, being also commented on briefly the most promising approaches under way. The fourth part with conclusions closes the article, making six fundamental theoretical considerations that were not yet accounted for in formal models and/or simulations of technological systems stand out.}}

The output of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) block, which receives the given inputs, is fuzzified in the proposed two methods: one using compression property and other using multiresolution property. We present a new type of fuzzy neuron model, each non-linear synapse of which is characterized by a set of fuzzy implication rules with singleton weights in their consequents. It is shown that noise and disturbance in the reference signal are reduced with wavelets and also the variation of somatic gain, the parameter that controls the slope of the activation function in the neural network, leads to more accurate output. Identification results are found to be accurate and speed of their convergence is fast. Next, we simulate a control system for maintaining the output at a desired level by using the identified models. Self-learning \{FNN\} controller has been designed in this simulation. Simulation results show that the controller is adaptive and robust.}}

The neuronal death caused by different cerebellar mutations is mostly of an apoptotic nature. Apart from the identity of the intrinsic mechanisms of the mutations, adult cerebellar mutants are a powerful tool to causally study the development of the cerebellar connectivity. Thus, studies on adult cerebellar neuronal cell death occurring in mouse mutants elucidate: (i) the dependence of the postsynaptic neurons on their partners, (ii) the ‘en cascade’ postsynaptic transneuronal degeneration after target-deprivation, and (iii) the close relationship between the molecular modular organization of the cerebellar cortex and dying Purkinje cells. Neuronal cell death has been extensively studied in developing olivocerebellar system. However, less data are available on the occurrence of naturally occurring neuronal death during the in vivo normal development of the Purkinje cells and the mossy fiber system neurons. The developmental role of neuronal death during the establishment and refinement of the olivocerebellar projection is currently discussed. Moreover, the occurrence of neuronal death during the development of the basilar pontine nuclei and its role in the acquisition of the adult pontocerebellar projection is still poorly understood. In the present review, we correlate the dates of Purkinje cells death with the inferior olivary and basilar pontine neuronal apoptosis, discussing their developmental relationships during the elaboration of the fine-grained maps of the cerebellar afferent connections.}}

To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this process, we investigated the role of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), one of the candidate genes differentially expressed in Thy-1+ oval cells, in this liver injury model. Methods: Northern and Western analyses were performed to examine the induction of \{CTGF\} in total liver homogenate. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescent staining, and in situ hybridization were performed to confirm the expression and localization of \{CTGF\} in Thy-1+ oval cells. Finally, a known inhibitor of \{CTGF\} synthesis, Iloprost, was administered to 2-AAF/PHx treated rats to investigate the effect of Iloprost on oval cell response. Results: \{CTGF\} was found to be up-regulated at both the \{RNA\} and protein levels and occurred concurrently with an up-regulation of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). Sorted Thy-1+ oval cells expressed a high level of \{CTGF\} gene in a quantitative \{PCR\} assay. Colocalization of Thy-1 antigen and ctgf signals by in situ hybridization further confirmed that Thy-1+ oval cells were a source of CTGF. Iloprost administration blocked \{CTGF\} induction in treated animals but did not affect TGF-β1 expression. The inhibition of \{CTGF\} induction by Iloprost was associated with a significant decrease in oval cell proliferation and a lower level of α-fetoprotein expression as compared with control animals. Conclusions: These results show that \{CTGF\} induction is important for robust oval cell response after 2-AAF/PHx treatment in rats.}}

Although they have different underlying biochemical mechanisms, signal transduction units in prokaryotes and eukaryotes fulfill similar tasks, such as switching on or off a required process or amplifying a certain signal. The growing amount of data available allows the development of increasingly complex models which offer a detailed picture of signaling networks, but the properties of these systems as a whole become difficult to grasp. A sound strategy to untangle this complexity is a decomposition into smaller units or modules. How modules should be delimited, however, remains an unanswered question. We propose that units without retroactive effects might be an interesting criterion. In this contribution, this issue will be explored through several examples, starting with a simple two-component system in Escherichia coli up to the complex epidermal growth factor signaling pathway in human cells.}}

The different metaphors had significant effects on the constructed hypertexts, the construction process, and knowledge acquisition. The book metaphor encouraged a more linear way of viewing hypertexts that conflicted with the complexity of the contents to be processed. The space metaphor permitted a correspondence between complex semantic structures and complex hypertext structures. Hence, the space metaphor seems to be more appropriate for explaining the text format hypertext to students.}}

However, \{HBX\} protein may not be stable in apoptotic cells triggered by its own expression as only its mRNA or the fusion protein with the glutathione-S-transferase was detected in transfected cells.

Three pairs of Helmholtz coils around the sample induce a homogeneous rotating magnetic field being able to generate a controlled fluid flow in the melt close to the growing solid–liquid interface. The application of rotating magnetic fields during directional solidification results in pronounced segregation effects, leading to a deformation of the solidification front. For high magnetic field strengths, a change to pure eutectic solidification at the axis of the sample is observed. The investigations show that with increasing fluid flow the primary dendrite spacing decreases whereas the secondary dendrite arm spacing increases.}}

Nitric oxide (NO) and epoxyarachidonic acids are P450-dependent monooxygenase products and prostacyclin is formed via cyclooxygenase and a heme-thiolate isomerase. The corresponding vasorelaxant mechanisms are counteracted by superoxide which not only traps \{NO\} but through the resulting peroxynitrite blocks prostacyclin synthase by nitration of an active site tyrosine residue. In a model of septic shock, this leads to vessel constriction by activation of the thromboxane A2–prostaglandin endoperoxide \{H2\} receptor. This sequence of events is part of endothelial dysfunction in which the activated vascular smooth muscle counteracts and regenerates vessel tone by cyclooxygenase-2-dependent prostacyclin synthesis. Peroxynitrite was found to activate cyclooxygenases by providing the peroxide tone at nanomolar concentrations. Such new insights into the control of vascular function have allowed us to postulate a concept of redox regulation in which a progressive increase of superoxide production by NADPH-oxidase, mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, and even uncoupled NO-synthase triggers a network of signals originating from an interaction of \{NO\} with superoxide.}}

abstract = {Posidonia oceanica is a slow growing seagrass species that extends via growing rhizomes that grow only centimetres both horizontally and vertically each year. Posidonia oceanica forms topographically complex biogenic reefs of dead rhizome and sediments that are up to 4 m in height that are called “matte”. This study investigates the role of slow horizontal and vertical growth of rhizomes in the formation of topographic complexity in P. oceanica matte using agent-based modelling. The simulated infilling of landscapes by P. oceanica was run over 600 iterations (years) for 10 random starts of 150 agents each. Initial infilling rates were very slow and P. oceanica had limited cover after a century of growth. Growth accelerated after 100 years but plateaued after 400 years such that after 600 years only two-thirds of the landscape was occupied by P. oceanica. The pattern of spread of agents was initially random in direction but after larger patches were formed spread was radial from these patches. The seagrass landscape was initially highly fragmented with many small separate patches made up of a few agents each, with a Landscape Division index close to 1. Between 300 and 600 years Landscape Division declined sharply to 0.42, indicating patches had coalesced into larger more continuous meadows forming a less fragmented landscape. Perimeter to area ratio of seagrass patches declined exponentially from &gt;1 to approximately 0.2 over 600 years of simulation. The matte developed from growth of patches and its greatest height occurred in more continuously occupied cells of the grid. The topography of the reef that occupied two-thirds of the landscape after six centuries of growth could be described as a pattern of channels between reef plateaus elevated 1–2 m above channels. These results demonstrate that development in P. oceanica meadows of three-dimensional structure, in the formation of biogenic reefs, can be explained by, and is an emergent property of, slow horizontal and vertical rhizome growth rates combined with the time it takes for the accumulation of rhizomes in any region of the landscape. As such, the model provides a parsimonious explanation for the development of complex matte topography.}}

In the case of Phragmites australis, anthropogenic linear wetlands such as roadside and agricultural ditches are believed to play a key role in invasion patterns. Accurate remote sensing of an aquatic macrophyte in such narrow habitats, however, remains a challenge. We used large-scale (1/8000) panchromatic and color aerial photographs to produce different distribution maps of P. australis in a network of linear wetlands. Accuracy assessments were conducted to compare the two classifications and sources of errors were identified using logistic regressions. Different thresholds of stem abundance (1%, 5%, 20%, and 40%) were used in the error matrices to determine the stem abundance at which our classification is optimized. Results show that color images are much better in enabling the detection of P. australis. Producer's accuracy ranges from 44% to 71% (depending on the selected threshold of stem abundance) for color images and from 16% to 28% for panchromatic images. User's accuracy ranges from 84% to 55% for color photographs and from 51% to 28% for panchromatic photographs. Generally, the mapping of vigorous populations is more accurate. The presence of Typha sp. is the main source of commission errors. Landscape context also affects the mapping accuracy. We discuss the relevance of our results for mapping invasion patterns in narrow linear wetlands.}}

To date, it remains unclear whether stem cell are effective following transplantation into the injured brain via either cell replacement, trophic support, or manipulation of the local environment to stimulate endogenous neuroprotection/regeneration. This paper will review the most current and exciting pre-clinical data regarding the utility of cellular transplantation in experimental models of TBI.

Poor cell adhesion to orthopaedic and dental implants results in implant failure.

We investigated the effect of surface chemistry modification of titanium alloy (Ti–6Al–4V) with zinc, magnesium or alkoxide-derived hydroxy carbonate apatite (CHAP) on the regulation of key intracellular signalling proteins in human bone-derived cells (HBDC) cultured on these modified Ti–6Al–4V surfaces. Western blotting demonstrated that modifying Ti–6Al–4V with \{CHAP\} or Mg results in modulation of key intracellular signalling proteins. We showed an enhanced activation of Shc, a common point of integration between integrins and the Ras/Mapkinase pathway. Mapkinase pathway was also upregulated, suggesting its role in mediating osteoblastic cell interactions with biomaterials. The signalling pathway involving c-fos (member of the activated protein-1) was also shown to be upregulated in osteoblasts cultured on the Mg and \{CHAP\} modified Ti–6Al–4V. Thus surface modification with \{CHAP\} or Mg may contribute to successful osteoblast function and differentiation at the skeletal tissue–device interface.}}

Intervention(s) Peripheral venous blood sampling; laparoscopic collection of ectopic and matched eutopic endometrium. Main Outcome Measure(s) Messenger \{RNA\} (mRNA) for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-10 expression in peripheral and endometrium lymphocytes was assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; intracellular synthesis of these cytokines and lymphocyte phenotype profile were established by flow cytometry. Result(s) Both mRNA expression and intracellular synthesis of IL-4 and IL-10 were sharply increased in peripheral lymphocytes. The same changes were observed for IL-4 in ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Simultaneously, elevation of the amount of pan-B cells, CD20+CD5+ B-1 cells, and activated HLA-DR+CD20+ B lymphocytes was observed in endometriosis lesions. Only an enhanced amount of B lymphocytes was seen in eutopic endometrium. Conclusion(s) Endometriosis development is accompanied by the activation of a T-helper type 2 immune response at the systemic and local levels. Our results support the hypothesis regarding the autoimmune nature of endometriosis and can explain the high level of autoantibody production in patients with endometriosis.}}

TGF-β can act as a regulator of proliferation, migration, survival, differentiation, and extracellular matrix synthesis in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. Importantly, genetic studies in humans have revealed the pivotal role of TGF-β as well as its signaling components in angiogenesis. Mutations in two TGF-β receptors (ie, the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1 and the accessory TGF-β receptor endoglin) have been linked to vascular disorders named hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In addition, knockout mice for the different components of the TGF-β signaling pathway have shown that TGF-β is indispensable for angiogenesis. Recent studies have revealed that TGF-β can regulate vascular homeostasis by balancing the signaling between two distinct TGF-β type I receptors (ie, the endothelial-restricted \{ALK1\} and the broadly expressed \{ALK5\} receptors). The activation of these receptors has been shown to induce opposite effects on endothelial cell behavior and angiogenesis. In this review, we will present recent advances in understanding the role of TGF-β signaling in endothelial cells as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms by which perturbation of this pathway can lead to vascular disorders.}}

The lipoxygenases (LOs), a family of lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that induce structural and metabolic changes in the cell in a number of pathophysiological conditions, belong to the oxygenases family. This class of enzymes has several subgroups, named 5-, 8-, 12- and 15-LOs, and these LO-isoforms are capable of oxygenating arachidonic and linoleic acid. 15-LOs were reported to play an inhibitory role in tumor angiogenesis and, consequently, they slow down carcinogenesis. It has been suggested that its anti-carcinogenic effect is conferred by promoting cell differentiation and apoptosis. Using transgenic mice that over-express 15-LO-1 in endothelial cells under the regulation of the murine preproendothelin-1 promoter, we studied its effect on tumor and metastasis growth. We found that 15-LO-1 inhibited tumor and metastasis growth in the transgenic mice in two different models of cancer (mammary gland and Lewis lung carcinoma). This inhibition was concomitant with a higher number of apoptotic cells in the metastases of the transgenic mice and with a complicated network of multiple small blood vessels. This finding targets 15-LO as a new candidate in the treatment of carcinogenesis.}}

However, the knowledge about sulphate reduction and the effect on the removal of C and N in constructed wetlands is still limited. Investigations in laboratory-scale constructed wetland reactors were performed to evaluate the interrelation of carbon and nitrogen removal with the sulphate reduction by use of artificial domestic wastewater. Carbon removal was found to be only slightly affected and remained at high levels of efficiency (75–90%). Only at sulphate reduction intensities above 75 mg l−1 (50% removal), a decrease of carbon removal of up to 20% was observed. A highly contrary behaviour of ammonia removal was found in general, which decreased exponentially from 75% to 35% related to a linear increase of sulphate reduction up to 75 mg l−1 (50% removal). Since sulphate removal is considered to be dependant on the load of electron donors, the carbon load of the system was varied. Variation of the load changed the intensities of sulphate reduction immediately, but did not influence the carbon removal effectiveness. Doubling of the carbon concentration of 200 mg l−1 \{BOD5\} for domestic wastewater usually led to sulphate reduction of up to 150 mg l−1 (100% removal). The findings show that, particularly in constructed wetland systems, the sulphur cycle in the rhizosphere is of high importance for performance of the waste water treatment and may initiate a reconsideration of the amount of sulphate present in the tap water systems.}}

abstract = {Dietary restriction (DR) by dilution of the food medium can extend lifespan in Drosophila. \{DR\} results in a state that is characterized by reduced fecundity, increased starvation resistance and higher total lipid levels. In the past, each of these correlated phenotypes has been proposed to play a causal role in the lifespan-extending effects of food reduction. However, more recent data show that each phenotype can be uncoupled from the long-lived state to varying extents. In this mini-review, we summarize the principal findings of the effects of \{DR\} on Drosophila in order to address what these phenotypes can tell us about the physiological remodeling required for Drosophila to be long-lived. Current data indicate lifespan-extension by \{DR\} is likely to involve both enhancement of various defense and detoxification mechanisms and a complex range of metabolic alterations that make energy available for these processes.}}

Microdialysis has been extensively used to study small molecules such as neurotransmitters, metabolites and drugs in the brain and other tissues. There has been increasing interest in measuring proteins using microdialysis. Optimizing protein recovery requires slow buffer flow rates, large pore membranes and osmotic balancing. An examination of a widely used commercially available large pore (100 kDa MWCO) polymeric microdialysis probe, the CMA/20 (polyethersulfone) over 6 days of continuous microdialysis showed that: (1) published molecular weight cut-off values may not predict the size of proteins that can be recovered. This membrane had an effective molecular weight cut-off values (MWCO) of about 29 kDa, (2) protein recoveries decrease over time, (3) small proteins are much less affected than larger ones and (4) there can be significant differences in the recovery of proteins similar in size perhaps due to reaching of a critical size, protein aggregation, shape, surface charge or hydrophobicity.}}

Previous studies have measured high levels of cytokines in the urine and plasma in various renal dysfunction states. However, some methods used to measured cytokines hinder their use as a diagnostic tool in renal rejection. In this report, cytokine levels were determined in the plasma and urine of kidney transplant patients, with renal rejection and without it, using a cytometric bead array (CBA) technique. Concentrations of six human cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF-α and INF-γ) were established. Results show that patients who develop renal rejection presented high levels of IL-10 and IFN-γ cytokines in plasma and urine compared to patients without renal rejection. The \{CBA\} technique displayed greater sensitivity in the determination of cytokines in urine than the conventional \{ELISA\} technique. Finally, when standard cytokines in plasma and in urine were compared, it was observed that, in plasma, levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ were detected, whereas in urine the levels detected were of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-γ. These results indicate that the \{CBA\} assay is a sensitive method to measure cytokines in urine. In kidney transplant patients undergoing acute renal rejection, the presence of cytokines in urine reflects renal damage and could be a useful method in the diagnosis of renal rejection.}}

A new microfabrication process was developed that compared to earlier work in our institute [R.B.M. Schasfoort, S. Schlautmann, J. Hendrikse, A. van den Berg, Science 286 (1999) 942] leads to mechanically more robust structures and better flow visualization in the gate region. In the new process sequence, the microfluidic chips were fabricated using deposition on a Pyrex glass substrate of a thin-film metal electrode, which was covered with a thin insulating film of silicon dioxide, followed by chemical mechanical polishing prior to bonding to a second glass plate to form closed microchannels. Electrical breakdown of the metal–insulator structures was measured and occurred at 9.6 ± 0.3 MV/cm. Experiments using fluorescent beads to visualize the flow patterns in the microchannel showed that the \{EOF\} is linearly dependent on the applied gate voltage. The average \{EOF\} could be stopped completely for longitudinal fields of 150 V/cm by applying a gate field of 1.7 MV/cm.}}

Recently, several kinetic and physicochemical models have been developed to describe and predict synergistic responses. In this article, the mechanisms that control the magnitude and timing of cellular synergism are discussed. We suggest that the analysis of theoretical models could enable a general prediction of synergism despite the presence of signal-specific synergistic responses. In addition, application of the proposed concepts should aid understanding of the wide occurrence of synergism induced by interacting transduction pathways in multi-drug clinical treatment.}}

Method: Using cDNA gene array technology, we profiled the mRNA expression of 1176 genes in a rat model of acute otitis media. We identified changes in gene expression two-fold or greater 12 and 48 h after bilateral \{ME\} inoculation with either tryptic soy broth (TSB) or Streptococcus pneumoniae in TSB. Results: Transcripts of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules were up-regulated by 12 h, but returned to placebo transcription levels by 48 h. Three of six stress-response genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase, \{GADD45\} and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) were up-regulated by 12 h, with \{HSP27\} transcription levels continuing to rise through 48 h. All assayed transcription factors were up-regulated by 12 h, but only c-fos and c-jun up-regulation persisted to the 48-h time point. Up-regulation of apoptosis-related genes, except for bcl-x, was not evident until 48 h. These gene expression patterns reflected an early proinflammatory response consisting of cytokines, cell adhesion and stress-response molecules at 12 h followed by an up-regulation of apoptosis-related genes at 48 h. Conclusion: Downstream targets of several transcription factors, up-regulated transiently at 12 h, control secondary effects of S. pneumoniae infection, including apoptosis of neutrophils and mucosal epithelial cells, bone proliferation and promotion of leukocyte differentiation. These observations lead to a greater understanding of the early events in the pathogenesis of an \{AOM\} episode and highlight therapeutic targets, which may play a roll in the sequelae of AOM.}}

Various families of antimicrobial peptides have been identified, including the cathelicidins. Cathelicidins are characterized by a conserved N-terminal cathelin domain and a variable C-terminal antimicrobial domain that can be released from the precursor protein after cleavage by proteinases. LL-37 is the C-terminal part of the only human cathelicidin identified to date called human cationic antimicrobial protein (hCAP-18), which is mainly expressed by neutrophils and epithelial cells. In addition to killing a broad spectrum of microorganisms, LL-37 was demonstrated to display various cellular activities related to inflammation including cytotoxicity to host cells, chemotaxis, epithelial cell activation, angiogenesis and epithelial wound repair. Focussing on this recent information, this review discusses the role of LL-37 in infection and inflammation in the lung. In addition, the importance of the fact that antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37 display a range of activities for the design and development of antimicrobial peptides for therapeutic use is discussed.}}

Despite their apparent promiscuity, the \{NOS\} isoforms support specific signaling because of their subcellular compartmentation with colocalized effectors and limited diffusibility of \{NO\} in muscle cells. eNOS and nNOS sustain normal \{EC\} coupling and contribute to the early and late phases of the Frank–Starling mechanism of the heart. They also attenuate the beta1-/beta2-adrenergic increase in inotropy and chronotropy, and reinforce the pre- and post-synaptic vagal control of cardiac contraction. By doing so, the \{NOS\} protect the heart against excessive stimulation by catecholamines, just as an “endogenous beta-blocker”. In the ischemic and failing myocardium, induced iNOS further reinforces this effect, as does eNOS coupled to overexpressed beta3-adrenoceptors. nNOS expression also increases in the aging and infarcted heart, but its role (compensatory or deleterious) is less clear. In addition to their direct regulation of contractility, the \{NOS\} modulate oxygen consumption, substrate utilization, sensitivity to apoptosis, hypertrophy and regenerative potential, all of which illustrate the pleiotropic effects of this radical on the cardiac cell biology.}}

Mitochondrial function is regulated in complex ways by several agonists and environmental conditions, through activation of specific transcription factors and signalling pathways. A key player in this scenario is nitric oxide (NO). Its binding to cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is reversible and in competition with oxygen, plays a role in acute oxygen sensing and in the cell response to hypoxia. Evidence of the last two years showed that \{NO\} has also long-term effects, leading to biogenesis of functionally active mitochondria, that complement its oxygen sensing function. Mitochondrial biogenesis is triggered by \{NO\} through activation of guanylate cyclase and generation of cyclic GMP, and yields formation of functionally active mitochondria. Thus, the combined action of \{NO\} at its two known intracellular receptors, cytochrome c oxidase and guanylate cyclase, appears to play a role in coupling energy generation with energy demand. This may explain why dysregulation of the \{NO\} signalling pathway is often associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders.}}

The network dynamic behaviors are discussed. The numerical simulations are shown that, an optimal solution of the quadratic problems is an equilibrium point of the neural dynamics, and vise versa. We show that these networks find the solution of both primal and dual problems, and converge to the corresponding exact solutions globally.

These interactions can be studied in the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle isolated preparations. We had previously shown that in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), the opioid acute withdrawal response is under the inhibitory control of several systems; μ-opioid agonist exposure indirectly activates the κ-opioid system; conversely, exposure to a κ-opioid agonist indirectly activates the μ-system; the indirectly activated opioid system inhibits the withdrawal response. The adenosine \{A1\} system is also indirectly activated by opioids and it inhibits the withdrawal response. We had also shown that indirect activation is prevented or antagonized by cholecystokinin (CCK-8). In \{GPI\} preparations briefly exposed to the μ-agonist, dermorphine (DERM) and then challenged with naloxone (NL), the cannabinoid \{CB1\} antagonist, \{SR141716\} (SR), increased the withdrawal responses to NL, but only did so in presence of a κ-opioid and an adenosine \{A1\} antagonist. Under similar experimental conditions, \{SR\} also enhances the κ-opioid withdrawal response. In opioid agonist/CCK-8/NL tests, \{SR\} antagonized the inhibition of the tissue response to CCK-8 induced by the μ- or κ-opioid agonist and increased the κ-withdrawal response, but not the μ-withdrawal response. However, the dose–response curve against dermorphine inhibition of the response to CCK-8 was bell-shaped and the highest \{SR\} concentration also significantly decreased the μ-withdrawal response. In preparations exposed to dermorphine or to the κ-agonist, U-50,488H, the cannabinoid agonist \{WIN\} 55,212-2 increased the opioid-induced inhibition of the tissue response to CCK-8 and decreased the NL-induced responses. These results show that opioid exposure may also activate the cannabinoid \{CB1\} system, which leads to an inhibition of the opioid acute withdrawal response. This phenomenon and the antagonistic effect of \{SR\} on the opioid-induced inhibition of the response to CCK-8 suggest that reciprocal interaction between opioid and cannabinoid systems are operating in the enteric nervous system.}}

The heat-induced formation of cadmium sulfide was studied by thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal analysis, while the chemistry of the reaction forming the CdS/PS compound was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The structural characterization was performed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The CdS nanocrystals are single crystals of cubic phase (zincblende structure) of spherical shape. The average diameter of the nanocrystals embedded in the polystyrene matrix achieved by our synthesis process is as small as 2.5 ± 0.5 nm. Room temperature UV–VIS absorption spectra exhibit a shoulder at 412 nm that is consistent with the presence of CdS nanocrystals of ∅ ≈ 2 nm. The role of the polymer on the nanoparticle growth was also discussed.}}

In this report, we analyzed the mechanisms of Chk1 regulation in \{U87MG\} glioblastoma cells using Geldanamycin (GA), which interferes with the function of Hsp90. \{GA\} reduced Chk1 protein level but not its mRNA level in glioblastoma cells. Co-treatment with \{GA\} and cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor, induced a decrease of half-life of the Chk1 protein to 3 h and resulted in Chk1 down-regulation. \{CHX\} alone induced only 32% reduction of Chk1 protein even after 24 h. These findings indicated that reduction of Chk1 by \{GA\} was due to destabilization and degradation of the protein. In addition, GA-induced down-regulation of Chk1 was reversed by MG132, a specific proteasome inhibitor. And it was revealed that Chk1 was ubiquitinated by GA. These results have indicated that degradation of Chk1 by \{GA\} was mediated by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway in \{U87MG\} glioblastoma cells.}}

At present, the annual lactic acid production is about 100,000 t, most of that from the fermentation of carbohydrates. The disadvantages of this process are small space-time-yields and the production of stoichiometric amounts of salt. In pure sub- and supercritical water (SCW) only small amounts of lactic acid are obtained from the degradation of carbohydrates. But by adding small quantities of metal ions such as Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) to that reaction media, the lactic acid yield is increased up to 42% (g g−1) starting from sucrose and 86% (g g−1) starting from dihydroxyacetone at 300 °C and 25 MPa. Zn(II) gave the best results with regard to the lactic acid yield. The function of the catalyst in the complex reaction network of carbohydrate degradation is discussed. An alternative lactic acid production process is proposed.}}

Such potent responses are kept under tight control by a class of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, the lipoxins. Here, we review such immune-containment strategies from the host's perspective, to keep pro-inflammatory responses under control during chronic disease, as well as from the perspective of the pathogen, which pirates the host's lipoxygenase machinery to its own advantage as a probable immune-escape mechanism.}}

abstract = {Ca2+ signalling governs stimulated exocytosis and exocytosis-coupled endocytosis also in Paramecium cells. Upon stimulation, the ≤103 dense-core exocytotic organelles (trichocysts) can be synchronously (80 ms) released, followed by endocytotic membrane resealing (350 ms) and retrieval. Paramecium is the most synchronous dense-core exocytotic system known, allowing to dissect rapidly reversible Ca2+-dependent phenomena. This holds for the reversible de-/re-phosphorylation cycle of a 63 kD phosphoprotein, pp63/parafusin (pf), which we have cloned, immuno-localised, and characterised as phosphoglucomutase, the enzyme funneling glucose into the glycolytic pathway. It was isolated ex vivo, followed by \{MALDI\} analysis, while X-ray structure analysis was performed after heterologous expression. We found multiple phosphorylation of superficial Ser/Thr residues. Although present also in exo− mutants, pp63/pf is selectively de-phosphorylated only in exo+ strains during synchronous exocytosis (80 ms) and re-phosphorylated within ∼20 s, i.e., the time required to re-establish [Ca2+] homeostasis. We have isolated relevant protein phosphatases and kinases and probed their activity on pp63/pf in vitro. We consider Ca2+/calmodulin-activated \{PP2B\} (calcineurin, whose subunits have been cloned) relevant for de-phosphorylation. Re-phosphorylation can be achieved by two protein kinases that also have been cloned. One is activated by cGMP (PKG) which in turn is formed by Ca2+-activated guanylate cyclase. Another kinase, casein kinase 2, is inhibited by Ca2+ and, hence, activated with some delay in parallel to decreasing [Ca2+] after exocytosis. In total, several Ca2+-sensitive cycles cooperate whose protein components have been localised to the cell cortex. Regulation of the phosphorylation degree of pp63/pf may affect structure binding on a microscale and/or its enzymatic activity. All this may serve fueling substrate into glycolysis with increased \{ATP\} re-formation (compromised in exo− mutants) and \{NADH\} formation, with effects on Ca2+ signalling including mobilisation from cortical stores (alveolar sacs) and overall effects on \{ATP\} and Ca2+ dynamics during synchronous exo- and endocytosis.}}

abstract = {Objectives: To validate a method for the chronic implantation of micro-cannulae to examine the effect of drug administration to two small brain regions critical to the control of generalised seizures, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (Rt) and the ventrobasal thalamus (VB), in a genetically epileptic rat model. Method: Micro-cannulae guides (length 9 mm, 26 G, i.d. 0.24 mm, o.d. 0.46 mm) were implanted bilaterally into either the Rt or the \{VB\} of 11- to 13-week-old Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) using a stereotaxic head frame. After a seven-day recovery period the animals were injected with 0.2 μl of methylene blue. The animals were allowed to move freely in their cages for a further 90 min while a post-drug \{EEG\} recording was acquired and then brains were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and extracted. Twenty-micrometer slices were cut on a cryostat and the site and extent of the methylene blue staining in the brain determined. The implantation co-ordinates were adjusted accordingly, and then a validation study was performed on a further cohort of rats (n = 8 Rt, n = 7 VB). Results: The co-ordinates that were found to most accurately localise the Rt were: \{AP\} −3 mm, \{ML\} 3.6 mm, \{DV\} −5.8 mm (relative to Bregma). Those that accurately localised the \{VB\} were: \{AP\} −3 mm, \{ML\} 2.6 mm, \{DV\} −5.5 mm. In the validation study, the dye staining was measured to diffuse an average radius of 520 ± 120 μm from the centre of the injection site for the 0.2 μl injection in both brain hemispheres. For the \{VB\} injections the dye remained confined within the structure, however, for the smaller Rt there was spread to surrounding structures in the axial plane. The radial diffusion for the 0.5 μl injection was similar, but more of the dye was found to spread back up the cannula tract away from the target zone. Conclusion: These studies have validated a method for accurate and localised injection of drugs into the \{VB\} and Rt for neuropharmacological studies in a rat model of generalised epilepsy. This method allows the measurement of localised drug effects on \{EEG\} and generalised seizure activity at these sites.}}

This is seen by the increasing use of clinically relevant computational models and a rise in systems biology companies working with the pharmaceutical industry. Systems models have helped understand the effects of pharmacological intervention at receptor, intracellular and intercellular communication stages of cell signaling. For instance, angiogenesis models at the ligand–receptor interaction level have suggested explanations for the failure of therapies for cardiovascular disease. Intracellular models of myeloma signaling have been used to explore alternative drug targets and treatment schedules. Finally, modeling has suggested novel approaches to treating disorders of intercellular communication, such as diabetes. Systems modeling can thus fill an important niche in therapeutics by making drug discovery a faster and more systematic process.}}

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of \{FK506\} on fracture healing in the rat. Eighty Lewis rats were divided into four groups, which received \{FK506\} (1 mg/kg BW) or no treatment for 2 or 4 weeks, beginning after production of a closed, nondisplaced unilateral tibial fracture. Radiographic, histological, and biomechanical studies were used to evaluate fracture healing and histomorphometric analysis of the tibial metaphysis of the intact contralateral side was performed. Radiographs revealed no difference of the healing of the control fractures compared with the fractures in the FK506-treated group at 2 and 4 weeks. The mechanical parameters of the tested contralateral intact tibiae and of the fracture callus demonstrated no difference between control and immunosuppressed animals. Tibial bone histomorphometry revealed increased measures of bone formation and bone resorption, accompanied by a significant reduction of percent trabecular area. At 4 weeks, the fractures showed osseous healing with woven bone at the fracture site and only minimal amounts of cartilage. Histological grading was not different between the control and the \{FK506\} group at both time points. We conclude that systemic application of \{FK506\} has no biomechanical and histological effects of experimental fracture healing in the rat. However, resorption far in excess of formation leads to a net bone loss in the trabecular bone of the tibia that has no effect on the stability of the intact bone.}}

In this study, we evaluate the adhesion properties of \{ECs\} on two types of polyelectrolyte films ending either by poly(d-lysine) (PDL), or poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and compared them to data obtained on \{PDL\} or \{PAH\} monolayers, glass and fibronectin (Fn)-coated glass. \{ECs\} seeded on polyelectrolyte films showed a good morphology, allowing \{ECs\} to resist physiological shear stress better compared to \{ECs\} seeded on glass or Fn. The expression of β 1 integrins was slightly lower on polyelectrolyte films than on control surfaces. However, the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, involved in the transduction of adhesion signal, was not modified on \{PAH\} ending films compared to control surfaces; whereas it became lower on \{PDL\} ending films. Finally, \{PAH\} ending films improve strongly \{ECs\} adhesion without disturbing the adhesion mechanism, necessary for the development of a new endothelium. These types of films or similar build-ups could thus be used in the future as a way to modify surfaces for vascular tissue engineering.}}

This damaging earthquake occurred on a conjugate right-lateral blind fault that was inconsistent with the stress-change field calculated for preceding large earthquakes in the region. In this paper, four reasons which might be responsible for this stress discrepancy are identified and investigated individually. Firstly, co-seismic stress changes are considered. The time frame of the previous stress calculations is extended to include the large earthquakes in the 1780s which were not included in the earlier study. A sensitivity analysis is then conducted on the more recent events since 1822 to examine the effect of errors in their location and sizes. The possibility of the occurrence of a small magnitude event close to the 2003 epicentre is considered. We argue that, barring the occurrence of a low-probability, unmodelled local event, the Bingol earthquake was unlikely to have been triggered by co-seismic stress transfer from any known sequence of previous earthquakes. Finally we examine and modify the secular loading model used in the 2002 study and show that loading which is properly constrained by regional \{GPS\} data produces a positive stress change on the 2003 rupture. As a result of our examination of the stressing history of the Bingol hypocentre we argue that it is through a combination of historical seismology, guided and constrained by structural geology, directed paleoseismology in which the locations and extent of historical events are confirmed, and stress modelling which has been informed by detailed \{GPS\} data, that an integrated seismic hazard program might have the best chance of success.}}

Secondly, two series of simple quaternary ammonium surfactants were used. The cationic surfactant–DNA complex monolayers were formed at the air–water interface through the electrostatic interaction between the ammonium groups of the surfactants and the phosphate groups of \{DNA\} at the air–water interface. Combining the results of π–A isotherms, π–t isotherms, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, it was found that the surfactant molecular structures affect the surface properties and morphologies of 2D surfactant–DNA complexes. We expect that the study of the properties of 2D surfactant–DNA complexes will help us to understand the physicochemical properties of surfactant–DNA complexes, which are important for gene delivery.}}

In higher eukaryotes, phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (MLC) of myosin \{II\} is a primary means of activating myosin \{II\} and is known to be crucial for the execution of cell division. Because signals transmitted by the mitotic spindle coordinate key spatial and temporal aspects of cytokinesis, such signals should ultimately function to activate myosin II. Thus, it follows that identification of regulatory factors involved in \{MLC\} phosphorylation should elucidate the nature of spindle-derived regulatory signals and lead to a model for how they control cytokinesis. However, the identity of these upstream molecules remains elusive. This review (which is part of the Cytokinesis series) summarizes current views of the regulatory pathway controlling \{MLC\} phosphorylation and features four candidate molecules that are likely immediate upstream myosin regulators. I discuss proposed functions for MLCK, ROCK, citron kinase and myosin phosphatase during cytokinesis and consider the possibility of a link between these molecules and the signals transmitted by the mitotic spindle.}}

Many Erp proteins have been demonstrated to bind the host complement regulator factor H, and may thereby help protect the bacteria from complement-mediated killing during mammalian infection. Consistent with that hypothesis, all Erp proteins are produced by Borrelia burgdorferi during transmission between tick vectors and mammalian hosts. The present study examined whether erp genes are also expressed by B. burgdorferi following establishment of mammalian infection. To that end, quantitative RT-PCR was utilized to assess erp transcription levels within different tissues of infected non-human primates, a model that closely mimics human Lyme disease. The majority of erp genes were detectably transcribed after more than 3 months of mammalian infection. Intriguingly, differences in expression levels were noted among the various erp loci. No significant differences in erp expression were apparent between examined tissues, which included central and peripheral nervous system tissue, skeletal muscle, bladder, skin and heart tissues. These data strongly suggest that Erp proteins are expressed by B. burgdorferi throughout infection of their vertebrate hosts.}}

Using whole-cell \{EPSC\} recordings in the brain slices of young rats, we demonstrated that the pairing protocols of low frequency stimulation (LFS) at 3 Hz and postsynaptic depolarization of −50 mV elicited a reliable \{LTD\} in the subiculum. The \{LTD\} did not cause the changes of the paired-pulse ratio of EPSC. Furthermore, it did not depend on either \{NMDA\} receptors or voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Bath application of the G-protein coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) antagonists, atropine or scopolamine, blocked the LTD, suggesting that mAChRs are involved in the LTD.

In the case of random networks the mean Derrida plot can be obtained from the mean spectrum of the functions. The method is applied to real data by using the Boolean functions found in genetic regulatory networks of eukaryotic cells in an earlier study. Conventionally, Derrida plots and stability analysis have been computed with statistical sampling resulting in poorer accuracy.}}

abstract = {Induction of apoptosis is an essential function of p53 as a tumor suppressor. p53 can activate its downstream targets in a sequence specific manner to induce apoptosis. Most tumor derived p53 mutants are deficient in transcription activation as well as apoptosis induction. p53 can activate genes in the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways through transcription-dependent mechanisms or induce apoptosis through transcription-independent mechanisms. Several proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, such as \{PUMA\} and Noxa, are shown to be critical mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis. The selective activation of the apoptotic targets of p53 is modulated by transcription coactivators. The induction of apoptotic genes alone sometimes is not sufficient to induce apoptosis, as the cell cycle arrest mediated by the cell cycle inhibitors dominates apoptosis. Preventing the induction of p21 under these conditions can drive the cells towards apoptosis. Understanding how p53 controls apoptosis through its targets may lead to discoveries of novel therapeutics to combat cancer and other diseases.}}

In plants, five different classes can be distinguished, according to the number and the position of conserved catalytic cysteines. Four classes are defined as peroxiredoxins and were already identified by phylogenetic sequence analysis, 1-Cys, 2-Cys, type II, and type Q peroxiredoxins, and the fifth is represented by glutathione peroxidases, which were recently shown to possess a thioredoxin-dependent activity in plants. Since the discovery of peroxiredoxins in plants in 1996, a lot of work has been devoted to the biochemical and functional characterization of the different peroxiredoxin isoforms, but in contrast, few structural data are available. The analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome indicates that at least 17 isoforms of thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases are expressed in various plant compartments. The role of these proteins is discussed in terms of electron donor and substrate specificities and in light of their expression and localization. These enzymes are expressed in many plant tissues and are involved notably in the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus, in the response to various biotic or abiotic stresses by fighting reactive oxygen or nitrogen species and lipid peroxidation.}}

The offset effects can be compensated either by correcting results with a proper coefficient, or using 90° composite 13C pulses in the pulse sequence.

However, autofluorescence bronchoscopy has difficulty distinguishing between preinvasive lesions and other benign epithelial changes. A new autofluorescence imaging bronchovideoscope system (AFI) comprises three signals, including an autofluorescence (460–690 nm) on excitation blue light (395–445 nm) and two different bands of reflected light: G′ (550 nm) and R′ (610 nm). We hypothesized that color analyses of these three wave lengths would improve our ability to differentiate between inflammation and preinvasive lesions. In order to prove this hypothesis and to evaluate the efficacy of \{AFI\} for detecting preinvasive lesions, we conducted a prospective study. A total of 32 patients with suspected or known lung cancer were entered into this study. Conventional white light bronchovideoscopy (WLB) and light induced fluorescence endoscopy (LIFE) were performed prior to using AFI. \{WLB\} and \{LIFE\} detected 62 lesions, including lung cancers (n = 2), squamous dysplasias (n = 30), and bronchitis (n = 30). By utilizing AFI, 24 dysplasias and 2 cancer lesions were magenta in color, while 25 bronchitis lesions were blue. The sensitivities of detecting dysplasia by \{LIFE\} and \{AFI\} were 96.7% and 80%, respectively. The specificity of \{AFI\} (83.3%) was significantly higher than that of \{LIFE\} (36.6%) (p = 0.0005). We conclude that \{AFI\} appears to represent a significant advance in distinguishing preinvasive and malignant lesions from bronchitis or hyperplasia under circumstances where \{LIFE\} would identify these all as abnormal lesions.}}

Although these tremors are strictly connected with human activity, they differ considerably from other paraseismic vibrations.

The main problem discussed in the paper was formulated as the neural network evaluation of a relation between mining tremor energies, epicentral distances and acceleration response spectra. Back-propagation neural networks with Resilient back-propagation learning method were used. Each input vector included information about the mining tremor energy and the epicentral distance. Values of acceleration response spectrum were expected as the outputs of neural networks. Neurally evaluated spectra were compared with spectra computed on the basis of experimental data. After the network is trained and tested, it can be used for mapping of new data of mining tremor energies and epicentral distances into the spectra. Then, what is the substantial advantage of neural approach, the prediction of acceleration response spectra can be performed without recording of surface vibrations. In the light of the results, it is visible that the presented way of computation of acceleration response spectra can be peculiarly applied to prognosis of mining tremors influences on structures.}}

Methods A list of 226 pains was gathered from a convenience sample of persons on the street and patients waiting at medical and orthopedic clinics. These pains were ranked according to severity by health professionals and 19 pains with the most stable rankings were selected. These 19 pains were then rated by a sample of community-dwelling persons and a method of \{VAS\} standardization was developed, based on six selected pains. Results Individual variations in pain ratings were found to be independent of respondent age and gender, but were correlated with experience of the event or behavior and with self-reported health status. A new scoring method that takes into account these correlations is proposed. Conclusion It is possible to standardize \{VAS\} pain ratings to compare pain between different populations.}}

Several configurations were evaluated while developing the optimal \{ANN\} model. The optimal \{ANN\} model consisted of two hidden layers with two neurons in each hidden layer. This model was able to predict viscosity with a mean absolute error of 3.78 mPa s. The performance of the \{ANN\} was checked using experimental data.

Conflicting data from intervention studies with β-carotene to prevent cancers and cardiovascular disorders have challenged the concept. However, there is convincing evidence that carotenoids are important components of the antioxidant network. Photooxidative damage is suggested to be involved in the pathobiochemistry of several diseases affecting the skin and the eye, and carotenoids may protect light-exposed tissues. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the predominant carotenoids of the retina and are considered to act as photoprotectants preventing retinal degeneration. The unique distribution, localization and high levels of both carotenoids within the macula lutea as well as their physicochemical properties make them suitable candidates for photoprotection. β-Carotene is used as an oral sun protectant for the prevention of sunburn and has been shown to be effective either alone or in combination with other carotenoids or antioxidant vitamins.

Northern blot hybridizations of the lipoma cell line Li-14 revealed the expression of five additional \{HMGA2\} transcripts consisting of exons 1 to 3 but not exons 4 to 5 besides the full-length \{HMGA2a\} transcript. In silico analyses have been performed showing a high homology to well-established consensus sequences for the 3′ splice acceptor site, the branch site, and poly(A) signal.

In this study, we investigate the involvement of macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), one of the \{CC\} chemokines in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced liver injury in mice. Methods: Liver injury was induced by intravenous injection of Con A. Anti-mouse MIP-1α antibody, recombinant murine-MIP-1α and gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) were administrated prior to Con A injection. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), MIP-1α, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels were determined and histological assessment of the liver was performed. Results: Plasma MIP-1α level was elevated after Con A injection. The elevated plasma \{ALT\} level, mortality rate and histological change after Con A injection were inhibited by anti-MIP-1α antibody pretreatment. The elevated plasma \{ALT\} level after Con A injection was further enhanced by recombinant murine-MIP-1α. The elevated plasma TNF-α and IFN-γ levels after Con A injection were inhibited by anti-MIP-1α antibody, and enhanced by recombinant murine-MIP-1α. GdCl3 pretreatment inhibited the elevated plasma MIP-1α and \{ALT\} levels. Conclusions: These findings suggest that MIP-1α is produced from Kupffer cells after Con A injection, and this \{CC\} chemokine plays a crucial role in Con A-induced liver injury through induction of proinflammatory cytokines.}}

Although functional neuroimaging studies highlight the cortical brain regions associated with a specific cognitive task like reading, they do not directly address the underlying neural connections necessary for efficient performance of this task. Adults with reading disability have demonstrated lower regional white matter connectivity, but it is not known whether this relationship between neuronal wiring and reading performance also holds in younger readers. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) that highlights the structural integrity of the brain wiring, we show that regional brain connectivity in the left temporo-parietal white matter correlates with a wide range of reading ability in children as young as 8–12 years old. Diffusion tensor tractography suggests that the posterior limb of the internal capsule is consistent with the location of the largest cluster of correlation between reading ability (Word Identification subtest) and fractional anisotropy. The maturation of the white matter may play a key role in the development of cognitive processes such as reading.}}

The rate of surface change depends on the bone implantation site and the nacre/bone interaction. The in vivo biodegradability of nacre is a highly variable parameter. The size and shape of the implanted nacre and the cellular environment of the implant are key factors in determining the biodegradation kinetics of the nacre in a living system.}}

Acid secretion studies were undertaken using pylorus-ligated rats pretreated with menadione (5–45 mg/kg, i.p.). The effect of orally administered menadione on ethanol-induced gastric ulcers was also examined. The level of gastric wall mucus, non-protein sulfhydryls (NP-SH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured in the glandular stomach of rats following ethanol-induced gastric lesions. There was a significant inhibition of gastric acid secretion in the menadione treated rats. Pretreatment of rats with menadione significantly protected gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced gastric lesion. A significant attenuation of ethanol-induced reduction of gastric wall mucus, depletion of NP-SH and increase in gastric \{MPO\} activity was also observed in menadione treated rats. In conclusion, this study clearly showed acid antisecretory and antiulcer activity of menadione. Further studies are warranted to determine the mechanism of antiacid and gastroprotective effect of menadione.}}

Although the extrahepatic cellular tropism of \{HCV\} may play a role in the pathophysiology of this infection, the precise biological significance of the presence of \{HCV\} components in different liver cell types presently remains to be established. In this study, \{HCcAg\} was detected in nonparenchymal liver cells of six patients out of eight positive for serum \{HCV\} RNA. Immunostaining with anti-HCcAg mAbs revealed the presence of this protein in different liver cell types such as lymphocytes, Kupffer, polymorphonuclear, pit, endothelial, stellate, and fibroblast-like cells. Interestingly, \{HCcAg\} was immunolabeled not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus of these cells. Remarkably, \{HCcAg\} co-localized with large lipid droplets present in stellate cells and with collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix. Moreover, \{HCcAg\} was immunolabeled in bile canaliculus suggesting the involvement of the biliary system in the pathobiology of HCV. Data suggest that nonparenchymal liver cells may constitute a reservoir for \{HCV\} replication. Besides, \{HCcAg\} may contribute to modulate immune function and fibrosis in the liver as well as steatosis.}}

In this study, we replaced shorter C-terminal sequences of hC3 by corresponding \{CVF\} sequences to further reduce potential immunogenicity and to identify domains essential for the formation of functionally stable \{C3\} convertases. In one of these derivatives that is still capable of obliterating functional complement in vitro, the non-human portion could be reduced to a small domain located in the C-terminus of different complement proteins. This conserved NTR/C345C motif is known to be involved in assembly of different convertases of the complement system. These results suggest a major role of the \{C345C\} domain in the regulation of the half-life of the \{C3\} convertase. Moreover, its overall identity of 96% to human \{C3\} renders this derivative a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention in complement-mediated pathologies.}}

The reactants were silicate anions, metakaolin and aqueous alkali. Silicate anions from various sources, such as sodium orthosilicate (Na4SiO4) and two types of sodium silicate solutions (2SiO2·Na2O and 4SiO2·Na2O) were investigated. Further, silicate anions formed from the reaction of colloidal silica and aqueous alkali was also studied as a source for silicate anions. Interaction of silicate anions with Al sites of metakaolin soon after the mixing was obvious as 29Si MAS-NMR resonance lines of silicate anions were shifted to less shielded values. As the reaction progressed, the coordination of Al (IV, V, VI) in metakaolin changed almost completely to IV.

This last component is designed to discover connections between factors in the environment and the outbreak, but is often limited, either by time and resources, or the expertise of the personnel included in outbreak investigation teams. A waterborne Norovirus outbreak investigation in Sheridan County, Wyoming, in 2001 provides an excellent example of the importance of including an in-depth, systems-based environmental health assessment in outbreak investigations. The epidemiologic component of this investigation identified the water supply of a snowmobile lodge in the Bighorn Mountains as the source of the outbreak, a result that was confirmed by laboratory analysis. Including a systems-based environmental health assessment in this investigation also helped to uncover the underlying environmental factors that led to contamination of the water supply. Those factors included an onsite wastewater disposal system that was overloaded by increased use and not well suited to local soil and geologic conditions and a drinking water system with no treatment or disinfection. In addition, heavy precipitation and increased pumping of wells to satisfy higher demands probably facilitated the contamination of the drinking water wells by causing greater movement of wastewater through the soil and underlying bedrock. By focusing on these links between factors in the environment and adverse health outcomes, the systems-based environmental health assessment also helped to highlight prevention strategies for avoiding recurrences.}}

This and the success stories of multi-target drugs and combinatorial therapies led us to suggest that systematic drug-design strategies should be directed against multiple targets. We propose that the final effect of partial, but multiple, drug actions might often surpass that of complete drug action at a single target. The future success of this novel drug-design paradigm will depend not only on a new generation of computer models to identify the correct multiple targets and their multi-fitting, low-affinity drug candidates but also on more-efficient in vivo testing.}}

Sixteen data sets were used to train the \{ANN\} models and two data sets for the validation. Good correlations were obtained between the observed and predicted release profiles for the two randomly selected validation data sets. The difference factor (f1) and similarity factor (f2) between the \{ANN\} predicted and the observed release profiles indicated good performance of the \{ANN\} models. The established models were then applied to predict release kinetics of Dox from the microspheres of various initial loadings in media of different ionic strengths and NaCl/CaCl2 ratios.

Results: Assessing first the impact of Daxx expression on the rate of proliferation we demonstrate that overexpression of Daxx alone is not sufficient to alter proliferation in neoplastic lymphocytes. Nevertheless, expression of Daxx down-regulates anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and up-regulates pro-apoptotic BID. In addition, Daxx-overexpressing Jurkat cells exhibit a decreased expression of the pro-caspase-8, -10, -9 and -3 and a concomitant increase of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins survivin, XIAP, cIAP-1 and -2. We further demonstrate, that upon incubation with various chemotherapeutic agents these Daxx-induced molecular alterations sensitize Jurkat T-cells to the apoptosis-inducing effects of specific chemotherapeutic agents. Conclusions: We here outline the molecular changes elicited by Daxx on major components of the apoptotic cascade of malignant lymphocytes and demonstrate the capacity of Daxx to sensitize these cells to the apoptosis-inducing effect of various chemotherapeutic agents.}}

One of its ultimate goals is to provide an understanding of the complete set of molecular mechanisms describing an organism. Although this goal is a long way off, many useful insights can already come from currently available information and technology. One of the biggest challenges in drug discovery today is the high attrition rate: many promising candidates prove ineffective or toxic owing to a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms of biological systems they target. A “systems” approach can help identify pathways related to a disease and can suggest secondary effects of drugs that might cause these problems and thus ultimately improve the drug discovery pipeline.}}

Maintenance of such an organization is thus crucial to preserve cellular identity. At each cell cycle, during S phase, this is achieved by duplication of chromatin structure in tight coordination with \{DNA\} replication. Such a coordinate process requires histone synthesis and their deposition onto \{DNA\} by chromatin assembly factors to be efficiently coupled to \{DNA\} synthesis. In this review, we highlight the intimate relationship between these chromatin-related events and \{DNA\} replication and we show how it is possible to take advantage of this coupling in order to identify cells with high replicative potential such as tumor cells. On the basis of recent data, we discuss the potential use of chromatin-associated factors as new proliferation markers of interest for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.}}

Three examples from our research are used to illustrate how such selectivity can be tuned by changing the nature of the catalyst, by altering specific molecular features of the reactants, and/or by tuning the reaction conditions. Our discussion starts with the role of regiospecificity in dehydrogenation steps from adsorbed hydrocarbon intermediates in reforming, by showing how β-hydride elimination can explain hydrogenation, double bond migration and cis–trans isomerization in olefins. Next, the role of similar dehydrogenation steps in partial oxidations is illustrated by an example where atomic substitutions within the reactants can tip the balance between β- and γ-hydride elimination rates, and with that the selectivity between dehydrogenation and dehydration products from alcohols. Finally, the use of cinchona chiral modifiers to impart enantioselectivity to platinum hydrogenation catalysts is explained, and the role that reaction conditions such as concentrations, dissolved gases, and the nature of the solvent play in defining the performance of those systems is interpreted by using a molecular picture of the adsorption of the modifier.}}

The severity of these reactions to snakebite depends on the degree of envenomation. Lachesis muta venom (LMV) has weak lethal activity, but due to the large amount often inoculated, the effects are extremely severe and demand anti-venom with a high neutralizing capacity. \{LMV\} had the lowest neutralizing antibody induction capacity in horses when compared with that of other venoms. For example, Bothrops anti-venom serum neutralizes 180 times the equivalent \{LD50\} to Bothrops venom; Crotalus anti-venom neutralizes 250 \{LD50\} of this venom, while Lachesis anti-venom neutralizes only five \{LD50\} of the Lachesis toxins. To examine the reasons for this low antibody induction, the \{HGP\} mouse line, genetically selected for high antibody production received, at different times during immunization with sheep erythrocytes (SE), whole \{LMV\} and isolated venom fractions I–VI eluted by gel-filtration chromatography on Superdex®75. The specific antibody responsiveness showed a partial, but significant suppression of the anti-SE antibody responses during the kinetics of the primary and even the secondary immunizations, after 50–100 μg of fractions \{IV\} and V administration 72–48 h before the first antigen injections. Fraction \{IV\} was then applied in a Superose®12 column and three samples were obtained. The peak \{IVA\} containing a component of Mr 27 kDa was liable with the immunosuppressive effect as made evident by its effect on the H mice anti-SE responses. Horses receiving the \{LMV\} exempt of fractions \{IV\} and V produce highly significant anti-Lachesis sera with a 45 \{LD50\} neutralizing activity, providing, for the first time, an efficient specific therapeutic heterologous serum for human use.}}

We have investigated phylogenies of three families of ancient eukaryotic transcription factors for which fairly reliable interaction data are available. For all three families, bZIP, bHLH and \{NR\} (nuclear receptors), we find that homo-dimerising proteins were probably the ancestors and that series of single gene duplications, in combination with domain-rearrangements, were the main driving force in establishing the basic network architecture. However, the overall scaling behaviour does not always precisely confer to some theoretical models on network evolution. In conclusion, new models which reflect the biological details of molecular evolution, need to be developed.}}

The activity of methanogenic bacteria in the sludge was repressed by pH-control at 5.0 under anaerobic conditions. For efficient continuous hydrogen production, two immobilization methods were employed, biofilm formation on poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) and granulation of the sludge with cationic and anionic polymers. Acetic acid was the dominant fatty acid in the early operation stage in both cases. In the case of the biofilm, biogas production at 20 h hydraulic retention time was severely repressed to around 50 ml/L-reactor/h when propionic acid was sharply increased after 20 days of operation. In the case of granular sludge, propionic acid was produced only during the early operation stage and the biogas production rate was maintained at around 300 ml/L-reactor/h at 20 h of hydraulic retention time. The hydrogen gas content in the biogas was in the range of 40–60% and no methane was detected either case. Since granular sludge harboured more microorganisms and its density was higher than the biofilm on \{PVA\} medium, granulation was considered to be a better method for continuous hydrogen gas production.}}

Such studies have shown overlapping activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula stretching into the orbitofrontal cortex. Because the \{ACC\} is involved in top-down attentional regulation, this region may mediate the interaction between higher cognitive processes and the endogenous opioid network. Moreover, data also indicate that the \{ACC\} may exert its modulation through the brainstem opioid network. The orbitofrontal cortex also shows placebo-dependent activation, but it does not have similar access to the opioid network. Thus, this region may be involved in other aspects of the placebo response such as processing treatment expectations.}}

Using \{DNA\} fragmentation assay and nuclear staining assay, it showed that luteolin induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Luteolin induced the cytosolic release of cytochrome c and activated CPP32. We found that Bax and Bak translocated to mitochondria apparently, whereas Fas ligand (FasL) was unchanged after a treatment with luteolin for 3 h. In addition, it showed that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated after the treatment of luteolin for 3–12 h. Further investigation showed that a specific \{JNK\} inhibitor, SP600125, reduced the activation of \{CPP\} 32, the mitochondrial translocation of Bax, as well as the cytosolic release of cytochrome c that induced by luteolin. Finally, the apoptosis induced by luteolin was suppressed by a pretreatment with \{SP600125\} via evaluating annexin V-FITC binding assay.

Intervention(s) Ultrasonic evaluation and endometrial biopsy in luteal phase. Main outcome measure(s) Uterine artery Doppler, count of uterine \{CD56\} bright cells/field, and quantification by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to monitor IL-12 family (IL-12p40, IL-12p35, EBI3, IL-23), the IL-18 system (IL-18, IL-18R, IL18BP), and the IL-15 mRNA ratio. Result(s) The uterine artery Doppler and the \{CD56\} bright cell counts were significantly different in fertile and infertile patients. The mean uterine artery pulsatility index correlated significantly negatively with the IL-18/actin ratio suggesting a defect of the cytokine-dependent vascular remodeling pathway. The number of uterine \{CD56\} bright cells was significantly correlated with the IL-15/actin and IL-18/IL-18BP ratios. Thus, IL-18 and IL-15 seems to be involved in the local recruitment and the activation of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells. IL-18 was itself correlated with IL-15 and IL-12, suggesting a local control of uNK cells activation. Conclusion(s) The assessment of the tripod IL-12/-15/-18 shows distinct immune-related mechanisms that are involved in the broader context of inadequate uterine receptivity.}}

We also looked at the effects of some bile acids on the coordination of intercellular calcium oscillations. Methods The permeability of gap junctions was assessed by fluorescent dye transfer and calcium signalling on fluorescent microscopy. Results Cholestatic bile acids such as taurolithocholate, taurolithocholate-sulfate and taurochenodeoxycholate inhibit the permeability of gap junctions in a dose-dependent and reversible manner in hepatocytes. Experiments performed in other cell types suggest that this effect is specific for cells having bile salt transporters, independently of the type of connexin expressed in these cells. Thus, cholestatic bile acids inhibit \{PGJC\} in normal rat cholangiocytes which express Cx43, but not in HeLa cells transfected with Cx26 or 32, which are expressed in hepatocytes. Calcium oscillations induced by bile acids in rat hepatocyte couplets are not coordinated and, by inhibiting the PGJC, cholestatic bile acids prevent the coordination of calcium oscillations induced by noradrenaline in these cells. Conclusions Cholestatic, but not choleretic bile acids inhibit the \{PGJC\} in cells able to accumulate bile acids. This inhibition might contribute to the cholestatic effect of these bile acids.}}

abstract = {The steroid/thyroid hormone receptors are members of a very large family of nuclear-activated transcription factors. These receptors play a crucial role in most biological function, including regulation of development, metabolism, behaviour and reproduction. Among androgen receptor (AR), we have recently demonstrated that its expression in the Harderian gland (HG) of the male hamster is under a well-co-ordinated cross-talk between various steroid hormone receptors. Here, are presented data on the sequence of hamster \{AR\} promoter region (5′UTR) and the molecular tools of its regulation. The 5′UTR is 1585 bp. The promoter region shows various responsive elements. Two putative \{CREM\} elements are present at −71 and −1576 bp. A putative retinoic acid responsive element is present at −1476 bp. An androgen/glucocorticoid responsive element is present at −473 bp. A putative thyroid hormone-responsive element at −381 bp and an estrogen responsive element at −230 bp. Also, a homopurinic stretch is evident between −1199 and −1118. Furthermore, Sp1 sites are also spread along the sequence. As well as for human, mouse, rat and pig, the hamster lacks the canonical promoter \{TATA\} and \{CCAAT\} boxes. Gel retardation experiments confirm the presence of active responsive elements for AR, estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor. Previous data on the regulation of expression of \{AR\} by other members of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors well correlate with sequence analysis and gel retardation experiments. Thus, androgens, thyroid hormone, stimulate the \{AR\} transcription, while synthetic glucocorticoid (Dex) and estrogen are potent inhibitors of \{AR\} expression. The comparison of hamster \{AR\} promoter sequence with other \{AR\} promoter shows an 89, 82, 84 and 84% identity with human, rat, mouse and pig \{AR\} promoter, respectively. These results, in the light of the extreme plasticity of hamster HG, suggest that the comparative study of expression and regulation of \{AR\} gene in the \{HG\} of the hamster offers a useful tool to approach the normal and pathological phenotype in human.}}

In multiple linear regression analyses concerning control subjects, family disposition, social class, a score based on serum triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, and fasting capillary blood glucose concentration were significantly associated with plasma fibrinogen concentration (P &lt; .00005, \{R2\} = 0.81). For case subjects, the ratio between serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations was significantly associated with plasma fibrinogen concentration (P = .0018, \{R2\} = 0.39). Thus, for healthy subjects, 4 coronary risk factors explained three quarters of the variation of plasma fibrinogen concentration, and for patients with a previous acute myocardial infarction, another coronary risk factor explained one third of the variation. In conclusion, the pattern of coronary risk factors associated with plasma fibrinogen concentration differed between those without coronary heart disease and those with a previous acute myocardial infarction.}}

To this end, the IGF-I and \{PRL\} levels of African and Italian women still living in their countries of origin were determined. The IGF-I levels of African women turned out to be lower than those of Italian women (11.53 ± 8.67 vs 29.16 ± 14.39 ng/mL) and, in addition, decreased significantly and progressively within the first 3 days after delivery. The IGF-I levels in the colostrums of Italian women who delivered by cesarean delivery were comparable to that of African women who delivered by spontaneous delivery. However, because the colostrum volume and the IGF-I level of African women are larger and lower, respectively, than those typical of Italian women, Italian and African newborns end up receiving roughly the same amount of IGF-I on day 1 after birth. Prolactin levels in Italian and African women were comparable (85.16 ± 29.14 and 74.88 ± 27.97 ng/mL) and were significantly reduced in 10 Italian women 2 days after the cesarean delivery (59.22 ± 12.96 ng/mL). The progressive decrease of IGF-I level detected in the first 3 days of life demonstrates the crucial role of IGF-I in the development of both gastrointestinal and immune systems. In addition, the stability of \{PRL\} levels in the first 3 days of life underlines the essential role of this hormone in the switching on of lactation as well as in the regulation of immune response.}}

To quantify and predict fungal nitrogen redistribution, and assess the importance of the integrity of fungal networks in soil for ecosystem function, we need better understanding of the structures and processes involved. Until recently nitrogen translocation has been experimentally intractable owing to the lack of a suitable radioisotope tracer for nitrogen, and the impossibility of observing nitrogen translocation in real time under realistic conditions. We have developed an imaging method for recording the magnitude and direction of amino acid flow through the whole mycelial network as it captures, assimilates and channels its carbon and nitrogen resources, while growing in realistically heterogeneous soil microcosms. Computer analysis and modeling, based on these digitized video records, can reveal patterns in transport that suggest experimentally testable hypotheses. Experimental approaches that we are developing include genomics and stable isotope \{NMR\} to investigate where in the system nitrogen compounds are being acquired and stored, and where they are mobilized for transport or broken down. The results are elucidating the interplay between environment, metabolism, and the development and function of transport networks as mycelium forages in soil. The highly adapted and selected foraging networks of fungi may illuminate fundamental principles applicable to other supply networks.}}

Methods: The expression of \{CXCL8\} receptors \{CXCR1\} and \{CXCR2\} was assessed by RT-PCR and \{FACS\} analysis in human Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. The effects of \{CXCL8\} on intestinal epithelial proliferation were assessed with colorimetric \{MTT\} assays and the effects on epithelial restitution with an in vitro migration model using Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Results: While the expression of both \{CXCR1\} mRNA and protein could be demonstrated by RT-PCR and \{FACS\} analysis in human Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, no expression of \{CXCR2\} was observed in these cell lines. Colorimetric \{MTT\} assays revealed that \{CXCL8\} does not modulate cell proliferation in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. In contrast, \{CXCL8\} significantly enhanced intestinal epithelial migration in an in vitro migration model of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. Enhancement of intestinal epithelial cell migration by \{CXCL8\} was partially CXCR1-dependent and TGFβ-independent. Conclusion: \{CXCL8\} exerts functional effects on intestinal epithelial cells that may be relevant for intestinal inflammation and mucosal healing.}}

Different mutations in the insulin signaling pathway and caloric restriction have been shown to retard aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. In addition, mutations or \{RNAi\} silencing of components of the respiratory chain results in the modification of adult life span. Another class of genes that affect life span in C. elegans is the clock (clk) genes. Particularly interesting is clk-1, which encodes an enzyme required for ubiquinone (coenzyme Q, CoQ) biosynthesis. Down-regulation by \{RNAi\} silencing of the genes required for ubiquinone biosynthesis also extends life span in C. elegans, and CoQ supplied in the diet also affects nematode longevity in both clk-1 and wild-type strains. Although there are many aspects that can be considered in aging, we focus this review on the role of CoQ in the longevity of C. elegans. We will review the current information about the biosynthesis of CoQ and its dietary supplementation related to the extension of life span. We will also analyze the function of CoQ in the electron transport chain and reactive oxygen species production in the context of aging. We hypothesize that the role of CoQ on longevity of C. elegans supports the oxidative damage theory of aging.}}

However, the long-term survival is limited by the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome occurs in more than half of lung transplant recipients who survive more than 5 years and is the leading cause of death in the late posttransplantation period. The specific etiology and pathogenesis of \{BOS\} are not well understood. The current premise is that \{BOS\} represents a common lesion in which different inflammatory insults such as ischemia-reperfusion, rejection, and infection can lead to a similar histological and clinical outcome. However, the observation that early development of \{BOS\} is predicted by the frequency and severity of acute rejection episodes indicates that alloimmune-dependent mechanisms play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of BOS. The evidence presented in this review will demonstrate that \{BOS\} is the result of indolent humoral immune responses developed against major histocompatibility complex molecules expressed by airway epithelial cells of the lung allograft. Currently, treatment of \{BOS\} is rarely successful. Therefore, a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of \{BOS\} is of paramount importance toward improving long-term graft function and patient survival after lung transplantation.}}

Combinations of different analytical platforms are therefore required for comprehensive metabolomic studies. Each of these platforms covers only part of the metabolome. To establish multiparallel technologies, thorough standardization of each measured metabolite is required. Standardization is best achieved by addition of a specific stable isotope-labeled compound, a mass isotopomer, for each metabolite. This suggestion, at first glance, seems unrealistic because of cost and time constraints. A possible solution to this problem is discussed in this article. Saturation in vivo labeling with stable isotopes enables the biosynthesis of differentially mass-labeled metabolite mixtures, which can be exploited for highly standardized metabolite profiling by mass isotopomer ratios.}}

Presently, most telecom carriers use synchronous optical network/synchronous digital hierarchy (SONET/SDH) equipment to “aggregate” data traffic in the metropolitan area network (MAN) before accessing the Internet backbone network. Because of the intrinsic limitations of SONET/SDH equipment in transporting data traffic, especially in terms of bandwidth scalability and provisioning efficiency, there is a need to find a broadband access solution that can overcome the drawbacks of SONET/SDH.

The transalkylation activity of the catalysts and the selectivity to xylenes was increased by platinum and this effect was stronger in the PtMor and in PtY zeolite, respectively.

abstract = {Colonies of the ant Temnothorax (formerly Leptothorax) albipennis can collectively choose the best of several nest sites, even when many of the active ants who organize the move visit only one site. Previous studies have suggested that this ability stems from the ants' strategy of graded commitment to a potential home. On finding a site, an ant proceeds from independent assessment, to recruiting fellow active ants via slow tandem runs, to bringing the passive bulk of the colony via rapid transports. Assessment duration varies inversely with site quality, and the switch from tandem runs to transports requires that a quorum of ants first be summoned to the site. These rules may generate a collective decision, by creating and amplifying differential population growth rates among sites. We test the importance of these and other known behavioural rules by incorporating them into an agent-based model. All parameters governing individual behaviour were estimated from videotaped emigrations of individually marked ants given a single nest option of either good or mediocre quality. The time course of simulated emigrations and the distribution of behaviour across ants largely matched these observations, except for the speed with which the final transport phase was completed, and the overall emigration speed of one particularly large colony. The model also predicted the prevalence of splitting between sites when colonies had to choose between two sites of different quality, although it correctly predicted the degree of splitting in only four of six cases. It did not fully capture variance in colony performance, but it did predict the emergence of variation in individual behaviour, despite the use of identical parameter values for all ants. The model shows how, with adequate empirical data, the algorithmic form of a collective decision-making mechanism can be captured.}}

A direct application of the assumed modes method incorporating continuum modes as basis leads to difficulties. The source of this difficulty is identified. A method that uses inverse power iterations is proposed to pre-condition the assumed modes appropriately. The proposed method of using continuum modes as basis for model order reduction leads to substantial computational saving while maintaining good accuracy. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed procedure of using the continuum modes in conjunction with pre-conditioning.}}

abstract = {Mucosal surfaces are protected by a first line of defence termed the innate immune system, which controls the resident microflora to effectively prevent microbial diseases. Inflammatory processes are activated as a consequence of a complex interplay between microbes and host target cells. Many bacterial pathogens have developed mechanisms to avoid host recognition. Some are even able to exploit the immune response through sophisticated interactions with the host signalling cascades in order to increase their replication and propagation. While in the past major emphasis on bacterial protein toxins was directed towards their cytotoxic role, it is increasingly evident that toxins can also modulate various cellular functions at non-cytolytic concentrations. Here, we review important aspects on the molecular mechanisms of immunomodulatory interference by bacterial toxins, with emphasis on the signalling induced in the intestinal epithelium.}}

The results showed that mRNA levels of p53 and bax were increased in a dose-dependent manner and at the concentrations of 28.00 and 56.00 mg/m3 \{SO2\} the increases were significant (for p53: 1.23-fold at 28 mg/m3 and 1.39-fold at 56 mg/m3; for bax: 1.77-fold at 28 mg/m3 and 2.26-fold at 56 mg/m3, respectively), while mRNA levels of bcl-2 were decreased significantly (0.78-fold at 28 mg/m3 and 0.73-fold at 56 mg/m3) in lungs of rats exposed to SO2. Dose-dependent increase of p53 and bax proteins in the lungs was observed after \{SO2\} inhalation, while decrease of bcl-2 protein levels was obtained using immunohistochemistry method. Caspase-3 activities were increased in lungs of rats after \{SO2\} inhalation. These results lead to a conclusion that \{SO2\} exposure can change the expression of apoptosis-related genes, and it suggests that \{SO2\} can induce apoptosis in lung of rat and may have relations with some apoptosis-related diseases. Elucidating the expression patterns of those factors after \{SO2\} inhalation may be critical to our understanding mechanisms of \{SO2\} toxicity and helpful for the therapeutic intervention.}}

Analysing neurosphere explants on laminin and fibronectin as major β1 integrin ligands, the maximal spreading of outward migrating neuronal cells was determined. Compared with gelatine as a standard substrate, migration was found to be significantly increased for D3-derived neurospheres on fibronectin and laminin-1. These matrix effects were found to be even enhanced for \{G201\} preparations. In addition, also the differentiation of wild-type and β1 integrin −/− neurones – as determined by MAP-2- and HNK-1-immunoreactive processes – was found to be increased on fibronectin and laminin when compared to gelatine standards. In the respective knockout preparations on these matrices, again perturbation effects were less pronounced than on gelatine. Our observations indicate that laminin and fibronectin are involved both in β1 integrin-dependent and -independent signalling mechanisms during neurogenesis. Upregulation of compensatory mechanisms such as β1 integrin-independent receptors for laminin and fibronectin might be responsible for the much less pronounced perturbations of \{G201\} neural precursor migration and differentiation on these two substrates than on gelatine.}}

Experimental results on some real data sets are also provided to show the effectiveness of this approach versus the classical cross entropy (based on a global posterior probability estimation).}}

These approaches have been successful in demonstrating the huge number of genes that are differentially expressed in the murine and bovine mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy, lactation and involution.

We focus on the craniofacial complex because it exhibits a wide growth maturity gradient and is, therefore, ideally suited to test the hypothesis of differential response potential to the same stimulus across structures. Because it is a major epigenetic factor controlling somatic growth and maturation, emphasis is placed on studies pertaining to growth hormone (GH) deficits/supplementation. \{GH\} deficiency has profound effects on overall body size/maturation and it produces characteristic abnormalities in the craniofacial complex. Human and, especially, animal studies, show that (1) the various components of the craniofacial complex exhibit substantially different response potentials to hormonal deficits, (2) growth deficits associated with \{GH\} deficits are greatest for the most mature structures; less mature craniofacial structures display the greatest potential for future growth deficits, and (3) the less mature structures have the greater potential for catch-up following \{GH\} supplementation. We conclude that the craniofacial growth maturity gradient provides a basis for better understanding variability in response potential across craniofacial structures.}}

Mounting evidence suggests that this polysaccharide can be organized into a wide variety of molecular architectures by its association with specific binding proteins, leading to the formation of fibrils and cable-like structures involving a large number of hyaluronan chains. We propose that hyaluronan cross-linking is part of a protective mechanism, promoting adhesion of leukocytes to the hyaluronan complexes rather than enabling contact with inflammation-promoting receptors on the underlying tissues. Leukocytes are thus maintained in a non-activated state by appropriate receptor clustering or receptor co-engagement. Additionally, hyaluronan networks might serve as scaffolds to prevent the loss of extracellular matrix components during inflammation and to sequester proinflammatory mediators.}}

These models can be viewed as age of infection epidemic models and analyzed using the approach of the full Kermack–McKendrick model.

The purpose of the present study was to clarify which pro-inflammatory mediators are targeted by IL-1β in mice with DSS-induced colitis. First, we found that \{DSS\} markedly induced IL-1β production in both dose- and time-dependent manners (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) in murine peritoneal macrophages (pMϕ), while that of tumor necrosis factor-α was insignificant. Further, the expressions of mRNA and protein for IL-1β were increased in colonic mucosa and pMϕ from mice that received drinking water containing 5% \{DSS\} for 7 days (P &lt; 0.01, each). In addition, the expressions of IL-6, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA were also time dependently increased (P &lt; 0.01, each). Furthermore, administration of rIL-1β (10 μg/kg, i.p.) significantly induced the expressions of IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA in colonic mucosa from non-treated mice (P &lt; 0.01). Anti-mIL-1β antibody treatments (50 μg/kg, i.p.) attenuated DSS-induced body weight reduction and shortening of the colorectum (P &lt; 0.05, each), and abrogated the expressions of IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA in colonic mucosa (P &lt; 0.01, each). Our results evidently support the previous findings that IL-1β is involved in the development of DSS-induced experimental colitis in mice, and strongly suggest that IL-1β targets itself and IL-6 for progressing colonic inflammation.}}

As reported in different empirical studies based on insights from theories of consumer behavior, store atmosphere should evoke phasic arousal reactions to attract consumers. Most of these empirical investigations used verbal scales to measure consumers’ perceived phasic arousal at the point-of-sale (POS). However, the validity of verbal arousal measurement is questioned; self-reporting methods only allow a time-lagged measurement. Furthermore, the selection of inappropriate items to represent perceived arousal is criticized, and verbal reports require some form of cognitive evaluation of perceived arousal by the individual, who might (in a non-measurement condition) not even be aware of the arousal. By contrast, phasic electrodermal reaction (EDR) has proven to be the most appropriate and valid indicator for measuring arousal [W. Boucsein, Physiologische Grundlagen und Meßmethoden der dermalen Aktivität. In: F. Rösler (Ed.), Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, Bereich Psychophysiologie, Band 1: Grundlagen and Methoden der Psychophysiologie, Kapitel, Vol. 7, Hogrefe, Göttingen, 2001, pp. 551–623] that could be relevant to behavior. \{EDR\} can be recorded simultaneously to the perception of stimuli. Furthermore, telemetric online device can be used, which enables physiological arousal measurement while participants can move freely through the store and perform the assigned task in the experiments.

A Monte Carlo simulation model of dead-end filtration is used under the influences of hydrodynamic bias from the permeation flux as well as inter-particle interactions. The model effectively demonstrates the roles of the hydrodynamic drag force and inter-particle potential in governing the volume fraction of the particle deposit. The cake layer volume fraction is shown to be sensitive to the combination of particle surface (zeta) potential, solution ionic strength, particle size, and applied transmembrane pressure. Further application of the model leads to a holistic characterization of the phase transition phenomenon. The onset of phase transition is characterized with flexibility and adaptability with concern for both physico-chemical standards, such as volume fraction and inter-particle separation distance, as well as pragmatic considerations, such as the desire to operate the system below the critical flux and avoidance of irreversible cake formation.}}

VE-cadherin is absolutely required for vascular morphogenesis, but N-cadherin is thought to participate in vessel stabilization by interacting with periendothelial cells during vessel formation. However, recent data suggest a more critical role for N-cadherin in endothelium that would regulate angiogenesis, in part by controlling VE-cadherin expression. In this study, we have assessed N-cadherin function in vascular development using an in vitro model derived from embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation. We show that pluripotent \{ES\} cells genetically null for N-cadherin can differentiate normally into endothelial cells. In addition, sprouting angiogenesis was unaltered, suggesting that N-cadherin is not essential for the early events of angiogenesis. However, the lack of N-cadherin led to an impairment in pericyte covering of endothelial outgrowths.

The aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the expression levels of proteins of the \{IGF\} axis in prostate cancer. We studied expression of the ligands IGF-I and IGF-II, the inhibitory \{IGF\} binding protein–3, the type I \{IGF\} receptor (IGF-IR), and the downstream mediator insulin receptor substrate-1 by immunohistochemistry in 56 tissue specimens (28 low-grade and 28 high-grade prostate adenocarcinomas). Protein expression in tumor areas, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PINs), and adjacent benign prostatic tissue were evaluated regarding staining intensity and fraction of positive cells. An immunoreactivity score was established from staining intensity and fraction of positive cells, and correlated with the prognostic clinicopathologic parameters prostate-specific antigen serum levels, Gleason score, and \{TNM\} stage. The expression levels of all proteins investigated, except \{IGF\} binding protein–3, were up-regulated in \{PIN\} and in cancer. IGF-I and IGF-II expression showed a higher expression in high-grade compared with low-grade tumor areas. IGF-I and IGF-II and insulin receptor substrate-1 immunoreactivity was higher in tumors from patients with preoperative prostate-specific antigen serum levels 10 ng/mL or greater, and IGF-II expression was correlated with Gleason score. The data indicate significant alterations in the \{IGF\} system as prostate cancer develops. Differential expression of growth-stimulating components of the \{IGF\} system may be associated with the malignant phenotype and more aggressive tumor behavior. Expression of IGFs, especially IGF-II, may be predictors of the outcome of prostate cancer.}}

Concerning chemical coding, ultrastructure and neuronal circuits, it is more similar to the central than to the peripheral nervous system. Its networks, the myenteric and submucous plexus are integrated in the gut wall. The enteric nervous system is a system of high plasticity, which not only changes during pre- and postnatal development, but also with disease or changing dietary habits. The Aim of this study was to elucidate changes in protein expression during the first two postnatal weeks in the rat myenteric plexus. Colonic and duodenal myenteric plexus from newborn (P1) and fourteen-day old (P14) Sprague–Dawley rats was isolated following a procedure that combines enzymatic digestion and mechanical agitation. The neuronal tissue was collected and processed for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The obtained 2-D gels were stained with silver for image analysis or with colloidal Coomassie for subsequent protein identification. Gels from the various samples showed a high degree of consistence concerning protein-spots found in all preparations. Nevertheless, there was a number of proteins that were clearly detected in one sample but not, or only in significantly smaller amounts in the other. Several differentially expressed proteins in the postnatal myenteric plexus were identified with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Especially stathmin, polyubiquitin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein seem to play an important role in pre- and postnatal development. 2-DE combined with mass spectrometry can help to identify pathological relevant proteins in the enteric nervous system, and so deliver a valuable tool for the early diagnosis of also central nervous system diseases by using biopsies from the gut.}}

abstract = {The “Networked Economy” describes alliances of firms that manage globally distributed supply networks. In the best of all worlds, this interactive flow of information among member firms will result in efficient and effective balance of supply and demand. Unfortunately, supply networks suffer from poor and inexact information, and, in the worst case, information is unavailable where and when it is needed. Such entropy creates errors and limits responsiveness of processes leading to situations where there is too much or too little inventory at a given stage in a supply network. These complications are exacerbated across transnational supply chain networks. This paper offers theoretical perspectives, a case study, and outline of a research proposal to help address these challenges and develop insights into the best practices of transnational digital supply networks. High level questions include: What are the defining characteristics of high performing digital supply networks? How does information sharing impact the error and responsiveness of supply network processes and, consequently, supply network performance? How do international outsourcing practices affect network outcomes? These questions are theoretically examined and used to formulate specific hypotheses. An initial investigation of this theoretical formulation is conducted using a case study approach of a global plastics supply network. We propose a program of follow-up empirical work based on a broad field study of high performing supply networks. After a rigorous process for developing the instrumentation through semi-structured interviews, we expect to gather information about over 300 network configurations. As initial empirical evidence for going beyond dyadic exploration of supply networks, we present a case analysis of a plastic industry supply network, the Omnexus electronic trading network. In this analysis, we show how network externalities lead to more efficient flows of information and to more dynamic responses. The overall performance of all firms participating in this network should be enhanced over time. The major contribution of these ongoing studies will be new theoretical and empirical insights into the pathologies and metabolism of global digital supply networks. Specifically, we intend to delineate externalities of supply networks that are not embraced by exclusively dyadic perspectives, as well as the salient factors that complicate the interaction of supply network behavior across national boundaries. We will develop, test and measure novel constructs such as networked organizational performance and error amplification, unveiling systematic knowledge about the relationships between these factors across socio-geographic regions.}}

The Pearl River Estuary receives freshwater from eight major sources, each containing various pollutants. The spectral absorption and fluorescence properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Pearl River Estuary were studied during November 2002, a low flow (dry) season. Over a salinity range of 33–0, \{CDOM\} absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(355)) ranged from 0.24 to 1.93 m− 1, lower than several other American and European estuaries. In contrast to the wet season, conservative mixing was evidenced by a linear, inverse relationship between a(355) and salinity. CDOM, primarily of terrestrial origin, contained more anthropogenic organic matter than natural plant decay matter: tryptophan-like fluorophore T had the strongest signal among all fluorophores for the entire study region. The absorption spectral slope (S), determined between 300 and 500 nm, ranged between 0.0138 and 0.0184 nm− 1 and did not show distinguishable patterns except in the transition zone between the estuary and the South China Sea. The relative composition of fluorophores was found to vary among different sources. This result demonstrated the potential for using fluorophores to characterize the composition of \{CDOM\} and trace pollutants to their various freshwater sources.}}

Expression of mutant myotilin leads to sarcomeric alterations in the dominantly inherited limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1A and in myofibrillar myopathy/desmin-related myopathy. Together, with previous in vitro studies, this indicates that myotilin has an important function in the assembly and maintenance of Z-discs. This study characterises further the interaction between myotilin and actin. Functionally important regions in myotilin were identified by actin pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays and with a novel strategy that combines in vitro \{DNA\} transposition-based peptide insertion mutagenesis with phenotype analysis in yeast cells. The shortest fragment to bind actin was the second Ig domain together with a short C-terminal sequence. Concerted action of the first and second Ig domain was, however, necessary for the functional activity of myotilin, as verified by analysis of transposon mutants, actin binding and phenotypic effect in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the Ig domains flanked with N- and C-terminal regions were needed for actin-bundling, indicating that the mere actin-binding sequence was insufficient for the actin-regulating activity. None of the four known disease-associated mutations altered the actin-organising ability. These results, together with previous studies in titin and kettin, identify the Ig domain as an actin-binding unit.}}

Stimulation of \{MCF7\} cells with type \{IV\} collagen (Col-IV) promoted a striking increase in the phosphorylation of \{STAT5\} at Tyr-694, as revealed by site-specific antibodies that recognized the phosphorylated state of this residue.

We recently showed that the effects of the elicitor involve phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. Here, we show that the elicitor action on Aq production can be blocked with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM but not in a Ca2+-free medium (+EGTA) or in the presence of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel antagonists verapamil and nifedipine. In agreement with these observations, spectrofluorimetric measurements in Fura 2-loaded R. tinctorum cells show that chitosan increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a medium devoid of calcium. Short treatment intervals (1–5 min) of cells with the elicitor significantly increased \{DAG\} and \{IP3\} formation. Moreover, the PI-PLC inhibitors neomycin and \{U73122\} diminished to a great extent chitosan-induced Aq synthesis. Blockers of Ca2+ release from inner stores such as 2-APB, TMB-8, caffeine, ruthenium red and dantrolene inhibited elicitation. Chitosan rapidly stimulated (phosphorylated) MAPK. This effect was significantly decreased by the calcium modulators used above. However, \{EGTA\} did not prevent activation of MAPK. Compound LY24009, a blocker of PI3K, inhibited \{MAPK\} phosphorylation by chitosan. Accordingly, an increase in \{PI3K\} activity was observed in parallel. The results of this study show that chitosan induction of anthraquinone synthesis in R. tinctorum involves the stimulation of PLC, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and PI3K, which mediate \{MAPK\} activation.}}

Construction of a subtracted and normalized cDNA library efficiently eliminates common abundant cDNA messages and also increases the probability of identifying clones differentially expressed in low-abundance cDNA messages. We used this method to successfully isolate differentially expressed genes from Pennisetum seedlings in response to salinity stress. Sequence analysis of the selected clones showed homologies to genes that were reported previously and shown to be involved in plant stress adaptation.}}

Repression of E-cadherin by transcriptional regulators such as Snail or Twist emerges as one critical step driving EMT, and this stage is currently being molecularly linked with many of the new players.

Interstitial recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes and myofibroblasts occurs early in kidneys destined to develop fibrosis. Circulating monocytes are recruited by locally secreted chemoattractant molecules, facilitated by leukocyte adhesion molecules. Functionally heterogeneous macrophages secrete many fibrosis-promoting molecules, but under some circumstances they may also serve a protective scavenging role. Excessive extracellular matrix production occurs primarily within interstitial myofibroblasts, a population of cells that appears to have more than 1 origin, including the resident interstitial fibroblasts, transdifferentiated tubular epithelial cells, and bone marrow–derived cells. Impaired activity of the endogenous renal matrix-degrading proteases may enhance interstitial matrix accumulation, but the specific pathways that are involved remain unclear. Tubules, inflammatory cells, and myofibroblasts synthesize the molecules that activate the fibrogenic cascades, the most important of which is transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). TGF-β may direct cells to assume a profibrotic phenotype or it may do so indirectly after stimulating synthesis of other fibrogenic molecules such as connective tissue growth factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Reduced levels of antifibrotic factors that are normally produced in the kidney such as hepatocyte growth factor and bone morphogenic protein-7 may accelerate fibrosis and its destructive consequences. Development of new therapeutic agents for \{CKD\} looks promising, but several agents that target different components of the fibrogenic cascade will almost certainly be necessary.}}

The predominant three loci haplotype in Guiné-Bissau was A*2301-B*1503-DRB1*1101 (4.6%) and in Cabo Verde was A*3002-B*350101-DRB1*1001 (2.8%), exclusive to northwestern islands (5.6%) and absent in Guiné-Bissau. The present study corroborates historic sources and other genetic studies that say Cabo Verde were populated not only by Africans but also by Europeans. Haplotypes and dendrogram analysis shows a Caucasian genetic influence in today’s gene pool of Cabo Verdeans. Haplotypes and allele frequencies present a differential distribution between southeastern and northwestern Cabo Verde islands, which could be the result of different genetic influences, founder effect, or bottlenecks. Dendrograms and principal coordinates analysis show that Guineans are more similar to North Africans than other HLA-studied sub-Saharans, probably from ancient and recent genetic contacts with other peoples, namely East Africans.}}

We studied the effect of acute noise stress on nociception and the possible changes in the serotonergic and opioidergic systems in young mice of both sexes. Naloxone pre-treatment was also investigated. Noise stress was produced by a sound source, nociception was measured by the hot-plate test and binding characteristics were evaluated by a radioligand binding technique using membrane preparation from the total frontal cortex. Acute noise stress provoked an antinociceptive effect, associated with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels, a decrease in the number of 5-HT2 receptors in stressed male and female mice and a decrease in the number of μ receptors in both sexes. The behavioural and biochemical effects were antagonized by 1 mg/kg of naloxone. Acute noise stress behaves like other types of stress on nociception. The opioidergic system seems to be involved in this behaviour but also the serotonergic system may play a role. Sex differences were detected in the number of 5-HT2 and μ receptors between male and female mice not subjected to stress, while the percentage decrease in 5-HT2 and μ receptors did not differ significantly between the two sexes.}}

The underlying methodology involves mechanisms of genetic optimization, especially genetic algorithms (GAs). Let us recall that the design of the “conventional” \{FPNNs\} uses an extended Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and exploits a fixed fuzzy inference type located at each \{FPN\} of the \{FPNN\} as well as considers a fixed number of input nodes at \{FPNs\} (or nodes) located in each layer. The proposed \{FPNN\} gives rise to a structurally optimized structure and comes with a substantial level of flexibility in comparison to the one we encounter in conventional FPNNs. The structural optimization is realized via \{GAs\} whereas in the case of the parametric optimization we proceed with a standard least square method based learning. Through the consecutive process of such structural and parametric optimization, an optimized and flexible fuzzy neural network is generated in a dynamic fashion. The performance of the proposed gFPNN is quantified through experimentation that exploits standard data already being used in fuzzy modeling. The results reveal superiority of the proposed networks over the existing fuzzy and neural models.}}

Short-range interaction and limited dispersion allows for coexistence of competing species that cannot coexist in a well-mixed environment. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that destroy species diversity we study the intermediate situation of imperfect mixing, typical in aquatic media, in a model of cyclic competition between toxin producing, sensitive and resistant phenotypes. It is found, that chaotic mixing, by changing the character of the spatial distribution, induces coherent oscillations in the populations. The magnitude of the oscillations increases with the strength of mixing, leading to the extinction of some species beyond a critical mixing rate. When mixing is non-uniform in space, coexistence can be sustained at much stronger mixing by the formation of partially isolated regions, that prevent global extinction. The heterogeneity of mixing may enable toxin producing and sensitive strains to coexist for very long time at strong mixing.}}

This compound has affinity for mGluR5 in a nanomolar concentration range and seems to be superior to the earlier known antagonists in terms of its specificity and bioavailability. Catalepsy and muscle rigidity induced by haloperidol administered at doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg were regarded as models of parkinsonian akinesia and muscle rigidity, respectively. \{MTEP\} at doses between 0.5 and 3 mg/kg i.p. decreased the haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity measured as an increased muscle resistance of the rat's hind leg in response to passive extension and flexion at the ankle joint. The strongest and the longest effect was observed after the dose of 1 mg/kg. \{MTEP\} (0.5–3 mg/kg i.p.) also reduced the haloperidol-induced increase in electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. \{MTEP\} (3 and 5 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited the catalepsy induced by haloperidol. The present study confirms earlier suggestions that the antagonists of mGluR5 may possess antiparkinsonian properties. However, selective mGluR5 antagonists may be more effective in inhibiting parkinsonian muscle rigidity than parkinsonian akinesia.}}

Grazing management is a key issue in the use of grasslands by these birds since they are very sensitive to sward structure (height and heterogeneity). To assess the impact of different grazing regimes on sward structure during spring, sward height was repeatedly measured in a coastal marsh for 2 years. Sward structure was characterised by variables related to height classes and an index of heterogeneity. Grazing regimes were described by stocking rates per period and N fertilisation level. Heterogeneity index was quadratically related to mean sward height both years. Four types of sward structures were characterised through principal component analysis. Co-inertia analysis showed a strong relationship between grazing regimes and sward structure. However, during spring, the relationship between stocking rate and sward structure differed according to year, impact of grazing being greater during drought year. Suitable sward structures were observed for both lapwings and redshanks. Wader habitat management through grazing calls for more attention to be paid to the delayed effects of autumn and winter grazing regimes. Sward heterogeneity emerges as a new characteristic to control, because it may introduce new constraints for livestock production.}}

Two types of cascade models (canonical and microcanonical) are applied to the stochastic fine graining of rainfall observations into high resolution data. In particular, we analyse the disaggregation of 1280-min into 10-min data for a 20-year record period (Zurich raingauge, 1979–1998). Differences between the models and parameter estimation techniques are explored on simulated data with a special focus on three important properties of observed rainfall: distribution, intermittency, and extremes. The canonical models are overall better at preserving the distribution of rainfall at the 10-min scale. It is demonstrated that the growth of intermittency across scales is preserved well with all studied models. The ability of the models to reproduce rainfall extremes is a fundamental requirement in disaggregation. The studied models preserved annual rainfall maxima satisfactorily for short durations; however, the performance deteriorated for longer durations. The canonical models performed substantially better in capturing the variability in rainfall. The results are encouraging considering the parsimonious nature of the models and simple parameter estimation.}}

Fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) is a derivative of this technique that detects the synchronous movement of two biomolecules with different fluorescence labels. Both methods can be applied to live cells and, therefore, can be used to address a variety of unsolved questions in cell biology. Applications of \{FCCS\} with autofluorescent proteins (AFPs) have been hampered so far by cross talk between the detector channels due to the large spectral overlap of the fluorophores. Here we present a new method that combines advantages of these techniques to analyze binding behavior of proteins in live cells. To achieve this, we have used dual color excitation of a common pair of AFPs, \{ECFP\} and EYFP, being discriminated in excitation rather than in emission. This is made possible by pulsed excitation and detection on a shorter timescale compared to the average residence time of particles in the \{FCS\} volume element. By this technique we were able to eliminate cross talk in the detector channels and obtain an undisturbed cross correlation signal. The setup was tested with ECFP/EYFP lysates as well as chimeras as negative and positive controls and demonstrated to work in live HeLa cells coexpressing the two fusion proteins ECFP-connexin and EYFP-connexin.}}

There are a number of assumptions implicit in establishing buffer zones that are typically based on how animals respond to approaching humans. Conventional wisdom suggests that animals will be more sensitive to directly approaching humans than humans approaching tangentially. Visibility and detectability are important factors influencing a species’ response to an approaching threat. Grasslands are an ideal system to study the different approach types because visibility is similar in all directions. We focused on five species of birds, four of them endemic, in the high Pampa de Achala mountain grassland of Argentina to study the effects of direct and tangential approaches on disturbance, and to evaluate five methods typically used to estimate buffer areas considering their sensitivity to the type of approach and their ability to estimate areas large enough to ensure the protection of the target species. We found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, four out of the five species showed greater flight initiation distance response to tangential rather than direct approaches, and that the minimum approach distance and buffer area estimates for these species varied significantly (in some cases an order of magnitude) between methods. Variability in the estimates between methods could be related to their different assumptions, which are not typically evaluated. More generally, we should be cautious when asserting that a buffer area calculated from direct approaches necessarily eliminates human disturbance.}}

Most of the primordial Ar, Kr and Xe and small amounts of He and Ne are removed by oxidation of this acid-resistant residue, e.g. with HNO3. These gases, referred as P1, are trapped in a poorly characterized, presumably organic, phase labeled phase Q. In order to understand the siting of \{P1\} noble gases, we have performed a solvation experiment on insoluble organic matter of Orgueil (CI). Pyridine was used because it presents an important swelling ratio of about 2 potentially able to change considerably the structure of phase Q without affecting the crystalline structure of nanodiamonds, chromite, spinel and metal alloys present in acid residue. Heavy noble gases are largely lost upon pyridine treatment at room temperature. However, the elemental pattern of the remaining Ar, Kr and Xe is not different from that of the starting acid residue, showing similar losses of all the heavy noble gases during solvation. Xenon stepwise heating data and deconvolution of different components based on isotopic ratios show that Xe-P1 is mainly affected by loss (≈ 60%), following by Xe-P3 (≈ 25%) and Xe-HL (≈ 12%). The xenon release is maximum at temperatures ≤ 1300 °C (≈ 70–80%) whereas only 23% is lost at 1600 °C and no further loss occurs at 2100 °C. These results suggest the existence of at least two substructures in phase Q, with Xe-P1 being trapped preferentially in the less retentive phase. As macromolecular organic matter is the only phase of acid residue sensitive to solvation, this study demonstrates the organic nature of phase Q. The behavior of heavy noble gases upon pyridine solvation supports interlayer trapping of these elements, probably within organic layers of aromatic moieties linked by short aliphatic chains.}}

abstract = {Eubacteria synthesize a full-length (ClpB95) and a N-terminally truncated (ClpB80) version of the ClpB disaggregase owing to the presence of a translation initiation site within the clpB transcript. Why these two isoforms have been evolutionary conserved is poorly understood. Here, we constructed a series of E. coli strains and plasmids allowing production of the ClpB95/ClpB80 pair, ClpB95 alone, or ClpB80 alone from near physiological concentrations to a 6–10-fold excess over normal cellular levels. We found that although overexpressed ClpB95 or ClpB80 can independently restore basal thermotolerance to ΔclpB cells, strains expressing ClpB80 from the clpB chromosomal locus do not exhibit increased resistance to thermal killing at 50 °C relative to clpB null cells. Furthermore, synthesis of physiological levels of ClpB95 is less effective than coordinated expression of ClpB95/ClpB80 in protecting E. coli from thermal killing. These results provide an explanation for the conservation of the two ClpB isoforms in eubacteria and are consistent with the fact that wild type E. coli maintains the ClpB80 to ClpB95 ratio at a nearly constant value of 0.4–0.5 under a variety of stress conditions.}}

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent and serious metabolic disease affecting people all over the world. Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance are the hallmark of type 2 diabetes. Normal β-cells can compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion and/or β-cell mass, but insufficient compensation leads to the onset of glucose intolerance. Once hyperglycemia becomes apparent, β-cell function gradually deteriorates and insulin resistance aggravates. Under diabetic conditions, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress are induced in various tissues, leading to activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. The activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase suppresses insulin biosynthesis and interferes with insulin action. Indeed, suppression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in diabetic mice improves insulin resistance and ameliorates glucose tolerance. Thus, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway plays a central role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and could be a potential target for diabetes therapy.}}

A burn injury can be stratified into three main zones, coagulation, stasis and edema, which correlate with the extent of heat exposure and thermal properties of the tissue. While there has been considerable effort to characterize the time–temperature dependence of the injury, relatively little attention has been paid to the other important variable, the thermal susceptibility of the tissue. In the present study, we employ a standard physical chemistry approach to predict the level of denaturation at supraphysiological temperatures of 12 vital proteins as well as RNA, \{DNA\} and cell membrane components. Melting temperatures and unfolding enthalpies of the cellular components are used as input experimental parameters. This approach allows us to establish a relation between the level of denaturation of critical cellular components and clinical manifestations of the burn through the characteristic zones of the injury. Specifically, we evaluate the degree of molecular alteration for characteristic temperature profiles at two different depths (Mid-Dermis and Dermis-Fat interface) of 80 °C; 20 s contact burn. The results of this investigation suggest that the thermal alteration of the plasma membrane is likely the most significant cause of the tissue necrosis. The lipid bilayer and membrane-bound \{ATPases\} show a high probability of thermal damage (almost 100% for the former and 85% for the latter) for short heat exposure times. These results suggest that strategies to minimize the damage in a burn injury might focus on the stabilization of the cellular membrane and membrane-bound ATPases. Further work will be required to validate these predictions in an in vivo model.}}

The controlled release behavior of ibuprofen (IBU) from these microspheres was investigated. The \{PEC\} microspheres were about 700–950 μm in diameter with large pores and open porous structure. The CS/TPP/DS microspheres resisted hydrolysis in strong acid and biodegradation in enzymatic surroundings. The swelling kinetics for \{CS\} microspheres was close to Fickian diffusion, whereas those for CS/TPP and CS/TPP/DS were non-Fickian. Furthermore, the equilibrium water content (EWC) and water diffusion coefficient (D) increased with the pH of the media. The release profiles of \{IBU\} from CS/TPP/DS microspheres were slow in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.4) over 3 h, but nearly all of the initial drug content was released in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 6.8) within 6 h after changing media. Overall the results demonstrated that CS/TPP/DS microspheres could successfully deliver a hydrophobic drug to the intestine without losing the drug in the stomach, and hence could be potential candidates as an orally administered drug delivery system.}}

Here, we report the crystal structure of the \{ENT\} domain of EMSY, consisting of a unique arrangement of five α-helices that fold into a helical bundle arrangement. The fold shares regions of structural homology with the DNA-binding domain of homeodomain proteins. The \{ENT\} domain forms a homodimer via the anti-parallel packing of the extended N-terminal α-helix of each molecule. It is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic residues at the dimer interface and has a dissociation constant in the low micromolar range.

Here, we take advantage of the wealth of experimental data available on the canonical RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway of Bhalla et al. to test the utility of a newly developed nonlinear analysis algorithm designed to predict likelihood of cellular transformation. By using \{ERK\} phosphorylation as an “output signal”, the method analyzes experimentally determined kinetic data and predicts putative oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene products impacting the RAS/MAPK module using a purely theoretical approach. This analysis identified several modifiers of ERK/MAPK activation described previously. In addition, several novel enzymes are identified which are not previously described to affect ERK/MAPK phosphorylation. Importantly, the nonlinear analysis enables a ranking of modifiers of \{MAPK\} activation predicting their relative importance in RAS-dependent oncogenesis. The results are compared with a linearized analysis based on sensitivity analysis about the steady state or metabolic control analysis (MCA). The results are favorable, pointing to the utility of first-order sensitivity analysis and \{MCA\} in the analysis of complex signaling networks for oncogenes.}}

With constant copper loading at 15 wt%, the effects of Cr content varying from 0 to 5 wt% on surface properties and catalytic activity were investigated. In addition to RHA, commercial silica gel was also used as catalyst support for comparison to study the effect of support material. Surface characterizations were examined extensively by XRD, TPR, SEM, \{N2\} sorption, and H2–N2O titration, while catalytic activities were studied using ethanol dehydrogenation. The results indicate that copper dispersion is enhanced by the initial increase in Cr2O3 promoter content up to 2 wt%, while it then deteriorates gradually upon further increase in promoter content. It has been suggested that an optimal Cr content around 2 wt% not only enhances catalytic activity but also retards catalyst deactivation. Generally speaking, catalyst deactivation results predominantly from copper sintering. Despite the lower \{BET\} surface area, \{RHA\} is superior to commercial silica gel as a candidate for catalyst support in this work, because the surface of the former may possess more unique pores, while the majority of surface pores on the latter are interconnected and thus can be clogged easily.}}

We report the study of biosynthesis regulation of Bacillus intermedius glutamyl endopeptidase under salt stress conditions. Salt stress during growth in medium containing 1–2.5 M NaCl, \{KCl\} or disodium succinate leads to the induction of glutamyl endopeptidase. Analysis of the regulatory region of the gene for B. intermedius glutamyl endopeptidase revealed the presence of a tentative target sequence for DegU control, AGATN10TTGAG. For the expression of the glutamyl endopeptidase gene, functional DegU protein is required. Thus, we suggest that expression of the gene for B. intermedius glutamyl endopeptidase may be controlled by a regulatory system analogous to DegS–DegU two-component system in B. subtilis.}}

Expression of the receptor in endometrium was increased at stage of proestrus cycle under physiological condition. Exogenous administration of progesterone into female rats significantly reduced the expression, while administration of estradiol or pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) did not. Both, endometrium in experimental endometriosis induced in rats and the tissues from patients with ectopic endometriosis showed a higher expression of \{LXA4\} receptor compared to the normal tissues.

We evaluate Bidirectional \{LSTM\} (BLSTM) and several other network architectures on the benchmark task of framewise phoneme classification, using the \{TIMIT\} database. Our main findings are that bidirectional networks outperform unidirectional ones, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is much faster and also more accurate than both standard Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) and time-windowed Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results support the view that contextual information is crucial to speech processing, and suggest that \{BLSTM\} is an effective architecture with which to exploit it.11An abbreviated version of some portions of this article appeared in (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), as part of the \{IJCNN\} 2005 conference proceedings, published under the \{IEEE\} copyright.}}

abstract = {Smoking is a major cause of human lung cancer. Past studies suggest that apoptosis might influence the malignant phenotype, but little is known about the association between apoptosis and cigarette smoke (CS)-induced lung pathogenesis. Using an in situ cell death detection kit (TA300), the association of \{CS\} with apoptosis was determined in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of related proteins were investigated in the terminal bronchiole areas of the lung tissue from rats exposed to CS. Results showed that the expression of phosphotyrosine proteins was increased significantly in lung tissue of rats exposed to \{CS\} from 5 to 15 cigarettes. Using Western blotting and immunoprecipitation assay, Fas, a death receptor, was proved just be one of these phosphotyrosine proteins. \{CS\} triggered activation of \{MAP\} kinase (p38/JNK or ERK2) pathway, which led to Jun or p53 phosphorylation and FasL induction links Fas phosphorylation. Further, smoke treatment produced an increase in the level of proapoptotic proteins (Bax, t-Bid, cytochrome c and caspase-3), but a decline in Bcl-2, procaspase-8 and procaspase-9 proteins. Thus, CS-induced apoptosis may result from two main mechanisms, one is the activation of p38/JNK-Jun-FasL signaling, and the other is stimulated by the stabilization of p53, increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, release of cytochrome c; thus, leading to activation of caspase cascade.}}

Growing resistance of Plasmodia towards available drugs is an increasing problem in countries where malaria is endemic. As Plasmodia are sensitive to oxidative stress, augmenting this in the parasite represents a promising principle for the development of novel antimalarial drugs. The NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) of P. falciparum is largely responsible for the production of \{NADPH\} in the parasite, which in turn serves as electron source for the antioxidative enzymes glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. As \{GDH\} does not occur in the host erythrocyte, \{GDH\} is a particularly attractive target for drug therapy. The three-dimensional structure of P. falciparum \{GDH\} in the unligated state has been determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.7 Å. Compared to the mammalian enzymes, two amino acid residues are exchanged in the putative active site of the parasite GDH. The most obvious differences between parasite and human \{GDH\} are the subunit interfaces of the hexameric proteins. In the parasite protein, several salt-bridges mediate contacts between the subunits whereas in the human enzyme these interactions are mainly of hydrophobic nature. Furthermore, P. falciparum \{GDH\} possesses a unique N-terminal extension that does not occur in any other \{GDH\} sequence so far studied. These findings might be exploited for the design of peptidomimetics capable of disrupting the oligomeric organisation of the parasite enzyme.}}

The particular characteristics of these alterations, 80% of which are missense mutations leading to functionally heterogeneous proteins, make p53 a unique gene in the class of tumor suppressor genes. A considerable number of mutant p53 proteins probably have an oncogenic activity per se and therefore actively participate in cell transformation. The fact that the apoptotic and antiproliferative functions of p53 can be dissociated in certain mutants also suggests another level of complexity in the relationships between p53 inactivation and neoplasia.}}

In the post-genomic era, the concept of systems biology has gained significant momentum and biomedical research is now being conducted on an integrated and cross-disciplinary platform that pulls together its resources from diverse fields such as computational biology, bioinformatics, functional genomics, structural biology, and proteomics. In this perspective, the identity of established biologic systems is being re-examined in the light of novel findings that suggest novel associations between otherwise unrelated pathways and individual proteins. Complement exemplifies such a system that, transcending its innate immune identity, has forged functional associations with multiple pathways and networks in modulating basic biologic processes. In the present article, we provide a global overview of these unusual system associations of complement with the aid of a powerful and high-throughput bioinformatics platform. Using a novel approach called systems literature analysis that allows the rapid extraction of text-based associations between genes and pathways from the ever expanding scientific article database, we have selected a broad range of biologic processes modulated by complement proteins and have constructed an integrated map of complement-mediated networks that incorporates well over 85 diverse biologic pathways. Expanding the complement cascade beyond its ∼35 designated components, we discuss protein–protein interactions involving novel ligands and associations with signaling cascades and cellular networks that affect both inflammatory and non-inflammatory processes. This integrated consideration of complement within a unified ‘systems biology’ framework underscores the concept that innate immunity goes well beyond the protection of ‘self’ extending links to critical developmental, homeostatic, and metabolic processes.}}

Evidence suggests an increase in antigen presenting cell (APC) activity as a contributing factor to this process, as well as potential roles for both \{AM\} and interstitial macrophages (IM) in silicosis. In order to study the effects of crystalline silica on the \{APC\} activity of pulmonary macrophages, mice were exposed intranasally and changes in pulmonary macrophage populations were assessed using flow cytometry. Following intranasal instillation of silica, a significant increase in the \{APC\} activity of \{AM\} was observed, as well as a significant increase in a subset of \{IM\} expressing classic \{APC\} markers (MHC class II, CD11c). In addition, an in vitro system using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was generated to assess the effects of silica on the \{APC\} activity of macrophages in vitro. Data using \{BMDM\} in the in vitro \{APC\} assay demonstrated a significant increase in \{APC\} activity following silica exposure, but not following exposure to saline or a control particle (TiO2). Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments, the current study describes a significant increase in an interstitial macrophage subset with an \{APC\} phenotype, as well as an increase in the \{APC\} activity of both \{AM\} and BMDM, as a direct result of exposure to crystalline silica. These studies suggest a specific mechanism, macrophage subset activation, by which crystalline silica exposure results in chronic pulmonary inflammation and, eventually, fibrosis.}}

In coeliacs, the presence of an increased fracture risk was recently questioned and its importance on clinical grounds was reconsidered, in view of the fact that gluten-free diet generally improves bone mass and, consequently, reduces fracture risk. However, gluten-free diet rarely normalizes bone mass and the co-administration of mineral active drugs may be useful in a subgroup of coeliacs.}}

Positive immunoreactivity observed for \{TLR4\} suggests that myometrial cells have the potential to respond to LPS. To confirm that \{LPS\} signals via TLR4, the ability of an anti-TLR4 neutralizing antibody to block LPS-induced translocation of p65 was demonstrated. To determine whether LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 is mediated through the \{PKC\} pathway, myometrial cells were treated with various inhibitors of the \{PKC\} isoforms already characterized in human myometrium. Neither the selective conventional \{PKC\} inhibitor nor the inhibitor of PKCδ affected NF-kB activation. By contrast, we found that treatment of myometrial cells with an antisense against PKCζ affect LPS-induced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kB. Accordingly, our data support the notion that PKCζ is essential for LPS-induced NF-kB p65 subunit nuclear translocation in human myometrial cells.}}

The manufacturing technique allows extraordinary complexity in the routing of fluid streams through the process, thus enabling very high levels of process integration to be achieved without significant capital or plant volume penalty. The fine passages employed in the structure have characteristic dimensions of around 1 mm, thus promoting further process intensification especially in heat transfer.The \{PCHE\} technique produces scaleable modules ideally suited to a wide range of production capacities, from miniplant to world scale. In our work, we explore the concept of distributed manufacture based on miniplants, as espoused by Benson and Ponton more than 10 years ago. We believe this paradigm offers new capital-accessible opportunities for chemical processing in smaller and more isolated economies such as in Australia and in the developing countries.A pilot plant for the production of syngas or hydrogen by the reforming of natural gas with steam has been installed at the University of Sydney. The main plant module contains nine reactors, 10 combustors and 11 heat exchangers in a single integrated block.

Surfactants can improve properties such as shelf-life, freeze–thaw stability and mechanical stability. However, the addition of surfactants can also have a negative effect on end-use properties, such as the water resistance of the coating. The type and amount of surfactant used is an important determinant of system behaviour during polymerization, film formation, and throughout the lifetime of the formed coating. The molecular architecture of binder particles is of crucial importance to latex paint properties. The type of surfactant used to stabilize binder particles had an effect on the adhesion of the paint to both alkyd-coated and Zincalume™ panels. The binders containing the polymeric surfactant showed better adhesion to these substrates, as they were better able to wet the surface of the substrates. However, polymeric surfactants also gave a greater amount of blistering when exposed to water and longer recovery times after exposure. The more hydrophobic the stabilization system, the greater the abrasion resistance observed, presumably due to the reduced extent of film plasticization by water. Accelerated weathering tests showed that these systems, designed to have low water sensitivity, gave good protection properties in regards to corrosion and blistering. \{UV\} exposure resulted in severe degradation of all films except where the binder contained acrylic acid, which is proposed to act as a photo-stabilizer.}}

We concluded that platelet membranes from centenarians show deeper structural and functional modifications than in elderly subjects and that these changes might play a protective role against oxidative damage. No statistical difference in biochemical parameters was observed between two sibpairs in each twin pair highlighting that environmental factors (diet, life-style) affect age-related platelet membrane changes less than their common genetic component. Thus genetic factors might play an important role in the mechanisms at the basis of successful aging.}}

abstract = {The increasing use of biomaterials in clinical medicine to augment or replace failing organ function has heightened the need to apply relevant test systems to study the safety and efficacy of new medical devices. This becomes all the more important as the field of "tissue engineering" develops, in which the aim is to reconstruct tissue and organ function, for example, by using the patient's own cells seeded on to a three-dimensional (3-D) scaffold structure. In the biomaterial research field, there has been a necessary expansion of the concept of biocompatibility to address not only the biosafety issue, that is, the exclusion of cytotoxic and other deleterious effects of biomaterials, but also the biofunctionality component, which concerns the fulfilment of the intended function of the applied biomaterial. Careful scrutiny of this concept leads to the conclusion that relevant test systems for biofunctionality must centre on human cells, studied under conditions relevant to the situation in the living organism for which the medical device has been constructed. Thus, progress in biocompatibility and tissue engineering would today be inconceivable without the aid of in vitro techniques. In designing such biofunctionality assays, there are certain fundamental principles which must be adhered to. A constant difficulty is the availability of sterile human tissue for such test systems. Also of paramount importance is proving the maintenance of the cell phenotype in vitro. Loss of essential characteristic functions of the cultivated cells makes extrapolatory interpretations meaningless for the clinical situation. This paper gives an overview of the basic design principles for suitable assays, and various examples covering a spectrum of applications. Relevant functional parameters will be emphasised, as well as the use of modern methods of cell and molecular biology, with measurement of these parameters at both the gene product and transcription levels. These parameters include the expression of cytokines, growth factors and cell adhesion molecules. In addition, assays can be constructed to study inflammation and the wound healing response, which includes the angiogenic reaction. Tissue remodelling around biomaterials can be studied in vitro by using cells such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells and various inflammatory cells, important parameters reflecting control of this remodelling being the matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors. The need for more co-culture and 3-D models is stressed and data from the authors' own laboratory are presented to illustrate these principles. Finally, the importance of signal transduction within those cells in contact with, or in the vicinity of, biomaterials is emphasised, as this knowledge offers the scientific basis for rational therapeutic intervention to suppress negative effects and enhance positive biological responses (use of drug delivery systems). In understanding these processes modern technologies using nucleic acid micro-arrays coupled with methods of bioinformatics will hopefully identify key genes which can be targeted. Well-designed in vitro assays have a central role to play in this endeavour.}}

Focussing on the trade in chameleons from Madagascar, our objective was to investigate the consequences of changes in governance on the number of individuals and species traded together with the prices paid to collectors, intermediaries and exporters. As a result of the liberalisation of export controls in 1988, exports of chameleons grew exponentially at an average rate of 62% per annum, the trade in Calumma spp. increasing at 91% per annum. The intervention of \{CITES\} in 1994, as a result of concerns over the trade, capped official exports at approximately 20,000 per annum and also restricted the trade to four species of Furcifer. The consequence of the \{CITES\} intervention was a shift in the species exported from a mix of Calumma harvested in the east and Furcifer harvested in the west to a trade in Furcifer alone, alongside an increase in the number of Furcifer exports. Consequently there was a shift in the distribution of local benefits gained from the trade away from the rainforests in the east, the centre of conservation concern. At the same time there was also a fall in the prices paid to collectors and intermediaries involved in the trade and a widening of the gap with the prices paid to exporters. The creation of an Experimental Management Programme within Madagascar to address the concerns of \{CITES\} in 1998/1999 and lobby for some expansion of the trade, led to an initial fall in the number of chameleons traded. Failure to achieve the latter objective has more recently led to an increase in the number of species traded and a further widening of the prices paid to collectors and exporters. These results highlight the need to consider carefully the consequences of changes in governance on the wildlife trade if conservation and local people are to benefit from the trade in wildlife resources.}}

Stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in humans evokes head pain. Second-order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus that are activated by \{SSS\} stimulation can be inhibited by \{PAG\} stimulation. The present study was undertaken to identify pontine and medullary structures that respond to noxious stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus or to ventrolateral \{PAG\} stimulation. The distribution of neurons expressing the protein product (fos) of the c-fos immediate early gene were examined in the rostral medulla and caudal pons of the cat after (i) sham, (ii) stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus, (iii) stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus with \{PAG\} stimulation, or (iv) stimulation of the \{PAG\} alone. The structures examined for fos were the trigeminal nucleus, infratrigeminal nucleus, reticular nuclei, nucleus raphe magnus, pontine blink premotor area, and superior salivatory nucleus. Compared with all other interventions, fos expression was significantly greater in the trigeminal nucleus and superior salivatory nucleus after \{SSS\} stimulation. After \{PAG\} with \{SSS\} stimulation, on the side ipsilateral to the site of \{PAG\} stimulation, fos was significantly greater in the nucleus raphe magnus. These structures are likely to be involved in the neurobiology of migraine.}}

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses genetic regulatory networks, which mainly concern interactions between proteins and nucleic acids, controlling the transcription and translation of genes. Genetic regulatory networks play an important role in the functioning and differentiation of cells. A large part of the experimental data available notably transcriptome data, concern these networks. Notwithstanding their importance, one should bear in mind that genetic regulatory networks are integrated in the cell with other types of networks, sometimes to the point that they become difficult to separate. In addition to high-throughput experimental methods, mathematical, and computational approaches are indispensable for the analysis of genetic regulatory networks. Given the large number of components of most networks of biological interest often connected by positive and negative feedback loops, an intuitive comprehension of the dynamics of the system is difficult, if not impossible to obtain. Mathematical modeling supported by computer tools can contribute to the analysis of a regulatory network by allowing the biologist to focus on a restricted number of plausible hypotheses.}}

Although they have different etiologies and clinical manifestations, most of them share similar histopathologic characteristics such as the presence of inclusion bodies in both neurons and glial cells, which represent intracellular aggregation of misfolded or aberrant proteins. In Parkinson’s disease, formation of inclusion bodies has been associated with the aggresome-related process and consequently with the centrosome. However, the significance of the centrosome in the neurodegenerative process remains obscure. In the present study, the morphological and functional changes in the centrosome induced by rotenone, a common insecticide used to produce experimental Parkinsonism, were examined both in vitro and in vivo. Aggregation of γ-tubulin protein, which is a component of the centrosome matrix and recently identified in Lewy bodies of Parkinson’s disease, was observed in primary cultures of mesencephalic cells treated with rotenone. Rotenone-treated neurons and astrocytes showed enlarged and multiple centrosomes. These centrosomes also displayed multiple aggregates of α-synuclein protein. Neurons with disorganized centrosomes exhibited neurite retraction and microtubule destabilization, and astrocytes showed disturbances of mitotic spindles. The Golgi apparatus, which is closely related to the centrosome, was dispersed in both rotenone-treated neuronal cells and the substantia nigra of rotenone-treated rats. Our findings suggested that recruitment of abnormal proteins in the centrosome contributed to the formation of inclusion bodies, and that rotenone markedly affected the structure and function of the centrosome with consequent induction of cytoskeleton disturbances, disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and collapse of neuronal cells.}}

IL-27 acts in synergy with IL-12 early during Th1 development from naïve T cells. IL-27 functions through the WSX-1 and the gpl30 receptor subunits, which shares homology with the IL-12Rβ2 subunit. We have previously reported that IL-23 is up-regulated in CD11b+ microglia/macrophages in the \{CNS\} during the early phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and thus may contribute to the early induction of EAE. In the present study, we examined the expression of IL-27 and its receptor in the CNS, spleen, and lymph nodes at different stages of \{EAE\} actively induced with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide35–55. Our findings show that IL-27 \{EBI3\} and p28 mRNA were up-regulated to a maximum level at the peak of disease in \{APC\} from the \{CNS\} and lymph nodes, but not in the spleen. Moreover, IL-27 receptor (WSX-1) expression was greatly up-regulated during the early stage of \{EAE\} in both the \{CNS\} and lymph nodes. Taken together, our data show that subunits of IL-27 and its receptor (WSX-1) mRNAs are markedly up-regulated in inflammatory cells in the \{CNS\} at the peak of disease. Thus, IL-27 produced by infiltrating cells in the \{CNS\} may regulate in a paracrine manner the Th1 response in EAE.}}

Given the previous observations, this study investigates the effect of \{BIC\} on the cell cycle progression and regulatory function of Raw264.7 macrophage cells and the responsible signaling pathways. Cell cycle analysis revealed that \{BIC\} completely suppressed proliferation of Raw264.7 cells with inhibition of the percentage of cells in the S phase and the reciprocal decrease in the G0/G1 phase. \{DNA\} synthesis was also inhibited by BIC, as evidenced by a decrease in the cellular incorporation of [3H]thymidine. The G1/S arrest induced by \{BIC\} was reversed by chemical inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) or overexpression of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. Either \{PD98059\} or stable transfection with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 [MKK1(−)] or c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 [JNK1(−)] also released the cell cycle arrest. Immunoblot analyses revealed that the levels of cyclins D1, A and \{B1\} were partly or completely down-regulated by BIC, but cyclin E, p21 and p27 were minimally changed. Chemical inhibition and dominant negative mutant overexpression experiments revealed that either PI3-kinase inhibition or JNK1(−) transfection prevented the decreases in cyclin D1, A and \{B1\} by BIC, indicating that the PI3-kinase and \{JNK1\} pathways were associated with disruption of the cyclins. The pathway involving MKK1-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) was responsible for the suppression of cyclin A and B1, but not that of cyclin D1. The present study showed that \{BIC\} inhibited proliferation of Raw264.7 cells and that the pathways involving PI3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases regulate the cell cycle arrest.}}

In the present study, we present evidence that RORα also induces transcription of the human Apolipoprotein \{AV\} gene, a recently identified apolipoprotein associated with triglyceride levels. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of RORα increased the endogenous expression of ApoAV in HepG2 cells and RORα also enhanced the activity of an ApoAV promoter construct in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. Deletion and mutation studies identified three \{AGGTCA\} motifs in the ApoAV promoter that mediate RORα transactivation, one of which overlaps with a previously identified binding site for PPARα. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism whereby RORα modulates lipid metabolism and implies RORα as a potential target for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.}}

However, the various dimensions of quality performance and the relationship between them have received less attention from the research community.

The status of these data and the remaining experimental quests are briefly sketched in the light of recent achievements and future possibilities. Presently, s-process calculations are capable of providing a quantitative description of the observed abundances that can be attributed to an s-process origin. Moreover, these results can be interpreted as constraints for models of the red giant phase, an important feature for improving our understanding of persisting difficulties in stellar evolution.}}

The paper outlines the contribution of non-photosynthetic pigments to the protection of plants from excess light and UV-radiation, as well as the mechanisms involved. A large pool of secondary metabolites, belonging mainly to the highly diversified array of flavonoids (C6–C3–C6 types), and the closely related anthocyanins (flavylium salts, C6–C3–C6+ types), as well as betacyanins are often referred to as non-photosynthetic pigments. In addition to screening out incoming visible and UV-radiation by absorbtion, these pigments can dissipate excess photon energy, while the antioxidant and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability of non-photosynthetic pigments can also protect against light- and UV-induced oxidative stress. Their role in adjustment of source activity to reduced sink strength is examined as a possible mechanism of protection in conditions where excess light stress is aggravated by other constraints limiting the \{CO2\} assimilation. Evidence for the photoprotective role involving UV-screening, antioxidant activity, ROS-scavenging and energy-dissipation of another group of secondary metabolites, cinnamic acid derivatives (C6–C3 types), is also discussed.}}

abstract = {The agents responsible for the therapeutic effects of many botanical supplements have not been established in spite of their popularity. Here we show that melanin is a previously unrecognized immunostimulatory compound that is a major component of botanicals traditionally used to enhance immune function. While melanin is present in commonly consumed vegetables, its specific activity is several orders of magnitude less than melanin extracted from these botanicals. The major reason that this agent has eluded detection is its solvent-specific requirement for extraction/solubility. Melanin activates NF-kappa B in monocytes in vitro through a toll-like receptor 2-dependent process. Ingestion of melanin by mice for four days increases production ex vivo of interferon-γ by spleen cells and IgA and interleukin-6 by Peyer's patch cells. The identification of this new class of mucosal immune stimulants will allow further characterization of botanical products and advances our understanding of the basis for their traditional use.}}

How do distinct neural subcircuits, composed of different classes of neuron, contribute to brain function? Approaching this question requires methods that can target specific neurons types. This can be achieved by harnessing the same machinery that builds sophistication into the brain and using it to make novel tools for investigating and manipulating the brain: molecular and genetic technology. These tools can be used to target gene expression to specific neuron types within complicated neuronal circuits, and the transgenes that are expressed can be used to elucidate and manipulate these circuits with unprecedented precision and control. These methods are likely to become the archetype for future studies linking perception, cognition and behavior to specific components of the brain.}}

Formation of anchoring villi, proliferation of cell columns and invasion of extravillous cytotrophoblasts into maternal decidual stroma and vessels induce vascular changes ensuring an adequate blood supply to the growing fetus. Extravillous trophoblast differentiation is regulated by numerous growth factors as well as by extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion molecules expressed at the fetal–maternal interface. These regulatory molecules control cell invasion by modulating activities of matrix-degrading protease systems and \{ECM\} adhesion. The differentiation process involves numerous signalling cascades/proteins such as the \{GTPases\} RhoA, the protein kinases ROCK, ERK1, ERK2, FAK, PI3K, Akt/protein kinase B and mTOR as well as TGF-β-dependent \{SMAD\} factors. While an increasing number of signalling pathways regulating trophoblast differentiation are being unravelled, downstream effectors such as executing transcription factors remain largely elusive. Here, we summarise our current knowledge on signal transduction cascades regulating invasive trophoblast differentiation. We will focus on cell model systems which are used to study the particular differentiation process and discuss signalling pathways which regulate trophoblast proliferation and motility.}}

This paper describes a solution for dynamically creating optical connections between different autonomous domains. This was implemented in the form of a Grid Service following the Open Grid Service Architecture. In our prototype, each switch belongs to a different network domain. Our Grid Service uses a toolkit based on the Generic Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting framework. This toolkit authorizes the use of optical infrastructure elements based on specific policies that are active within each domain. To complete our multi-domain authorization architecture, a Broker Service was also implemented. Our Broker Service interacts with the Grid Service instances to provide Grid application with a simplified way to set up end-to-end connections on demand.}}

Its population counts 2 million inhabitants of which 70% are concentrated in the downstream part of the basin. It has a high industrial activity and an intensive agriculture. The Marne River water supplies drinking water production to a large number of Parisians. A diversion reservoir (350×106 m3) is used mainly to sustain summer low flows. On the basis of field observations and experimental studies, a hydrological and ecological model of this river system was built using the Riverstrahler approach (Billen, G., Garnier, J., Hanset, Ph., 1994. Modelling phytoplankton development in whole drainage networks: the riverstrahler model applied to the seine river system. Hydrobiologia 289, 119–137; Garnier, J., Billen, G., Coste, M., 1995. Seasonnal succession of diatoms and Chlorophyceae in the drainage network of the river Seine: observations and modelling. Limnol. Oceanogr. 40, 750–765). The modelling strategy was to consider separately nine sub-basins and the main branch, to which was coupled a model of the reservoir. The point and diffuse sources of nutrients were analysed over more than 10 years (1991–2001) taking into account the role of exchangeable phosphorus (Némery (2003). Origine et devenir du phosphore dans le continuum aquatique de la Seine, des petis basins à l'estuaire. Rôle du phosphore échangeable sur l'eutrophisation. Thèse Univ. Paris 6, p. 258; Némery, J., Garnier, J., Morel, C., 2004. Phosphorus budget in the Marne watershed (France): urban vs. diffuse sources, dissolved vs. particulate forms. Biogeochemistry (in press)). The model was validated through its ability to reproduce available water quality observations. Different realistic scenarios of future reduction of phosphorus load were tested, in various hydrological conditions (dry and wet years). Phytoplankton development can be slightly reduced by a further 85% abatement of phosphorus in all the wastewater treatment plants of the basin, but a reduction both of diffuse and point phosphorus sources would be necessary to further decrease eutrophication.}}

Various techniques including XRD, \{N2\} sorption, \{MAS\} \{NMR\} and \{SEM\} were used to monitor the physico-chemical properties of these solids. The results revealed a high purity and crystallinity of the materials, and that the Ga atoms are entirely incorporated into the framework. The ammonia \{TPD\} measurements indicated that the isomorphous substitution of aluminium by gallium leads to a decrease of both acidic strength and acid sites concentration. The catalytic performances of the EMT-type solids in the conversion of methylaromatic hydrocarbons were correlated with their acid properties. Thus, the less acidic (Al,Ga)EMT samples exhibited a lower activity, but a higher selectivity towards the xylenes formation by comparison with (Al)EMT.}}

In contrast, Hsp90 function was primarily necessary to express the FFLux-encoding gene from an inducible promoter.

Whereas developmental biologists explicitly investigate these mechanisms at the hormonal and genetic levels, they largely ignore the role of environmental input.

The mean level of synchronization was determined in different frequency bands with the synchronization likelihood and fluctuations of the synchronization level were analysed with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Results The mean level of \{EEG\} synchronization was lower in Alzheimer patients in the upper alpha (10–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) band. Spontaneous fluctuations of synchronization were diminished in Alzheimer patients in the lower alpha (8–10 Hz) and beta bands. In patients as well as controls the synchronization fluctuations showed a scale-free pattern. Conclusions Alzheimer's disease is characterized both by a lower mean level of functional connectivity as well as by diminished fluctuations in the level of synchronization. The dynamics of these fluctuations in patients and controls was scale-free which might point to self-organized criticality of neural networks in the brain. Significance Impaired functional connectivity can manifest itself not only in decreased levels of synchronization but also in disturbed fluctuations of synchronization levels.}}

abstract = {Fast rhythmic activity in a frequency range between 20 and 40 Hz occurs in vitro in hippocampal area \{CA3\} after activation of muscarinic receptors. Here we show that carbachol-induced rhythmic activity is modulated by serotonin (5-HT). Spectral analysis reveals that 5-HT (0.3–30 μM) decreases power, but not frequency, of rhythmic activity in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner. The 5-HT1A agonists 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone mimic the effect of 5-HT, whereas the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (1 μM) significantly prevents the effect of 5-HT. In contrast to the effect of 5-HT1A agonists, the 5-HT2 agonist \{DOI\} increases spectral power and prevents the reduction of spectral power by 5-HT. Application of WAY-100635 alone has no effect on rhythmic activity. Likewise, the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin (10 μM) does not affect rhythmic activity, or its reduction by 5-HT. Finally, the 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor fluoxetine significantly decreases rhythmic activity in the presence of a low concentration of 5-HT, suggesting that 5-HT released from terminals in the slice likely reduces rhythmic activity. These results strongly implicate 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors in the modulation of spectral power of carbachol-induced rhythmic activity and that 5-HT1A receptors are responsible for the prevailing effect of 5-HT.}}

We provide computational and analytical support for the hypothesis that network entropy is a quantitative measure of robustness. We formulate an evolutionary model based on entropy as a selective criterion and show that (a) it predicts the direction of changes in network structure over evolutionary time and (b) it accounts for the high degree of robustness and the heterogenous connectivity distribution, which is often observed in biological and technological networks. Our model is based on Darwinian principles of evolution and preferentially selects networks according to a global fitness criterion, rather than local preferences in classical models of network growth. We predict that the evolutionarily stable states of evolved networks will be characterized by extremal values of network entropy.}}

The mobile objects are modeled as four-way-biased random walkers in two-dimensional square lattice. It is found that there is always a phase transition from free flow to jammed state at some critical density with and without back step under sequential and parallel update for large systems. Back step does not reduce congestion as one might expect. In fact, back step makes congestion worse in terms of critical density. The critical density with back step is smaller than the critical density without back step under sequential and parallel update for large systems. Back step under parallel update leads to completely jammed state, whereas back step under sequential update leads to partially jammed state. The critical density under parallel update is smaller than the critical density under sequential update with and without back step. Variable drift has no significant effects on the congestion properties.}}

Actin filaments position the endomembrane system and act as a substrate on which organelle motility occurs. Other actin-filament arrays appear to be more dynamic and to reorganize in response to growth signals and external cues. The diverse cellular functions of the actin cytoskeleton are mediated by actin-binding proteins that nucleate, destabilize, and bundle actin filaments. The distorted trichome morphology mutants provide a simple genetic system in which to study mechanisms of actin-dependent morphogenesis. Recent results from several groups indicate that ‘distorted group’ genes encode subunits of the actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 and \{WAVE\} complexes, and function in a cell morphogenesis pathway.}}

Together these data pointed to phospholipase C as the direct target of lindane activation. Type I phosphoinositide 3-kinase was not significantly activated by lindane and an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinases inhibited oxidant production by only 40%. Thus, Type I phosphoinositide 3-kinase played a minor role, if any, in lindane-induced oxidant production.

One on the overall context of construction project planning, and two focused on requirements capture for the virtual construction site system.

The results show that construction planning for principal contractors is more about negotiation with other interested parties and rapid decision-making based on heuristics than detailed analysis.}}

Fifteen patients were assessed for symptoms (SAPS-SANS) and undergone a complete neuropsychological assessment at two sessions. The first session (S1) was carried out within six days after admission, i.e., acute phase and the second (S2) at least two month after hospitalization, i.e., stable phase. The data were analyzed using stepwise regression models in which neuropsychological scores were in entered to predict each dimensional score. This analysis was applied on the \{S1\} and \{S2\} data as well as on the \{S2\} − \{S1\} difference to assess the neuropsychological predictors of clinical changes. Generally, the results replicate the previous associations between neuropsychological and dimensional measures found in stable patients. In addition, this study shows if each dimension appears to rely on a key structure, symptom variations seems to involve changes in the spread of the dysfunction and/or changes in the connectivity between the key and other regions. The results also suggest that functional changes related to some symptoms dimensions occur to compensate for the dysfunction associated with other symptoms.}}

Western blot analysis detected the P2X1,2,4,5,6,7 and P2Y1,2,4,6, but not the \{P2X3\} and \{P2Y12\} receptors. We then investigated which biological effects were mediated by the \{P2Y4\} subtype and its physiological pyrimidine agonist UTP. We found that neuronal differentiation of the SH-SY5Y cells with dibutiryl-cAMP increased the expression of the \{P2Y4\} protein and that \{UTP\} itself was able to positively interfere with neuritogenesis. Moreover, transient transfection and activation of \{P2Y4\} also facilitated neuritogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells, as detected by morphological phase contrast analysis and confocal examination of neurofilament proteins NFL. This was concurrent with increased transcription of immediate–early genes linked to differentiation such as cdk-5 and NeuroD6, and activity of AP-1 transcription family members such as c-fos, fos-B, and jun-D. Nevertheless, a prolonged activation of the \{P2Y4\} receptor by \{UTP\} also induced cell death, both in naive, differentiated, and P2Y4-transfected SH-SY5Y cells, as measured by direct count of intact nuclei and cytofluorimetric analysis of damaged DNA.

The 1590 most-regulated genes fell into 23 distinct groups of co-regulated genes (regulons). Genes of some regulons are not evenly distributed among the five Arabidopsis chromosomes and pairs of adjacent, co-expressed genes exist. Except regulons 1 and 2, regulons are heterogeneous and consist of genes coding for proteins with different subcellular locations or contributing to several biochemical functions. This implies that different organelles and/or metabolic pathways are co-ordinated at the nuclear transcriptional level, and a prototype for this is regulon 12 which contains genes with functions in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as genes associated with transport or transcription. The co-expression of nuclear genes coding for subunits of the photosystems or encoding proteins involved in the transcription/translation of plastome genes (particularly ribosome polypeptides) (regulons 1 and 2, respectively) implies the existence of a novel mechanism that co-ordinates plastid and nuclear gene expression and involves nuclear control of plastid ribosome abundance. The co-regulation of genes for photosystem and plastid ribosome proteins escapes a previously described general control of nuclear chloroplast proteins imposed by a transcriptional master switch, highlighting a mode of transcriptional regulation of photosynthesis which is different compared to other chloroplast functions. From the evolutionary standpoint, the results provided indicate that functional integration of the proto-chloroplast into the eukaryotic cell was associated with the establishment of different layers of nuclear transcriptional control.}}

Landsystems and process-form models have been applied to a wide range of glaciated basins where they have aided in assessments of the genesis of landform-sediment assemblages, particularly in the ancient terrestrial glacial record. The accuracy of reconstructions of formerly glaciated terrains relies on knowledge of process-form relationships in contemporary glacierized basins. The landsystems approach to terrain classification facilitates a holistic assessment and characterization of glacial landform-sediment associations that can be validated by temporal studies of glacier margins. Historical recession of the Icelandic glaciers allows such studies to be undertaken in a region of uniform climate and lithology and on a selection of glaciers of varying morphology and dynamics. The major landsystems presented in this chapter are valuable modern analogues for reconstructions of ancient ice-marginal environments where glacier morphology, thermal characteristics, and activity were similar to those of present day Iceland.}}

They are studied by means of direct comparison between experimental measurements made in a Jet Stirred Flow Reactor and numerical predictions based on a kinetic scheme developed for general use. Wide ranges of both inlet temperature (875–1275 K) and oxygen/fuel ratio (C/O from 0.01 to 1.4) as well as narrow ranges of dilution (85–90% of nitrogen content) and residence time (0.35–0.5 s) were covered in relation to the identification of regimes either with multiple operating points (hysteresis), steady–unsteady behavior or stable–unstable evolution. It was assessed that the competition between oxidation and recombination channels is stressed under such conditions. The prevalence of acetylene formation and its stabilization with respect to the oxidation of the recombination products is responsible for exothermicity-damping at temperatures higher than 1175 K in rich conditions. This competition is responsible for temperature oscillation modulation in stoichiometric and lean conditions, even though the prevalence of acetylene formation still inhibits temperature increase at temperatures higher than 1300 K. The main practical conclusion derived from this is that diluted combustion processes cannot be designed without a preliminary, accurate analysis of the auto-ignition process. This has thus far been completely ignored for low mass molecular species of interest in natural gas, such as methane. In that case, relatively high air temperatures of above 1400 K must be reached for stable conditions for all air/fuel ratios, whereas temperatures above 1000 K may be high enough only when the richness is more than twice the stoichiometric value. Decreasing both residence time and dilution level in a narrow range of values is beneficial in suppressing temperature oscillations, according to the analysis in terms of inlet temperature and air/fuel ratio.}}

Slow ARC, about 1 min in duration, were revealed from \{D88\} (stage 31) to the near-hatching stages (incubation time was 183–198 days). The frequency and amplitude of slow \{ARC\} increased significantly towards the end of incubation. This \{ARC\} enhancement correlated with the differentiation of smooth muscle elements in the amniotic membrane from single spindle-shaped cells to complex “star-like” structures and with the development of the actin fibers, revealed by phalloidin, in the amniotic muscle layer. Short-term changes in temperature influenced \{ARC\} and heart rate (HR). Cooling to 25 °C from the control (27.5 °C) resulted in a significant decrease in both \{ARC\} frequency and HR.

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the most recent discoveries in the field of vertebrate non-canonical Wnt signaling that point to the existence of a complex non-canonical Wnt signaling network. Wnt proteins constitute a family of secreted glycoproteins that are involved in diverse embryological processes, such as cell differentiation, cell migration, and the establishment of cell polarity These processes are mediated by the activation of different intracellular signaling cascades. The hallmark of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin due to the Wnt-mediated inhibition of GSK3-β and the subsequent relocalization of β-catenin to the nucleus. There, β-catenin regulates target gene expression by forming a complex with members of the TCF/LEF family of \{HMG\} box transcription factors. Most prominent to this pathway is its extensively studied role in the formation of the dorsal-ventral body axis in vertebrates and its function in carcinogenesis. Specific Wnt proteins trigger intracellular Ca2+ release, which activates the calciumsensitive protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase \{II\} (CamKII), the first two calcium-sensitive proteins identified to be regulated by Wnts. The vertebrate Wnt/JNK pathway has been assimilated to represent the planar cell polarity pathway known from Drosophila.}}

Many of the top-level industrial ecology strategies require solutions at the bottom-level of technological processes. At top-level, the industrial system can be seen as a compartment in the global metabolism, in which materials are converted into products, products are accumulated and recycled into materials again. The decreased use of metals in products can affect product recyclability. Which products are recyclable is determined by the development of the collection, separation and metallurgical processes downstream. The changes in the supply and composition of secondary materials resulting from product manufacturing require that metallurgical processes must be able to produce and recycle metals efficiently under continuously changing conditions. The metal wheel visualizes the capacity of metallurgical systems, but provides no information on the dynamic behavior of the system, necessary for effective control of the system. The industrial ecological evolution aims to approach a (type III) ecosystem configuration. In nature, organisms feed and dispose of large amounts materials continuously. These organisms are organized bottom-up into ecosystems to efficiently recycle these materials.}}

Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus bovis II/2 and Gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. Significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) Actinomyces spp. and Veillonella spp.; (2) Actinomyces israelii and Peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) Campylobacter gracilis and Actinomyces spp.; (4) Prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) Fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. The single Candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. Scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. Our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. In particular, Actinomyces spp., Veillonella spp., Prevotella spp. and Fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.}}

Genotyping for the -2518 (A/G) MCP-1 promotor polymorphism showed that \{GG\} homozygotes were significantly more frequent in patients with \{SSc\} than in controls (28%vs 6%). Results of immunohistochemistry revealed that MCP-1 was expressed in keratinocytes, infiltrating inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in scleroderma skin, whereas normal control skin showed no MCP-1 expression. MCP-1 expression in fibroblasts from GG-homozygote individuals tended to be stronger as compared to \{AG\} or \{AA\} genotypes. Furthermore, basal as well as TNF-induced MCP-1 expression of fibroblasts isolated from a GG-homozygote \{SSc\} patient was significantly higher than MCP-1 expression of fibroblasts isolated from heterozygote or AA-homozygote donors.

abstract = {Summary Transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes regulate expression of genetic networks in response to environmental cues. The extracellular signal-activated p38 \{MAP\} kinase (p38) pathway plays a fundamental role in conversion of myoblasts to differentiated myocytes. p38 phosphorylates specific transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins promoting assembly of the myogenic transcriptome. Here, we demonstrate that p38 α and β isoforms also control muscle-gene expression posttranscriptionally, by stabilizing critical myogenic transcripts. KSRP, an important factor for AU-rich element (ARE)-directed mRNA decay, undergoes p38-dependent phosphorylation during muscle differentiation. \{KSRP\} phosphorylated by p38 displays compromised binding to ARE-containing transcripts and fails to promote their rapid decay, although it retains the ability to interact with the mRNA degradation machinery. Overexpression of \{KSRP\} selectively impairs induction of ARE-containing early myogenic transcripts, without affecting p38-mediated transcriptional responses. Our results uncover an unanticipated role for \{KSRP\} in establishing a biochemical link between differentiation-activated p38 signaling and turnover of myogenic mRNAs.}}

The protein-loaded macroscopic gels are obtained by hydration of mixtures of oppositely charged hydroxyethyl methacrylate-derivatized dextran microspheres with a protein solution. In media of low ionic strength (100 mM Hepes pH 7.0) it was found that the release of the entrapped model proteins (lysozyme, \{BSA\} and IgG) was slower than in saline (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Hepes pH 7.0). The reason behind this observation is that substantial adsorption of the proteins onto the microspheres' surface and/or absorption in the microspheres takes place. Confocal images showed that independent of their crosslink density the microspheres are impermeable for \{BSA\} and IgG. BSA, bearing a negative charge at neutral pH, was adsorbed onto the surface of positively charged microspheres. Lysozyme, which is positively charged at neutral pH, was able to penetrate into the negatively charged microspheres. In saline, the gels showed continuous release of the different proteins for 25 to 60 days. Importantly, lysozyme was quantitatively and with full preservation of its enzymatic activity released in about 25 days. This emphasizes the protein friendly technology to prepare the protein-loaded gels. Mathematical modeling revealed that protein release followed Fick's second law, indicating that the systems are primarily diffusion controlled. These results show that these hydrogels are very suitable as injectable matrix for diffusion-controlled delivery of pharmaceutically active proteins.}}

The model describes the pump process both by the Ca 2 + \{ATPase\} itself and by a suitable description of the glycolysis. The associated set of differential equations shows a rich behavior, the solutions ranging from simple periodic oscillations to complex patterns such as bursting and spiking. Recent experimental results on calcium oscillations in Xenopus laevis oocytes and on dynamic patterns of intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations in electrically non-excitable cells are well described by corresponding theoretical results derived within the proposed model. The simulation results are further compared to spontaneous [ Ca 2 + ] oscillations in primitive endodermal cells.}}

Strong climatic and geographic gradients and topographic contrasts have contributed to the marked physiographic heterogeneity of the region. Pollen sites from the Ebro River Basin (northeastern Spain) have been insufficiently studied, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable sites for conventional pollen analyses (i.e. lakes, peatbogs) and the characteristic mosaic vegetation patterns. Glacial and Lateglacial pollen records from a variety of archives located along a N–S transect: Glacial lakes, periglacial screes, peatbogs, hyena coprolites and archaeological sites were analyzed. The reconstruction of full and Lateglacial landscapes in the Ebro River valley provides new insights into the vegetational history of the region: (i) the abundance of steppe formations with Artemisia, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Ephedra, Asteraceae during the most intensive cold-arid episodes in both the non-glaciated mountains and the lowlands, (ii) the continuous occurrence of woody taxa even at high areas, (iii) the expansion of these woody taxa during Lateglacial climatic ameliorations, (iv) the survival of mesothermophytes in small refuge areas during full-glacial stages. There was great vegetation diversity in the northeastern Iberian landscapes during the Last Glacial and Lateglacial stages, suggesting patches of vegetation with steppic areas, Mediterranean shrubs, coniferous forest and refuges of mesothermophilous taxa.}}

Irrespective of the mode of system description, integration determines the hierarchy of the system and hence its effective complexity. Because hierarchy and integration are intrinsic features of ecological systems, they can serve to advance understanding of general properties of such systems. As hierarchical structure affects system assembly and repair, integration becomes a major determinant of such process. To demonstrate potential applications, I develop a quantitative model, grounded in the blind watchmaker analogy. This model shows that while hierarchical organization accords a substantial improvement in ability of a system to assemble or repair itself over a non-hierarchical assembly process, this improvement greatly depends on the interplay among three variables—the probability of perturbation, mean size of the subassembly, and the degree of integration. Specifically, high integration reduces time required to assemble (or repair) a system but it also demands higher levels of modularity (compartmentalization of interactions). In ecological terms, highly integrated systems should evolve towards increased specialization and compartmentalization (low direct connectivity), particularly in habitats where perturbation is locally infrequent.}}

This review provides brief tutorials on the elements of the innate immune system that detect infection, how sleep is characterized in the laboratory, issues regarding the interpretation of sleep effects on immune function, the interaction of sleep with circadian rhythms and stress, and some of the microbial products, cytokines, and neuropeptides associated with sleep regulation.

Regional brain radioactivity served as a marker for relative glucose metabolism. Error rates on the task were related to regional radioactivity and hippocampal morphology. Results Methamphetamine users had higher error rates than control subjects on the vigilance task. The groups showed different relationships between error rates and relative activity in the anterior and middle cingulate gyrus and the insula. Whereas the \{MA\} user group showed negative correlations involving these regions, the control group showed positive correlations involving the cingulate cortex. Across groups, hippocampal metabolic and structural measures were negatively correlated with error rates. Conclusions Dysfunction in the cingulate and insular cortices of recently abstinent \{MA\} abusers contribute to impaired vigilance and other cognitive functions requiring sustained attention.

Several neurochemicals (glutamate, glycine receptors, choline acetyltransferase, serotonin, norepinephrine, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone) increase expression with age, while others (GABA, serotonin receptor 1A, substance P, neurokinin 1 receptor, and somatostatin) decrease their expression. Surprisingly, a dramatic shift occurs at postnatal day (P) 12 in the rat. Excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and its \{NMDA\} receptors fall precipitously, whereas inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, GABAB, and glycine receptors rise sharply. A concomitant drop in cytochrome oxidase activity occurs in respiratory neurons. Several receptor types undergo subunit switches during development. Notably, \{GABAA\} receptors switch prevalence from α3- to an α1-dominant form at \{P12\} in the pre-Bötzinger complex of the rat. The transient dominance of inhibitory over excitatory neurotransmission around \{P12\} may render the respiratory system sensitive to failure when stressed. Relating these neurochemical changes to physiological responses in animals and to sudden infant death syndrome in humans will be a challenge for future research.}}

Based on their chemical composition three types of water were recognized: chloride, sulfate and bicarbonate. However four groups of water were identified on a statistical multi-variable method of cluster analysis (A–D). The average temperature is 25 °C; with a few exceptions in the south where temperature can be as high as 47 °C. Stable isotope ratios for some waters plot close to the world meteoric line, corresponding to the original unaltered waters of the zone. The hydrogeochemistry varies in relation to three principal processes: evaporation, infiltration of water used in agriculture and rock interaction by reaction with evaporitic deposits. Major quartz, calcite and plagioclase and minor smectite, kaolinite, halite, sylvite and gypsum were identified by X-ray diffraction in lacustrine sediments of the central part of the zone. Chemical modeling indicates saturation with respect to calcite and undersaturation with respect to gypsum. By incorporating chemical and isotope data into geological and isopotential well information, a hydrodynamic model has been postulated. In this hydrodynamic model the water (A) enters the study zone from the east and it is originally of the old Colorado River water. The water samples on which the model is based were draw from agricultural wells that intersected two aquifers, a shallow and a deep one, representing the recharge to the zone. The salinity of the deep aquifer water (B) is lower than that of the shallow aquifer water (C) and so is the stable isotope ratio. The difference is though to be due to dissolution of evaporates, evaporation and possible infiltration of spent agriculture water. Both waters then pass through lacustrine sediments and gain in salinity and become isotopically heavier mainly by evaporation in a stagnate flow. They eventually emerge as a saline water (D) in the central part of the study zone. This saline water is the one that mixes with thermal fluid discharges from the geothermal reservoir in the south.}}

Both independent approaches were developed in terms of random-trap or valley model where the disorder of energy landscape is exponentially distributed while the corresponding mean residence times in traps obey the power-law. This type of disorder characterizes several amorphous (even used commercially) materials which makes it possible to apply the \{HCTRF\} formalism.

There was a normal complement of inner and outer hair cells from the hook to the apical region. At P15, slc4a7−/− mice cochlea inner and outer hair cells were still present at the hook region, and vacuoles were seen underneath Hensen's cells. At P21, inner and outer hair cells were degenerated in this region. Between \{P30\} and P90, there was a pronounced loss of hair cells and spiral ganglia neurons. Morphological analysis of the spiral ligament showed a progressive loss of type \{II\} and \{IV\} fibrocytes beginning at day 21. Transmission electron microscopy observations at \{P30\} and \{P90\} revealed that type \{II\} and \{IV\} fibrocytes showed shrinkage and vacuolization. In addition, hair cells were deteriorated with evidence of shrinkage and picnotic nuclei. \{TUNEL\} staining showed apoptotic cells at \{P8\} in the organ of Corti at the basal region of the cochlea. At P15, caspase-3 immunoreactivity was present in supporting cells of the organ of Corti. \{NBC3\} mild immunoreactivity was detected in the organ of Corti at P11. There was an increase in the expression of \{NBC3\} in the spiral ligament between \{P17\} and P19. From \{P21\} to P90, \{NBC3\} expression was confined to the spiral ligament and inner and outer sulcus cells. The vestibular sensory epithelia from slc4a7−/− mice were normal from \{P2\} to P90. Damage of the sensory epithelia at the high frequency zone of the cochlea suggests that \{NBC3\} may play an important physiological role in this region.}}

The degree of phase synchrony or phase coherence between \{EEG\} signals was measured by a recently developed index, which is more suitable than classical indices, like correlation or coherence, when dealing with nonlinear and nonstationary signals like EEG. Comparing the music listening task to rest or control condition, musicians showed increase in phase synchrony over distributed cortical areas, both near and distant, in delta, and most conspicuously in gamma frequency band, whereas non-musicians showed enhancement only in delta band. Further, the degree of phase synchrony in musicians was reduced during listening to text as compared to listening to music. Comparing the two groups during the listening tasks, the clear-cut difference was found in gamma band phase synchrony, which was significantly stronger in musicians while listening to every chosen piece of music, yet no large difference between these two groups was found while listening to the chosen text. Musicians also showed stronger higher order inter-frequency phase synchrony between delta band oscillations in anterior regions and gamma band oscillations in posterior regions. In addition, consistent left hemispheric dominance, in terms of the strength of phase synchrony, was observed in musicians while listening to music, whereas right hemispheric dominance was observed in non-musicians. These results suggest that professional training in music is able to elicit context-sensitive functional connectivity between multiple cortical regions resulting in different listening strategies to music.}}

Cumulus–oocyte complexes were first prematured for 24 h in the presence of different levels of roscovitine (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μM). Roscovitine was shown to block germinal vesicle breakdown in calf oocytes in a concentration dependent manner. Significantly greater inhibitory effect was observed at 50 and 100 μM with 64.6% and 63.2% oocytes being blocked in the germinal vesicle stage when compared to the control (0.0%) and the 12.5 μM (2.9%) and 25 μM (18.8%) groups. However, this inhibitory effect of roscovitine was fully reversible since a substantial number of the oocytes resumed meiosis and reached the metaphase \{II\} stage after a further 24 h of culture in a permissive medium. Cleavage rates and blastocyst yields were not significantly different for oocytes cultured under 50 μM roscovitine inhibition compared to oocytes not subjected to prematuration culture (rates of 76.7% cleavage and 8.7% blastocysts for control oocytes compared to 69.8% and 6.3%, respectively, for oocytes pretreated with 50 μM roscovitine). The morphology of the meiotic spindle was typical of metaphase \{II\} in 75.8% and 82.1% of the oocytes reaching the metaphase \{II\} stage after pretreatment with 50 μM roscovitine compared to control, respectively. A normal distribution of actin filaments was observed in 97.0% and 98.2% of oocytes exposed to 50 μM roscovitine compared to control, respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of maintaining calf oocytes in artificial meiotic arrest without compromising their subsequent developmental competence.}}

In this paper, we explore how probabilistic neural networks fit into the earlier framework of pattern recognition of partial discharge patterns since the \{PD\} patterns are an important tool for diagnosis of \{HV\} insulation systems. Skilled humans can identify the possible insulation defects in various representations of partial discharge (PD) data. One of the most widely used representation is phase resolved \{PD\} (PRPD) patterns. Also this paper describes a method for the automated recognition of \{PRPD\} patterns using a novel complex probabilistic neural network system for the actual classification task. The efficacy of composite neural network developed using probabilistic neural network is examined.}}

The amide bond(s) were stable to cold acid and alkali (2 M \{TFA\} and 0.1 M NaOH at 25 °C) but rapidly hydrolysed by these agents at 100 °C. The amide bond(s) were resistant to Driselase and to all proteinases tested, although Driselase digested GalAn–Put, releasing fragments such as GalA3–Put–GalA3. To trace the possible formation of GalA–polyamine amide bonds in vivo, we fed Arabidopsis and rose cell-cultures and chickpea internodes with [14C]Put. About 20% of the 14C taken up was released as 14CO2, indicating some catabolism. An additional ∼73% of the 14C taken up (in Arabidopsis), or ∼21% (in rose), became ethanol-insoluble, superficially suggestive of polysaccharide–Put covalent bonding. However, much of the ethanol-inextractable 14C was subsequently extractable by acidified phenol or by cold 1 M TFA. The small proportion of radioactive material that stayed insoluble in both phenol and \{TFA\} was hydrolysable by Driselase or hot 6 M HCl, yielding 14C-oligopeptides and/or amino acids (including Asp, Glu, Gly, Ala and Val); no free 14C-polyamines were released by hot HCl. We conclude that if pectin–polyamine amide bonds are present, they are a very minor component of the cell walls of cultured rose and Arabidopsis cells and chickpea internodes.}}

A new, simplified and overarching theory of noradrenaline function is inspired by an invertebrate model: neuromodulators in crustacea abruptly interrupt activity in neural networks and reorganize the elements into new functional networks determining the behavioral output. Analogously in mammals, phasic activation of noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus in time with cognitive shifts could provoke or facilitate dynamic reorganization of target neural networks, permitting rapid behavioral adaptation to changing environmental imperatives. Detailed analysis and discussion of extensive electrophysiological data from the locus coeruleus of rats and monkeys in controlled behavioral situations is provided here to support this view. This simplified ‘new look’ at locus coeruleus noradrenaline function redirects the challenge of understanding neuromodulatory systems towards their target networks, particularly to the dynamics of their interactions and how they organize adaptive behavior.}}

In an earlier publication, committee members were trained on different subsets of the training set to ensure enough diversity for improved committee performance. In situations characterized by high data dimensionality, i.e. a large number of features and a relatively few training examples, it may be more advantageous to split the feature set rather than the training set. We describe a novel approach for tentatively ranking the features and forming subsets of uniform predictive quality for training individual members. The abductive network training algorithm is used to select optimum predictors from the feature set at various levels of model complexity specified by the user. Using the resulting tentative ranking, the features are grouped into mutually exclusive subsets of approximately equal predictive power for training the members. The approach is demonstrated on three standard medical diagnosis datasets (breast cancer, heart disease, and diabetes). Three-member committees trained on different feature subsets and using simple output combination methods reduce classification errors by up to 20% compared to the best single model developed with the full feature set. Results are compared with those reported previously with members trained through splitting the training set. Training abductive committee members on feature subsets of approximately equal predictive power achieves both diversity and quality for improved committee performance. Ensemble feature subset selection can be performed using GMDH-based learning algorithms. The approach should be advantageous in situations characterized by high data dimensionality.}}

The mechanical strength and Young's modulus of geopolymers synthesized by the alkali activation of metakaolin with Si/Al ratio between 1.15 and 2.15 are correlated with their respective microstructures through \{SEM\} analysis. The microstructure of specimens is observed to be highly porous for Si/Al ratios ≤1.40 but largely homogeneous for Si/Al ≥1.65, and mechanistic arguments explaining the change in microstructure based on speciation of the alkali silicate activating solutions are presented. All specimens with a homogeneous microstructure exhibit an almost identical Young's modulus, suggesting that the Young's modulus of geopolymers is determined largely by the microstructure rather than simply through compositional effects as has been previously assumed. The strength of geopolymers is maximized at Si/Al = 1.90. Specimens with higher Si/Al ratio exhibit reduced strength, contrary to predictions based on compositional arguments alone. The decrease in strength with higher silica content has been linked to the amount of unreacted material in the specimens, which act as defect sites. This work demonstrates that the microstructures of geopolymers can be tailored for specific applications.}}

The ligands bind to the \{CK2\} active site in a different way with respect to the parent compound TBB. They enter more deeply into the cavity, establishing halogen bonds with the backbone of Glu114 and Val116 in the hinge region. A detailed analysis of the interactions highlights a major role of the hydrophobic effect in establishing the rank of potency within this class of inhibitors and shows that polar interactions are responsible for the different orientation of the molecules in the active site.}}

Steady state experiments enable to study butane transport for different concentration profiles in the pores. Measurements of liquid fluxes are indispensable for the evaluation of the presence of condensate in pores during gas permeation. Differences between the gas flux (at both sides of the membrane the butane is in the gas phase) and the liquid butane flux (on the high pressure side of the membrane is liquid, on the opposite side is gas) were observed for the same pressure gradients across the membrane. The differences between these fluxes decrease with decreasing pressure gradients. For a pressure gradient higher than 2 bar the flux of the liquid butane is approximately two times higher, for a pressure gradient of 1.3 bar the ratio of liquid and gas fluxes decreases to 1.7. No difference between liquid and gas fluxes was registered for the lowest pressure gradient investigated (pressures on the two sides of the membrane: 2.22 and 1.91 bar). From the results obtained it can be concluded that the condensation of butane in pores occurs at high pressures on both sides if simultaneously the pressure difference is small.}}

The data on activity suggest that the rate of deactivation slows down beyond a certain mileage. Attention was focused on the changes brought about by mileage in the textural properties, the deposition of contaminants (mainly P, Zn and Pb), the alteration of the reducibility of Ce oxide and the formation of phases between contaminants and washcoat components (CePO4 and Zn2P2O7). The results were compared with those from a fresh counterpart catalyst. The dependence of all the above effects on mileage and the impact on the deactivation of catalytic activity is discussed critically. It is suggested that although other effects may play a secondary role in the used \{TWC\} catalysts studied in this work Pb poisoning exerts a definitive impact on the deactivation of the catalytic activity.}}

The approach requires only limited experimental data and thus allows for systematic parameter studies. The method is based on the determination of the purity-performance characteristic of the \{SMB\} process and rigorous application of mass balances. The use of relative mass fluxes allows derivation of simple algebraic expressions for essential process parameters. The significant potential of combining \{SMB\} and crystallisation is demonstrated for the example of the separation of mandelic acid enantiomers.}}

The traditional linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis that have been successful in the identification of genes responsible for Mendelian traits, however, have not led to similar success in discovering genes influencing the development of complex diseases. Emerging functional genomic and proteomic (‘omic’) resources and technologies provide great opportunities to develop new methods for systematic identification of genes underlying complex diseases. In this report, we propose a systems biology approach, which integrates omic data, to find genes responsible for complex diseases. This approach consists of five steps: (1) generate a set of candidate genes using gene–gene interaction data sets; (2) reconstruct a genetic network with the set of candidate genes from gene expression data; (3) identify differentially regulated genes between normal and abnormal samples in the network; (4) validate regulatory relationship between the genes in the network by perturbing the network using \{RNAi\} and monitoring the response using RT-PCR; and (5) genotype the differentially regulated genes and test their association with the diseases by direct association studies. To prove the concept in principle, the proposed approach is applied to genetic studies of the autoimmune disease scleroderma or systemic sclerosis.}}

In this work, thermal and pH stability of such enzyme were investigated in a lacteous buffer containing 50 g L−1 lactose. Temperatures ranged from 60 to 110 °C while pH values cover the pH range for the potential application of the enzyme to hydrolyse lactose in dairy industry: from 3 to 4 of the acid whey to 6.5 of milk, as well as the basic pH used for immobilisation–stabilisation of the enzyme. Thermal inactivation kinetics followed two trends depending on the temperature range: from 60 to 90 °C an increase in the activity as the temperature rises was followed by its final decrease to a slightly active species; however, at higher temperatures follows a simple exponential trend with no residual activity. A kinetic model involving two consecutive first-order reactions with residual activity was chosen for the first temperature range, and a simple first-order reaction model was taken for the higher temperature range. With pH, again, two different tendencies were observed: a biphasic behaviour in the acidic range with final stabilisation of the activity depending on the pH value and a two-stage behaviour in the neutral-basic range, with a fast deactivation followed by a certain reactivation. As in the case of lower temperatures, a two first-order reaction kinetic model with residual activity fits deactivation data. The known presence of aggregates in initial enzyme preparations suggests inactivation routes where an initial disruption of aggregates leads to trimers, which are finally broken or reorganization of the aggregates.}}

abstract = {Neuronal identities are specified by the combinatorial functions of activators and repressors of gene expression. Members of the well-conserved Olf/EBF (O/E) transcription factor family have been shown to play important roles in neuronal and non-neuronal development and differentiation. O/E proteins are highly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, and O/E binding sites have been identified upstream of olfactory genes. However, the roles of O/E proteins in sensory neuron development are unclear. Here we show that the O/E protein UNC-3 is required for subtype specification of the \{ASI\} chemosensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. UNC-3 promotes an \{ASI\} identity by directly repressing the expression of alternate neuronal programs and by activating expression of ASI-specific genes including the daf-7 TGF-β gene. Our results indicate that UNC-3 is a critical component of the transcription factor code that integrates cell-intrinsic developmental programs with external signals to specify sensory neuronal identity and suggest models for O/E protein functions in other systems.}}

Five cross section shapes are used. The reference cross section S 0 is slightly elliptic (ellipticity of 1.005). Four cross section shapes, which mimic collapsed vessels in an uniformly frozen state, are defined according to the curvature of their opposite faces (the mid-face is located on the minor axis) S q (parallel faces), S t (face folding), S c (point contact between faces) and S ℓ (line contact). These four selected cross shapes are characterized by large changes in both the cross sectional shape and area with respect to S 0 . The cross shapes are obtained from the computation of the deformation under uniform transmural pressures, without extension, of a thin-walled conduit of infinite length and of homogeneous purely elastic walls of constant thickness. The Navier–Stokes equations are solved using the finite element method for the five tubes ∑ 0 , ∑ q , ∑ t , ∑ c and ∑ ℓ , which are associated with S 0 , S q , S t , S c and S ℓ , respectively. The numerical tests are performed with the same value of the volume flow rate whatever the tube configuration for three Reynolds numbers ( R e 0 = 35 , 500 and 1000). The present work is aimed at studying the pressure field for the design of the flow chamber in which endothelial cells are cultured. This field is used not only to define a new relative pressure index to determine the entry length but also to estimate the wall shear stress when the flow is fully developed.}}

Signaling molecules, including secreted basement membrane molecules, derived from the mesenchyme of the gut wall play an important role in the colonization and/or differentiation of the enteric nervous system. The current study aims to define the possible alterations of laminins involved in the pathogenesis of HD. Expression of the various laminin α, β, and γ chains, was assessed in the aganglionic, transitional, and ganglionic bowel segments of patients with \{HD\} or with other motor disorders. Cytoskeletal, neuronal, and glial markers were also included in this study. The major finding highlighted by the present work concerns the clear identification and location of myenteric aganglionic plexuses in \{HD\} with some of the laminin antibodies, which reveal a peripheral nerve type of differentiation. Furthermore, we could show an increase of laminin α5 chain immunostaining in the dilated muscle of the ganglionic bowel upstream the distal aganglionic region in a subgroup of patients with HD, as well as a relocalization of laminin α2 chain in the subepithelial basement membrane. Overall, these basement membrane molecules could provide useful markers for diagnosis of aganglionosis or hypoganglionosis.}}

However, there are clearly additional facets to the physiological role of AGRP, given that it is active in \{MC4R\} knockout mice and it has strikingly long-lasting effects on food intake, compared with \{MC4R\} agonists. In this review we focus on: (i) evidence that \{AGRP\} is more sensitive to perturbations in energy balance than \{POMC\} and is therefore the primary basis of melanocortinergic regulation. (ii) Evidence that the bioactive peptide AGRP83–132, acts by alternate mechanism(s) to elicit its long-term effects on food intake. (iii) Evidence that \{AGRP\} is post-translationally cleaved to generate AGRP83–132 and one or more N terminal peptides, which may have an important physiological role(s) that are independent of the melanocortin system. A clear understanding of how proAGRP processing is regulated, and the role of resultant peptides, may define additional therapeutic targets in the treatment of obesity.}}

We report here that the putative coronin homologue identified in the Leishmania genome is invariably associated with the filament-like structures of actin in Leishmania promastigotes. The occurrence of filamentous structures is significantly increased upon overexpression of Leishmania coronin as its \{GFP\} fusion product in Leishmania cells. However, expression of Leishmania actin or coronin alone in mammalian cells does not result in formation of any filament-like structures of Leishmania actin or association of Leishmania coronin with mammalian filamentous actin, but coexpression of both the proteins in these cells leads to formation of filamentous structures containing Leishmania actin and coronin. The high specificity of Leishmania coronin for Leishmania actin could be attributed to its unique structure as it differs from other coronins not only in the unique region but also in the actin-binding site and leucine zipper motif. These results taken together indicate that Leishmania contains a novel form of coronin which colocalizes with actin in filament-like structures in these cells.}}

On the other hand, cholecystokinin (CCK-8) strongly enhances the withdrawal response. In this study, we have shown that the adenosine \{A1\} antagonist 8-cyclopenthyl-1,3-dimethylxantine (CPT) increased the withdrawal response in dermorphin/naloxone (NLX) tests but lacked any effect if the withdrawal tests were carried out in presence of CCK-8. In tissue preparations coming from a same animal both \{CPT\} and the κ-opioid antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (BNI), increased the intensity of the withdrawal responses; the effects of the two antagonists were additive. The intensity of withdrawal contractile responses in presence of CCK-8 was similar to those obtained in presence of the two antagonists. Tissue preparations tested with dermorphin/CCK-8/NLX and then washed out yielded contractile responses when subsequently challenged with CPT, \{BNI\} or \{BNI\} + CPT, with a percentage markedly higher than the percentage of the response to \{NLX\} challenge. \{BNI\} + \{CPT\} also increased the intensity of the response to \{NLX\} challenge. These data suggest that acute exposure of \{GPI\} to dermorphin induces the activation of both the adenosine \{A1\} and κ-opioid systems, which in turns inhibit the μ-withdrawal response. CCK-8 antagonises the inhibitory effect of the indirectly activated systems.}}

In addition, blood glucose levels (BGLs), along a glucose tolerance test, and plasma concentrations of insulin, leptin, cholesterol, triglycerides and urate were determined in cytokine treated and control rats. Short-term \{FI\} was suppressed after orbitofrontal cortical or peripheral application of IL-1β. In the long-term FI, however, there was no significant difference among the groups. Cytokine microinjection into the OBF, similar to the i.p. administration, was also followed by a significant increase in BT. Pretreatment with P failed to influence the anorexigenic and hyperthermic effects of the centrally administered IL-1β. The sugar load led to a diabetes-like prolonged elevation of \{BGL\} in the IL-1β treated animals. Following cytokine administration, plasma levels of insulin and that of triglycerides were found decreased, whereas that of uric acid increased. The present findings confirm that the \{OBF\} is one of the neural routes through which IL-1β exerts modulatory effect on the central homeostatic regulation.}}

Now, however, they are being used as front ends to object recognition systems, and in particular to appearance-based recognition systems. As such, they need to be evaluated by other criteria. We argue that to serve as effective front ends for object recognition, selective attention systems should (1) select fixation points in scale as well as position, and (2) be insensitive to 2D similarity transformations of the image (i.e., in-plane translations, rotations, reflections, and scales). This paper evaluates the Neuromorphic Vision Toolkit (NVT), a well-known selective attention system, and finds that it satisfies neither criterion. Further investigation, however, suggests that the sensitivity of \{NVT\} to similarity transformation is an artifact of its implementation. We develop a new system, called selective attention as a front end (SAFE), that is based on the same principles as NVT, but selects both the scale and position of fixation points and is largely invariant to 2D similarity transformations.}}

abstract = {Summary Background: The initiation of a cleavage furrow is essential to separate cells during cytokinesis, but little is known about the mechanisms controlling this actin-driven process. Previous studies in C. elegans embryos revealed that inactivation of the CUL-3-based \{E3\} ligase activator rfl-1 results in an aberrant microtubule network, ectopic furrowing during pronuclear migration, and defects during cytokinesis. Results: Here, we show that MEL-26, a substrate-specific adaptor of the CUL-3-based \{E3\} ligase, is required for efficient cell separation and cleavage furrow ingression during the C. elegans early mitotic divisions. Loss of MEL-26 function leads to delayed onset and slow ingression of cytokinesis furrows that frequently regress. Conversely, increased levels of MEL-26 in cul-3(RNAi) and rfl-1 mutant embryos cause a hypercontractile cortex, with several simultaneously ingressing furrows during pronuclear migration. MEL-26 accumulates at cleavage furrows and binds the actin-interacting protein POD-1. Importantly, POD-1 is not a substrate of the MEL-26/CUL-3 ligase but is required to localize MEL-26 to the cortex. Conclusions: Our results suggest that MEL-26 not only acts as a substrate-specific adaptor within the MEL-26/CUL-3 complex, but also promotes cytokinesis by a CUL-3- and microtubule-independent mechanism.}}

Recent transcriptome analysis and different experimental approaches have identified a surprisingly large number of non-coding \{RNAs\} (ncRNAs) in eukaryotic cells. ncRNAs comprise microRNAs, anti-sense transcripts and other Transcriptional Units containing a high density of stop codons and lacking any extensive “Open Reading Frame”. They have been shown to regulate gene expression by novel mechanisms such as \{RNA\} interference, gene co-suppression, gene silencing, imprinting and \{DNA\} demethylation. It is becoming clear that these novel \{RNAs\} perform critical functions during development and cell differentiation. There is also mounting evidence of their involvement in cancer and neurological diseases. Together, all this information indicates that ncRNAs are emerging as a new class of functional transcripts in eukaryotes. Therefore, great challenges lie in the years ahead: understanding the molecular biology of higher organisms will require revealing all proteins (Proteome), all ncRNAs (RNome) and their interactions (Interactome) in the complex molecular scenario within eukaryotic cells.}}

These components are part of a variable interaction structure in a spatially heterogeneous context. The components of ecological interaction networks can give rise to self-organised, and scale-dependent interaction patterns and processes, which are the underlying causes of the overall ecological systems states. The individual-based modelling approach provides a widely applicable simulation framework based on a ‘hierarchy theory’ view of ecological systems. Here, we summarise and generalise the theoretical implications of the modelling studies presented in this volume in the field of terrestrial and aquatic, animal and plant ecology. The case studies cover a representative profile of processes related to ecological applications, such as food web interactions, population dynamics, dispersal, energy physiology, nutrient allocation and mutual impact of morphological and physiological development. The generic approach applied in this context allows a hierarchical representation of ecological systems and their components. Model results are obtained as self-organised structural relation networks and as aggregated quantitative states. In order to address different model characteristics we distinguish collective and emergent properties. Collective properties are those that are attributed equally to different organisation levels of the system. Emergent properties result from the activities of lower level entities on a higher organisation level, while not being present on the lower level. They can be subdivided into aggregational and connective properties. Emergent properties that are aggregational are those which emerge as a result of an aggregation procedure by an observer on the higher level which does not make sense or is not applicable on lower levels. Emergent properties that are connective, however, are based on an interaction network of lower level entities, which brings about the specific system characteristic. This classification of model results will allow to generalise the achievements and potential of the individual-based modelling approach in ecology.}}

abstract = {Pteridine reductase (PTR1) is an NADPH-dependent short-chain reductase found in parasitic trypanosomatid protozoans. The enzyme participates in the salvage of pterins and represents a target for the development of improved therapies for infections caused by these parasites. A series of crystallographic analyses of Leishmania major \{PTR1\} are reported. Structures of the enzyme in a binary complex with the cofactor NADPH, and ternary complexes with cofactor and biopterin, 5,6-dihydrobiopterin, and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin reveal that \{PTR1\} does not undergo any major conformational changes to accomplish binding and processing of substrates, and confirm that these molecules bind in a single orientation at the catalytic center suitable for two distinct reductions. Ternary complexes with cofactor and \{CB3717\} and trimethoprim (TOP), potent inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, respectively, have been characterized. The structure with \{CB3717\} reveals that the quinazoline moiety binds in similar fashion to the pterin substrates/products and dominates interactions with the enzyme. In the complex with TOP, steric restrictions enforced on the trimethoxyphenyl substituent prevent the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine moiety from adopting the pterin mode of binding observed in dihydrofolate reductase, and explain the inhibition properties of a range of pyrimidine derivates. The molecular detail provided by these complex structures identifies the important interactions necessary to assist the structure-based development of novel enzyme inhibitors of potential therapeutic value.}}

A 99% purification of GFP+ cells was achieved. When transplanted into 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rat striatum, \{PDN\} survived, became well-integrated and produced recovery from amphetamine-induced motor behaviors. However, when grown in culture, \{PDN\} died within days of plating. No known growth factors prevented \{PDN\} death as did incubation with novel factors in glia/glial-conditioned media. We conclude that GFP-tagged \{DA\} neurons can be purified to homogeneity and can survive and function when grown with glial factors in vitro or after transplantation in vivo.}}

Two design alternatives for energy efficient distributed image compression are proposed and investigated with respect to energy consumption and image quality. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme prolongs the system lifetime at a normalized total energy consumption comparable to the centralized image compression.}}

We show in this study that, in zebrafish, sox4, a member of the SRY-like HMG-box (SOX) family, is required for proper endocrine cell differentiation. We found that two genes orthologous to mammalian Sox4 are present in zebrafish and that only one of them, sox4b, is strongly expressed in the pancreatic anlage. Transcripts of sox4b were detected in mid-trunk endoderm from the 5-somite stage, well before the onset of expression of the early pancreatic gene pdx-1. Furthermore, by fluorescent double in situ hybridization, we found that expression of sox4b is mostly restricted to precursors of the endocrine compartment. This expression is not maintained in differentiated cells although transient expression can be detected in α cells and some β cells. That sox4b-expressing cells belong to the endocrine lineage is further illustrated by their absence from the pancreata of slow-muscle-omitted mutant embryos, which specifically lack all early endocrine markers while retaining expression of exocrine markers. The involvement of sox4b in cell differentiation is suggested firstly by its up-regulation in mind bomb mutant embryos displaying accelerated pancreatic cell differentiation. In addition, sox4b knock-down leads to a drastic reduction in glucagon expression, while other pancreatic markers including insulin, somatostatin, and trypsin are not significantly affected. This disruption of α cell differentiation is due to down-regulation of the homeobox arx gene specifically in the pancreas. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in zebrafish, sox4b is expressed transiently during endocrine cell differentiation and plays a crucial role in the generation of α endocrine cells.}}

As marine food webs are fished down, these small pelagics tend to be more exploited and overfished. It is not yet very well known what the possible effects of their collapse can be, therefore there is an urgent need to outline a theoretical framework for understanding their dynamics. These fish occupy very special position in food webs, ensuring energy transfer between species lower and higher levels, while forming narrow “wasp-waists” poor in number of species (but very abundant). Our purpose was to quantify the interaction structure of model food webs of equal complexity but different levels of “wasp-waistedness”. We analysed the topological properties of the webs by characterising every direct and indirect interactions between individual species, as well as by assessing the relative positional importance of each species in each web. We found that (1) the shorter the interaction pathways considered, the weaker the predictive power of node degree for positional importance, (2) the importance of species varies more in wasp-waist food webs, (3) if longer indirect chain effects are considered, indirect effects can well be stronger than direct ones, (4) interactions between coexisting wasp-waist species are stronger than the average, and (5) the “self-regulatory” looping effects are also stronger for wasp-waist species. Based on the topological properties of the networks, our results describe constraints acting on the dynamical behaviour of wasp-waist ecosystems. We give explanations, from this viewpoint, for regime shifts in which one \{WW\} species replaces another, and for the unpredictable dynamics of these fish stocks. From a marine conservation viewpoint, we illustrate that as the abundance of wasp-waist species decreases, the architecture of energy flows becomes highly vulnerable and unreliable. We provide an approach for quantifying these structural changes.}}

Some markers labeled by various authors as either “neural” or “non-neural” indeed show ectodermal expression patterns roughly correlative with widespread yet vague ideas on the shape and size of the early neural plate, based on previous fate maps. However, for technical reasons, it is not clear how precisely these expression patterns correlate with any experimentally determined fate boundaries. An eventual mismatch between fate and marker interpretation might bear importantly on ideas about gene functions and causal hypotheses in issues such as the establishment of the neural/non-neural border or the earliest mechanisms of neural regionalization. In this review, we correlated a set of epiblastic and mesendodermal gene expression patterns with the novel neuroectoderm proportions suggested by our recent fate map of the chick neural plate at stages \{HH\} 3d/4 [P. Fernández-Garre, L. Rodriguez-Gallardo, V. Gallego-Diaz, I.S. Alvarez, L. Puelles, Fate map of the chicken neural plate at stage 4, Development 129 (2002) 2807–2822.]. This analysis suggests the existence of various nested subregions of the epiblast with boundaries codefined by given sets of gene patterns. No gene expression studied reproduces exactly or even approximately the entire neural plate shape, leading to a combinatorial hypothesis on its specification. This kind of analysis (fate and molecular maps), jointly with competence maps, provides the basis for understanding gene functions and the mechanisms of neural induction, specification and regionalization. Several gene patterns observed are consistent with precocious incipient regionalization of the neural plate along the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes.}}

With this aim, lithium lubricating greases were prepared by inducing the saponification reaction between 12-hydroxystearic acid and hydrated lithium hydroxide within a naphtenic lubricating oil medium, applying a controlled-temperature programme. The manufacturing process was followed through the mixing rheometry technique by measuring the evolution of torque with processing time. Samples of incipient and finished grease were taken from the stirred tank at different processing times. Rheological (linear viscoelasticity and viscous flow) and mechanical stability tests, as well as morphological studies, were carried out on each sample. The changes found in the microstructure and rheology of a lubricating grease during its processing have been related to the soap concentration in the reacting mixture, the waxy soap transition at high temperatures and the further cooling steps. From the experimental results obtained, we may conclude that a suitable lithium lubricating grease is a highly structured system, based on the development of a three-dimensional network due to the presence of metallic soap crystallites.}}

Lack of attention to the gender dimension of fisheries management can result in policy interventions missing their target of creating sustainable livelihoods at the community level. There is little doubt that fishing-dependent communities have a vital role to play in the overall development process of many coastal West African States, but without a complete understanding of the complexity of gender roles, the goal of sustainable livelihoods is unlikely to be achieved. In a bid to improve knowledge about gender roles in fishing communities, and to provide policy makers with some guidance as to where interventions might be most useful, a workshop was held in Cotonou, Benin (West Africa) in December 2003. This paper provides a brief introduction to the theory on gender and fisheries development and then goes on to report the findings of the workshop. The most significant conclusion is that policy interventions which help strengthen institutional capacity in coastal artisanal communities would have the greatest over all impact. A move toward collecting gender and fisheries disaggregated data would also help expand existing knowledge about what are often marginal and isolated economic sectors.}}

Telomerase activity is critically involved in cell development, ageing and tumourigenesis. Activation of telomerase to maintain telomeres is required for self renewal and proliferative expansion of a number of cell types, including stem cells, activated lymphocytes and cancerous cells. However, recent studies show that the safeguard mechanisms and the modes of regulation of telomerase are more revealing than thought under various physiological and pathological conditions. Considerable evidence suggests that hormones and growth factors are crucially involved in regulating telomerase activity and gene expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). This review briefly summarises our current understanding of how hormones and growth factors regulate the telomerase and telomere network and how deregulation can induce ageing and related diseases such as cancer.}}

One alternative for restoration of tidal freshwater marsh ecosystems is to reconnect regions currently managed for agricultural purposes to the adjacent rivers and sloughs. Two elements of such restoration efforts that have not been adequately addressed are the impact that restoration efforts are likely to impose on flood stages, and the extent of various habitat types that may develop. This study tests the hypothesis that habitat restoration and flood mitigation can be compatible. \{MIKE\} 11, a one-dimensional, unsteady hydraulic model is used to evaluate the flood stage impacts of five restoration scenarios for the McCormack-Williamson Tract, located in the northern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, USA. In addition to quantifying flood impacts, model results are used to quantify the volume of tidal exchange, and integrated with \{GIS\} to quantify the potential areal extent of subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal habitat zones within the project. The results indicate that the restoration would provide a mosaic of habitat types, and have a minimal adverse impact upon flood stages during a range of flooding conditions.}}

Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the \{EEG\} is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities, and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. Through wavelet decomposition of the \{EEG\} records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of \{EEG\} signals using discrete wavelet transform, and classification using ANN. \{EEG\} signals were decomposed into the frequency sub-bands using wavelet transform. Then these sub-band frequencies were used as an input to an \{ANN\} with two discrete outputs: normal and epileptic. In this study, \{FEBANN\} and \{DWN\} based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of \{EEG\} signals. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the \{ROC\} curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The DWN-based classifier outperformed the \{FEBANN\} based counterpart. Within the same group, the DWN-based classifier was more accurate than the FEBANN-based classifier.}}

Molecular modeling studies suggested that sphingosine can adopt two distinct conformations: a high-energy “snake-like” conformer in water and an extended low-energy conformer in lipid phases. We propose that the energy stored in the compressed snake-like conformer is transformed into kinetic energy, allowing: (i) the motion of sphingosine through the unstirred water layer bathing the mucosal enterocyte surface, and (ii) its insertion into the enterocyte brush border membrane. Dietary lipids that stabilized the extended sphingosine conformer in mixed micelles (e.g., cholesterol and sphingomyelin) induced a marked inhibition of sphingosine absorption.}}

The system displays a phase transition in the final hostility proportion depending on the initial amity possibility. We can further define the strength of vertices to describe the individual popularity, which exhibits nonlinear evolution. Meanwhile, various nonrandom perturbations to the initial system have been investigated, and simulation results are in accord with common real-life observations.}}

These characterise the dynamics of the market. Four hitherto unnoticed effects have been found that are difficult to explain from simple econometric models. These effects are: (1) the noise level in baseline sales is much higher than can be expected for uncorrelated sales events; (2) weekly baseline sales differences are distributed according to a broad non-Gaussian function with fat tails; (3) these fluctuations follow a Lévy distribution of exponent α = 1.4 , similar to financial exchange markets and in stock markets; and (4) this noise is correlated over a period of 10–11 weeks, or shows an apparent power law spectrum. The similarity to stock markets suggests that models developed to describe these markets may be applied to describe the collective behaviour of consumers.}}

These antigen-independent mechanisms constitute innate immunity. Antimicrobial peptides are released at epithelial surfaces and disrupt the membranes of many microbial pathogens. Toll-like receptors on epithelial cells and leukocytes recognize a range of microbial molecular patterns and generate intracellular signals for activation of a range of host responses. Cytokines released from leukocytes and other cells exhibit a vast array of regulatory functions in both adaptive and innate immunity. Chemokines released from infected tissues recruit diverse populations of leukocytes that express distinct chemokine receptors. Natural killer cells recognize and bind virus-infected host cells and tumor cells and induce their apoptosis. Complement, through the alternative and mannose-binding lectin pathways, mediates antibody-independent opsonization, phagocyte recruitment, and microbial lysis. Phagocytes migrate from the microcirculation into infected tissue and ingest and kill invading microbes. These innate immune mechanisms and their interactions in defense against infection provide the host with the time needed to mobilize the more slowly developing mechanisms of adaptive immunity, which might protect against subsequent challenges.}}

This survey confirms that the research on \{ERP\} systems is still a growing field, but has reached some maturity. Different research communities address this area from various points of view.

Methods This technique is capable of displaying a few thousand polypeptide chains, characterized by a single pI and Mr value as coordinates, and recognized via elution, digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. Although, up to the present, this technique has been used mostly for advanced research, with no immediate applications in the clinical chemistry laboratory, there are hints that such applications will soon become a reality. Results and conclusions In the field of cancer research, it is here shown that stathmin (Op18) becomes heavily phosphorylated in cancerous mantle cell lymphomas and that the progression of the disease can be followed by the progression of phosphorylation of Op18 and by the appearance of additional phosphorylated spots. Also chemoresistance of different tumors has been evaluated via 2D-PAGE through quantitative, differential proteomics: among up- and down-regulated proteins in a human cervix squamous cell carcinoma cell line (A431), rendered resistant to cisplatin, one particular protein was found to appear in large quantities by de novo synthesis: 14–3–3, a protein known to impart resistance to apoptosis to cells. In the field of brain disorders, we could set up an easy test for detecting pathological prions in sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD), by simply searching for those pathological forms in the olfactory mucosa (up to this finding, diagnosis could only be confirmed post-mortem). We are currently working on a test for differentiating sCJD from all the other degenerative dementias. Upon 2D mapping of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and immunoblot analysis, we could identify a major spot (pI 4.8, Mr 30 kDa) followed by some two–three minor spots (pIs 5.0–6.0, same Mr value) of the same 14–3–3 anti-apoptotic protein involved in chemoresistance. By this test, sCJD could be differentiated from all the other degenerative dementias, which are 14–3–3 negative (in sCJD, the rapid and massive brain cell damage releases large quantities of 14–3–3 in the cerebrospinal fluid). Another protein that appears very promising as a marker for sCJD is cystatin C, that is strongly up-regulated in this pathology. Human sera should also be mined for discovery of many more markers for disease. Up to the present, no one could be found, but this was due to the presence of several major proteins, obscuring all rare ones. Via several immuno-subtraction steps, followed by ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, one can now detect proteins and peptides present in sera at levels below 10 ng/mL, highlighting the road to discovery of novel markers of disease. Another technique that could revolutionize biomarker discovery in biological fluids consists in the use of combinatorial beads to reduce the dynamic range. They consist in a library of combinatorial ligands coupled to small beads. Such a library comprises hexameric ligands composed of amino acids, resulting in millions different structures. When these beads are impregnated with complex proteomes (e.g., human sera, CSF, urines) of widely differing protein compositions, they are able to significantly reduce the concentration differences, thus greatly enhancing the possibility of evidencing low-abundance species.}}

The fugu \{TERT\} (fTERT) gene comprises of 16 exons and 15 introns similar to the human \{TERT\} (hTERT), and encodes a 1074 amino acid protein. The fTERT protein showed 33% to 35% sequence identity to other vertebrate TERTs, and contained all the signature motifs of the \{TERT\} family. Analysis of the promoter region of fTERT showed the presence of several transcription factor binding sites (E2F-1, E-box, ER, Sp1 and \{USF\} sites) in common with the hTERT promoter, and whose binding factors are known to regulate hTERT. The fTERT gene is expressed in a variety of tissues, with high expression detected in the gill, testis, and ovary. fTERT expression was detected in an immortalized fugu eye-derived cell line. The level of expression was found to be higher in actively dividing cells and reduced at quiescence, suggesting cell cycle regulation of \{TERT\} and possibly telomerase activity, in this cell line.}}

We inactivated the murine TIF-IA gene by homologous recombination in mice and embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). TIF-IA−/− embryos die before or at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), displaying retardation of growth and development. In MEFs, Cre-mediated depletion of TIF-IA leads to disruption of nucleoli, cell cycle arrest, upregulation of p53, and induction of apoptosis. Elevated levels of p53 after TIF-IA depletion are due to increased binding of ribosomal proteins, such as L11, to \{MDM2\} and decreased interaction of \{MDM2\} with p53 and p19ARF. RNAi-induced loss of p53 overcomes proliferation arrest and apoptosis in response to TIF-IA ablation. The striking correlation between perturbation of nucleolar function, elevated levels of p53, and induction of cell suicide supports the view that the nucleolus is a stress sensor that regulates p53 activity.}}

abstract = {The Ecuadorian Amazon, one of the richest reserves of biodiversity in the world, has faced one of the highest rates of deforestation of any Amazonian nation. Most of this forest elimination has been caused by agricultural colonization that followed the discovery of oil fields in 1967. Since the 1990s, an increasing process of urbanization has also engendered new patterns of population mobility within the Amazon, along with traditional ways by which rural settlers make their living. However, while very significant in its effects on deforestation, urbanization and regional development, population mobility within the Amazon has hardly been studied at all, as well as the distinct migration patterns between men and women. This paper uses a longitudinal dataset of 250 farm households in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon to understand differentials between men and women migrants to urban and rural destinations and between men and women non-migrants. First, we use hazard analysis based on the Kaplan–Meier (KM) estimator to obtain the cumulative probability that an individual living in the study area in 1990 or at time t, will out-migrated at some time, t+n, before 1999. Results indicate that out-migration to other rural areas in the Amazon, especially pristine areas is considerably greater than out-migration to the growing, but still incipient, Amazonian urban areas. Furthermore, men are more likely to out-migrate to rural areas than women, while the reverse occurs for urban areas. Difference-of-means tests were employed to examine potential factors accounting for differentials between male and female out-migration to urban and rural areas. Among the key results, relative to men younger women are more likely to out-migrate to urban areas; more difficult access from farms to towns and roads constrains women's migration; and access to new lands in the Amazon–an important cause of further deforestation–is more associated with male out-migration. Economic factors such as engagement in on-farm work, increasing resource scarcity–measured by higher population density at the farm and reduction in farm land on forest and crops–and increase in pasture land are more associated with male out-migration to rural areas. On the other hand, increasing resource scarcity, higher population density and weaker migration networks are more associated with female out-migration to urban areas. Thus, a “vicious cycle” is created: Pressure over land leads to deforestation in most or all farm forest areas and reduces the possibilities for further agricultural extensification (deforestation); out-migration, especially male out-migration, occurs to other rural or forest areas in the Amazon (with women being more likely to choose urban destinations); and, giving continuing population growth and pressures in the new settled areas, new pressures promote further out-migration to rural destinations and unabated deforestation.}}

Three \{ANN\} packages were used: INForm, CAD/Chem and MATLAB. Twenty variants of gradient descent, conjugate gradient, quasi-Newton and Bayesian regularisation algorithms were used to train networks containing a single hidden layer of 3–12 nodes. All \{INForm\} and CAD/Chem models trained satisfactorily for tensile strength, disintegration time and percentage dissolution at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. Similarly, acceptable training was obtained for \{MATLAB\} models using Bayesian regularisation. Training of \{MATLAB\} models with other algorithms was erratic. This effect was attributed to a tendency for the \{MATLAB\} implementation of the algorithms to attenuate training in local minima of the error surface. Predictive models for tablet capping and friability could not be generated. The most predictive models from each \{ANN\} package varied with respect to the optimum network architecture and training algorithm. No significant differences were found in the predictive ability of these models. It is concluded that comparable models are obtainable from different \{ANN\} programs provided that both the network architecture and training algorithm are optimised. A broad strategy for optimisation of the predictive ability of an \{ANN\} model is proposed.}}

As more physicists move into developmental biology, we need to be aware of the “cultural” differences between the two fields, whose concepts of “explanations” and “models” traditionally differ: biologists aiming to identify genetic pathways and expression patterns, physicists tending to look for generic underlying principles. Here we discuss how we can combine such biological and physical approaches into a cell-centered approach to developmental biology. Genetic information can only indirectly influence the morphology and physiology of multicellular organisms. \{DNA\} translates into proteins and regulatory \{RNA\} sequences, which steer the biophysical properties of cells, their response to signals from neighboring cells, and the production and properties of extracellular matrix (ECM). We argue that in many aspects of biological development, cells’ inner workings are irrelevant: what matter are the cell's biophysical properties, the signals it emits and its responses to extracellular signals. Thus we can separate questions about genetic regulation from questions about development. First, we ask what effects a gene network has on cell phenomenology, and how it operates. We then ask through which mechanisms such single-cell phenomenology directs multicellular morphogenesis and physiology. This approach treats the cell as the fundamental module of development. We discuss how this cell-centered approach—which requires significant input from computational biophysics—can assist and supplement experimental research in developmental biology. We review cell-centered approaches, focusing in particular on the Cellular Potts Model (CPM), and present the Tissue Simulation Toolkit which implements the CPM.}}

These issues however have implications for distributive and procedural justice, particularly when considered within the efforts of the UNFCCC. The issues are examined through an evaluation of key criteria relating to climate change scenarios and vulnerability in the developing world, and second through two southern African case studies that explore the ways in which livelihoods are differentially impacted by (i) inequitable natural-resource use policies, (ii) community-based natural-resource management programmes. Finally, we consider the placement of climate change amongst the package of factors affecting equity in natural-resource use, and whether this placement creates a case for considering climate change as ‘special’ amongst livelihood disturbing factors in the developing world.}}

Nutrients are assumedly obtained via an interaction apparatus produced within the pathogen's hyphae, opposite to which the host cell is triggered to invaginate its plasmalemma. Rare attempts of ‘self-parasitism’ were also seen. Entering the conidial stage, stromata are laid down under the lower epidermis. The dying tissue above may explain the necrotic spots observed on infected leaflets. Foot cells in the conidial stromata produce thick-walled conidiophores, which grow sympodially. New conidiophores may grow into empty shells of old ones. Conidia are detached after pores between them and conidiophores have become plugged by organelles resembling Woronin bodies. Conidia are usually two-celled and their walls contain chitin and β-1,3-glucans as indicated by labelling with gold-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin and anti-β-1,3-glucan antibodies.

The parasite undergoes substantial stage-specific losses during its development in the mosquito, which in some cases lead to complete refractoriness of the mosquito against the parasite. The underlying genetics of refractoriness are complex and multifactorial. Completion of the genome sequence of An. gambiae 2 years ago, together with the development of \{DNA\} microarrays in this species and the extension of the \{RNAi\} technique to adult mosquitoes, has allowed comparative and functional genomic approaches of the mosquito innate immune system. A variety of factors were shown to negatively affect the development of Plasmodium parasites in the mosquito, in some cases leading to complete transmission blockage. In addition, mosquito factors have been identified that play positive roles and are required for successful transmission of the parasite. These findings indicate a highly complex interplay between parasite and vector. Research is continuing to identify new factors involved in this interaction and to decipher the interplay of these molecules and their regulation.}}

It is hoped that a comprehensive review of publications relevant to this subject will be helpful to both scientists and clinicians who are interested in the sciences of erectile function/dysfunction. Aims To review the roles of extracellular signaling molecules, their receptors, intracellular effectors, and phosphodiesterases in cyclic nucleotide signaling that leads to cavernous smooth muscle relaxation. The involvement of these molecules in the development of erectile dysfunction and the possibility of using them as therapeutic agents or targets are also discussed. Methods Entrez, the search engine for life sciences, was used to search for publications relevant to the topics of this review. Keywords used in the searches included vascular, cavernous, penis, smooth muscle, signaling molecules (adenosine, nitric oxide, etc.), and key elements in the cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways (cAMP, cGMP, cyclases, PKG, PKA, etc.). Articles that are dedicated to the study of erectile function/dysfunction were prioritized for citation. Results More than 1,000 articles were identified, many of which are studies of the vascular system and are therefore reviewed but not cited. Studies on erectile function have identified both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathways in cavernous smooth muscle. Many signaling molecules of these two pathways have been shown capable of inducing erection when administered intracavernously. However, for sexually induced erection, nitric oxide (NO) is the responsible signaling molecule and it passes on the signal through soluble guanyl cyclase (sGC), cGMP, and protein kinase G (PKG). Conclusions The NO/sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway is principally responsible for sexually stimulated erection. Detumescence is mainly carried out by the degradation of cGMP by phosphodiesterase 5. Both cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways are susceptible to genetic and biochemical alterations in association with erectile dysfunction. Several key elements along these pathways are potential therapeutic targets.}}

The results of detailed field mapping suggest that pseudotachylyte may serve as a dynamic indicator of rupture directivity and yield general estimates of some earthquake source parameters when examined at the multi-kilometer, fault-system scale. Pseudotachylyte fault veins are primarily exposed within eight NE-striking, sub-vertical fault zones that have a cumulative length of more than 21 km. The fault zones are mapped for 7.3 km along strike and fan to the northeast from a 170-m-wide outcrop belt to a maximum cross-strike width of 2.3 km. Pre-existing structural control on rupture geometry is indicated by concordance between foliation and fault veins, as well as spatial coincidence between the limbs of map-scale, rootless isoclinal folds and the location of most fault zones. The central portion of the longest fault zone exhibits evidence for dextral oblique slip that involved more than 2.1 m of strike-slip offset between four parallel fault veins that are interpreted to have formed in response to a single rupture event. In addition, an along-strike continuity and systematic distribution of fault zones, a progressive northeastward decrease in pseudotachylyte volume and maximum vein thickness, and a relative scarcity of cross-cutting relationships further suggests that the majority of the frictional melt in the system may have developed in response to one (or several) multi-kilometer ruptures, as opposed to hundreds of shorter ruptures. The similarity of kilometer-scale relationships observed along the Homestake pseudotachylyte system with the subsurface slip distribution and surface geometry of present-day, strike-slip earthquakes is interpreted to indicate that frictional melting occurred within a concentrated zone of moment release or an earthquake hypocenter during one or more Mw ≥ 6.3 earthquakes (M0 ≥ 6.9 × 1025 dyn cm) that involved northeastward rupture propagation.}}

This microseismicity releases only a small fraction of the slip occurring on the fault and the majority of the accumulating elastic strain is released either through aseismic creep or in rare large events. Distinguishing between creeping or non-creeping patches on faults and determining the resulting accumulated slip deficit is important in assessing the seismic hazard associated with a fault. Unfortunately, surface creep data alone are insufficient to constrain the creep at depth on the fault. Here we analyze the possibility of using microseismicity as a further constraint. An analysis of the accumulation of Coulomb stress associated with the fault creep indicates that the transition from creeping regions to locked patches has the potential to affect the local seismicity pattern. Precise relative relocations of the microseismicity of the Hayward fault [1] [F. Waldhauser, W.L. Ellsworth, Fault structure and mechanics of the Hayward Fault, California, from double-difference earthquake locations, J. Geophys. Res. 107(3), doi:10.1029/2000JB000084, 2002.] indicate that a fraction of the events repeat, indicating recurrent ruptures of the same small patch. A comparison of the creeping pattern resulting from a Finite Element deformation Model with this precisely relocated microseismicity indicates that the non-repeating earthquakes mainly occur in the transitional zones from creeping to locked patches, while recurrent (repeating) earthquakes cluster in high creep-rate regions. Building from this observation, we have developed an analysis approach to better define patterns of creep, and thus the slip deficit, on the Hayward fault. Additionally this creep rate and its spatial pattern on the fault vary as a function of time after the system is loaded by earthquakes on the locked patches.}}

Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are classified in various groups (P-I–IV), according to their domain composition. P-III SVMPs, comprising metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains, exert more potent hemorrhagic activity than P-I SVMPs, which present only the metalloproteinase domain. \{SVMPs\} degrade various components of the basement membrane and are also able to hydrolyze endothelial cell membrane proteins, such as integrins and cadherins, involved in cell–matrix and cell–cell adhesion. In addition, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains interact with endothelial cell integrins, interfering with their adhesion to extracellular matrix. Hemorrhage induced by \{SVMPs\} is an extremely rapid event in vivo, with capillary endothelial cells showing drastic structural alterations within few minutes. In contrast, observations in cell culture conditions do not evidence such rapid endothelial cell damage. Instead, the main effect is detachment and rounding of these cells; it is only after several hours of incubation that cells show evidence of apoptotic damage. This apparent discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro observations can be explained if biophysical forces operating on microvessels in vivo are taken into consideration. It is proposed that SVMP-induced hemorrhage occurs in vivo by a ‘two-step’ mechanism. Initially, \{SVMPs\} degrade basement membrane and adhesion proteins, thus weakening the capillary wall and perturbing the interactions between endothelial cells and the basement membrane. Then, transmural pressure acting on the weakened capillary wall causes distention. As a consequence, endothelial cells become very thin, until the integrity of the capillary wall is lost at some points, where extravasation occurs. In addition, endothelial cells become more susceptible to blood flow-dependent shear stress, which further contributes to capillary wall disruption.}}

Therefore, in this study, we explored the effect of \{HAs\} on human cancer cells. The result showed that \{HAs\} could cause cancer cell apoptosis, especially in HL-60 cells. Using flow cytometry, we found that \{HAs\} treatment (0–4 mg/ml) markedly induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The result also revealed increased phosphorylation in p38 and c-Jun, cytochrome c release, and expression of tBid, Fas, and FasL in the HAs-treated HL-60 cells.

The data showed that only \{SB203580\} had strong potential in inhibiting HL-60 cell apoptosis and related protein expression and phosphorylation. Therefore, we suggested that \{HAs\} mediated HL-60 apoptosis via the p38-FasL and Bid pathway. According to these results, \{HAs\} could be developed as chemopreventive agents.

abstract = {In the present paper we propose a novel method for the identification and modeling of neural networks using extracellular spike recordings. We create a deterministic model of the effective network, whose dynamic behavior fits experimental data. The network obtained by our method includes explicit mathematical models of each of the spiking neurons and a description of the effective connectivity between them. Such a model allows us to study the properties of the neuron ensemble independently from the original data. It also permits to infer properties of the ensemble that cannot be directly obtained from the observed spike trains. The performance of the method is tested with spike trains artificially generated by a number of different neural networks.}}

Rats anesthetized with pentobarbital were treated with lipolysaccharide (LPS) 20 mg/kg / 20 min i.v. and mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), rectal temperature and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were recorded. \{LPS\} induced a fall in blood pressure, an increase in \{HR\} (+ 20%) and \{RSNA\} (+ 355%); the arterial \{PO2\} and \{PCO2\} remained stable and the injection was fatal within 4 h. Baroreceptor and chemoreceptor denervation accelerated the fall in \{MBP\} but did not change the survival time. Under those conditions; \{RSNA\} excitation was slightly more pronounced. During treatment with gallamine and under artificial respiration to avoid possible respiratory changes through the chemoreflex pathway, the effects of \{LPS\} remained, except for a decrease in arterial PO2. Electrolytic lesioning of the nucleus tractus solitarius or blocking the effects of baroreflex efferents by either an α1 or α2-adrenoceptor antagonists failed to alter the effects of LPS. After treatment with a β-adrenoceptor antagonist, \{LPS\} increased \{RSNA\} but not \{HR\} and the survival time of the rats shortened. \{LPS\} administered i.c. (1 mg/kg) induced, with a short latency, effects comparable to those produced by i.v. injection. Surprisingly, the time correlation between \{RSNA\} and \{HR\} rhythms persisted when \{MBP\} dropped after \{LPS\} and moreover it reappeared in baroreceptor denervated rats after LPS. Thus under these conditions of altered baroreflex pathway and \{LPS\} induced sympathetic activation, the sympathetic output from the medulla appears to play a role in the correlation between heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity. These data indicate that the marked \{RSNA\} activation and the tachycardia are correlated and that the baroreflex and chemoreflex are not inhibited during sepsis but appear to be of minor importance in the sympathetic activation and in the blood pressure modifications.}}

It was shown recently that the constitutive vertebrate M-band component myomesin can form antiparallel dimers, which might cross-link the neighboring thick filaments. Myomesin consists mainly of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) and fibronectin type \{III\} (Fn) domains, while several muscle types express the EH-myomesin splice isoform, generated by the inclusion of the unique EH-segment of about 100 amino acid residues (aa) in the center of the molecule. Here we use atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy for the biophysical characterization of myomesin. The \{AFM\} identifies the “mechanical fingerprints” of the modules constituting the myomesin molecule. Stretching of homomeric polyproteins, constructed of Ig and Fn domains of human myomesin, produces a typical saw-tooth pattern in the force-extension curve. The domains readily refold after relaxation. In contrast, stretching of a heterogeneous polyprotein, containing several repeats of the My6-EH fragment reveals a long initial plateau corresponding to the sum of EH-segment contour lengths, followed by several My6 unfolding peaks. According to this, the EH-segment is characterized as an entropic chain with a persistence length of about 0.3 nm. In \{TEM\} pictures, the EH-domain appears as a gap in the molecule, indicating a random coil conformation similar to the \{PEVK\} region of titin. \{CD\} spectroscopy measurements support this result, demonstrating a mostly non-folded conformation for the EH-segment. We suggest that similarly to titin, myomesin is a molecular spring, whose elasticity is modulated by alternative splicing. The Ig and Fn domains might function as reversible “shock absorbers” by sequential unfolding in the case of extremely high or long sustained stretching forces. These complex visco-elastic properties of myomesin might be crucial for the stability of the sarcomere.}}

Gfi1−/− mice showed a global reduction of myeloid and lymphoid \{DCs\} in all lymphoid organs whereas epidermal Langerhans cells were enhanced in number. In vivo, Gfi1−/− \{DCs\} showed striking phenotypic and functional alterations such as defective maturation and increased cytokine production. In vitro, Gfi1−/− hematopoietic progenitor cells were unable to develop into DCs. Instead, they differentiated into macrophages, suggesting that Gfi1 is a critical modulator of \{DC\} versus macrophage development. Analysis of hematopoietic chimeras and retrovirus-reconstituted hematopoietic progenitor cells established a cell autonomous and nonredundant role for Gfi1 in \{DC\} development. The developmental defect of Gfi1−/− progenitor cells was associated with decreased \{STAT3\} activation. In conclusion, we have identified Gfi1 as a critical transcription factor that controls \{DC\} versus macrophage development and dissociates \{DC\} maturation and activation.}}

Although significant advances have occurred, these applications cannot reach full potential without the availability of materials with tunable degradation behavior. Here, we present novel thiol–acrylate degradable networks, which provide a simple method for forming degradable networks having specific degradation profiles. Degradable thiol–acrylate networks are formed from copolymerizing a thiol monomer with PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA based diacrylate macromers. A theoretical model has been developed to describe the kinetic chain length distribution, the bulk degradation behavior, and the reverse gelation point of these thiol–acrylate hydrogels. Varying the thiol functionality, as well as the relative stoichiometries of the thiol and acrylate functional groups, provides a facile means to control the kinetic chain length distribution and the concomitant degradation behavior of these systems. The extent of percentage mass loss of the network at the reverse gelation point is controlled from as low as 30% to as high as 95%, thereby giving the unique ability to dictate the material properties of the hydrogel before the network becomes completely soluble.}}

abstract = {The description of ecosystems’ evolution is a challenge for many scientists. Several attempts have been made, mostly using compartments and flows, to describe the structure of ecosystems and holistic indicators or goal functions (GF) to describe the state and the trend of their evolution. Under a steady flow of energy from the environment, an ecosystem can increase the biomass by enlarging the number of individuals and/or their body weights until a certain steady state level. In this situation neither the structure (e.g. species composition) nor the pattern of flows linking its compartments vary and both biomass and flow reach an “optimal” level. Benefits compensate the costs of the ecosystem evolution. A question is open: when can an ecosystem be considered to be in an optimal state and how does it reach this state? The answer to this question is also useful to solve the problems related to the concept of reference state as posed in the Water Framework Directive (WFD, EU, 2000/60/EC). In order to answer this question the characteristics of a suitable indicator are discussed and two state indicators are proposed, based on the assumption that costs and benefits of the ecosystem growth have to be in balance. The first one, the benefit/cost indicator (BC), is a function of well known state indicators, that fully satisfies the properties required although is difficult to compute and complex to understand. Nevertheless, from the researcher point of view, this indicator gives interesting insights into system behavior. The second, the supply demand balance (SDB), is an indicator based on two main assumptions, the first one being that an ecosystem can be represented by a network of compartments and flows, the second that the metabolic rates scale across species approximately as the (3/4) power of mass. The \{SDB\} indicator summarizes the distance of an ecosystem from an optimal state in a single number. Under these assumptions the \{SDB\} indicator can be regarded as a measure of ecosystem state. It is easy to compute and simple to understand. \{SDB\} looks like a good indicator both for scientific and practical uses to understand where the ecosystem is going. Finally the applicability of \{SDB\} is investigated by computing its values for 33 trophic networks describing the food webs of different aquatic ecosystems.}}

While the nucleolus is known to function in vital cellular events, little is known about how its components are correctly assembled. Through the analysis of a Drosophila mutant that exhibits a reduced number of mushroom body (MB) neurons in the brain, we reveal that the slender lobes (sle) gene encodes a novel nuclear protein that affects nucleolar organization during development. In sle mutant neuroblasts, the nucleolus was packed more tightly, forming a dense sphere, and the nucleolar proteins fibrillarin and Nop60B were abnormally distributed in the interphase nucleolus. Moreover, another nucleolar marker, Aj1 antigen, was localized to the center of the nucleolus in a manner complementary to the Nop60B distribution, and also formed a large aggregate in the cytoplasm. While developmental defects were limited to a few tissues in sle mutants, including \{MBs\} and nurse cells, the altered organization of the nucleolar components were evident in most developing tissues. Therefore, we conclude that Sle is a general factor of nuclear architecture in Drosophila that is required for the correct organization of the nucleolus during development.}}

Previously, we have shown that malondialdehyde, an inflammation product of lipid peroxidation, and acetaldehyde, a component of both ethanol metabolism and cigarette smoke, form protein adducts that stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) activation in bronchial epithelial cells. We have also shown that \{PKC\} can regulate bronchial epithelial cell wound repair. We hypothesize that bovine serum albumin adducted with malondialdehyde and acetaldehyde (BSA–MAA) decreases bronchial epithelial cell wound repair via binding to scavenger receptors on bronchial epithelial cells. To test this, confluent monolayers of bovine bronchial epithelial cells were grown in serum-free media prior to wounding the cells. Bronchial epithelial cell wound closure was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (up to 60%) in the presence of BSA-MAA than in media treated cells (Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis [LHC]-9-Roswell Park Memorial Institute [RPMI]). The specific scavenger receptor ligand, fucoidan, also stimulated \{PKC\} activation and decreased wound repair. Pretreatment with fucoidan blocked malondialdehyde–acetaldehyde binding to bronchial epithelial cells. When bronchial epithelial cells were preincubated with a \{PKC\} alpha inhibitor, Gö 6976, the inhibition of wound closure by fucoidan and BSA–MAA was blocked. Western blot demonstrated the presence of several scavenger receptors on bronchial epithelial cell membranes, including SRA, SRBI, SRBII, and CD36. Scavenger receptor–mediated activation of \{PKC\} alpha may function to reduce wound healing under conditions of alcohol and cigarette smoke exposure where malondialdehyde–acetaldehyde adducts may be present.}}

The basic construction considers genes as templates for protein production, where regulation processes result from activators or repressors connecting to \{DNA\} binding sites. All the parameters in the models have a straightforward biological meaning. After describing the general properties of the basic mechanisms of positive and negative gene regulation, we apply this framework to the self-regulation of the trp operon and to the genetic switch involved in the regulation of the lac operon. One of the consequences of this approach is the existence of conserved quantities depending on the initial conditions that tune bifurcations of fixed points.

abstract = {Mutations in \{FGFR1\} and \{TWIST1\} have been reported to affect the timing of calvarial suture fusion resulting in craniosynostosis and facial abnormalities. We screened nonpathologic populations for genetic polymorphisms that may associate with normal craniofacial variation. We identified 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FGFR1, 6 of which were novel (g.8591855G→A, g.8593685G→A, g.8602303C→T, g.8602475A→G (p.Ile293Val), g.8605849C→T, g.8607868G→A). No \{SNPs\} were found in TWIST1. \{FGFR1\} \{SNP\} haplotypes were reconstructed for Caucasian, Asian, Australian Aboriginal, and African American populations. All populations shared two linkage disequilibrium blocks, with one haplotype-tag \{SNP\} (htSNP) tagging each block. The htSNP g.8592931G→C was found to have a significant negative correlation with the cephalic index for all populations (R = −0.187, p = 0.036), with larger correlations in Asians and females. This finding is a starting point in the identification of a set of \{SNPs\} that can be genotyped to determine both normal and disease craniofacial phenotypes.}}

abstract = {In this paper we approach the optimization of fluid tree networks by relaxing the usual one-flow regime assumption. The pumping power requirement is minimized, under global volume constraint. Two types of constructal network geometries are investigated: (i) the fluid users are distributed uniformly on a surface and, (ii) the fluid users are located on the periphery of a disc-shaped area. In both cases, the flow regime in a given pipe of the network emerges as a result of pumping power minimization. It is shown that the individual users’ consumption and number of users dictate the transition from one optimal flow regime configuration to another. Under certain circumstances, laminar and turbulent flow regimes are present simultaneously in different pipes of an optimized network. The occurrence of turbulence at a certain level of pipes in the optimal hierarchical networks always leads to turbulence in the higher levels of pipes. The paper provides designers with basic tools for the conceptual design of fluid networks.}}

The catalytic performance of MoVTeNbO multifunctional catalysts is related to the presence of Te2 M 20 O57-type phase ( M = Mo , V, and Nb), although cooperation between phases must also exist. However, a certain composition or composition range is necessary to achieve the best catalytic performance, since the chemical composition of Te2 M 20 O57-type phase changes in every catalyst. Te2 M 20 O57-type phase with a Te0.32(Mo0.79Nb0.11V0.10)5O14 composition has been found in the most active and selective catalyst whereas Te0.6(Mo0.72Nb0.14V0.13)5O14 is the constituent in the less active and selective one, the rest of the catalysts presenting intermediate both Te/Mo ratio and catalytic performance.}}

abstract = {The constraint-based analysis has emerged as a useful tool for analysis of biochemical networks. This work introduces the concept of kinetic constraints. It is shown that maximal reaction rates are appropriate constraints only for isolated enzymatic reactions. For biochemical networks, it is revealed that constraints for formation of a steady state require specific relationships between maximal reaction rates of all enzymes. The constraints for a branched network are significantly different from those for a cyclic network. Moreover, the constraints do not require Michaelis-Menten constants for most enzymes, and they only require the constants for the enzymes at the branching or cyclic point. Reversibility of reactions at system boundary or branching point may significantly impact on kinetic constraints. When enzymes are regulated, regulations may impose severe kinetic constraints for the formation of steady states. As the complexity of a network increases, kinetic constraints become more severe. In addition, it is demonstrated that kinetic constraints for networks with co-regulation can be analyzed using the approach. In general, co-regulation enhances the constraints and therefore larger fluctuations in fluxes can be accommodated in the networks with co-regulation. As a first example of the application, we derive the kinetic constraints for an actual network that describes sucrose accumulation in the sugar cane culm, and confirm their validity using numerical simulations.}}

While it appears that these models successfully model transition states and intermediates between the unfolded and native ensembles, it is unclear how accurately they capture smaller, yet biologically relevant, structural changes within the native ensemble after energetic perturbation. Here, we address the following questions. Can a simple Gō-model of interleukin-1β, based on native topology, describe changes in structural properties of the native ensemble as the protein stability is changed? Or is it necessary to include a more explicit representation of atoms, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces to describe these changes? The native ensemble of IL-1β was characterized using a variety of experimental probes under native (0 M NaCl, guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl)), moderately destabilized (0 M NaCl, 0.8 M Gdn-HCl), and in moderate salt concentration (0.8 M NaCl, 0 M Gdn-HCl). Heteronuclear 1H–15N nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) \{NMR\} spectra confirmed that the β-trefoil global fold was largely intact under these three conditions. However, 25 of the 153 residues throughout the chain did demonstrate 13C and 1H–15N chemical shifts when perturbed with 0.8 M NaCl or Gdn-HCl. Despite large differences in protection factors from solvent hydrogen-deuterium exchange for all residues between stable (0 M Gdn-HCl) and destabilized (0.8 M Gdn-HCl) IL-1β, no difference in steady-state 15N–1H \{NOE\} enhancements were measured. Thus, the chemical shifts correlate with a global but limited increase in residue flexibility in the presence of Gdn-HCl. Minimalist simulations highlight the regions of greatest position shift between native and 0.8 M Gdn-HCl, which were determined experimentally. This correlation demonstrates that structural changes within the native ensemble of IL-1β are, at least partially, governed by the principle of minimal energetic frustration.}}

The catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of a \{KL\} zeolite, previously alkalized with BaO, using an aqueous solution of tetraammineplatinum(II) hydroxide as platinum precursor. The solid was successively calcined in an oxygen stream and reduced in flowing hydrogen, at 773 K. Reaction is highly selective towards toluene (&gt;60%) at conversion levels even close to 100%, with benzene, heptenes, methylcyclohexane and ethylcyclopentane as major byproducts. From the product distribution and the dehydrocyclization results of the reaction products performed in separate experiments, a macroscopic mechanism is proposed. Essentially, n-heptane is adsorbed and transformed on the catalyst surface through an alkene-like intermediate (σC7), following five possible parallel interconnected paths, involving hydrogenolysis, isomerization, dehydrogenation and cyclization reactions. Formation of toluene as a primary product is explained by a “rake scheme” in which the σC7 intermediate is successively transformed, following two possible routes: (a) C1–C6 ring closure and subsequent further dehydrogenation; (b) successive dehydrogenation to heptatriene and then cyclization to toluene. These transformations occur in the adsorbed phase and on the same active site, in such a way that only a small fraction of the total adsorbed intermediates formed appear in the gas phase. The rest are not desorbed due to their high reactivity.}}

Radar images are particularly efficient in the Venezuelan Andes where dense vegetation and frequent cloud covering earlier lent difficulties to remote sensing studies. We focused our analysis in the Valera–Rio Momboy and Bocono faults corner and in the Mucujun area. We show that, in an area where ongoing compression and strike–slip deformations occur, brittle extension can be detected independently from previous knowledge. Extensional structures correspond to elongated tilted blocks with dimension less than 10 km in width. Blocks are bounded by curved faults in plan view, the concavity being turned towards the axial part of the belt. The geometry and kinematics of such structures suggest that syn-orogenic extension started together with initiation of right-lateral strike–slip motion along the Bocono Fault in the Plio-Quaternary.}}

The heterotrimeric G proteins consist of α-, β-, and γ-subunits and act as molecular switches to relay information from transmembrane receptors to intracellular effectors. The switch mechanism is a function of the inherent \{GTPase\} activity of the α-subunit. The α-subunit is comprised of two domains, the \{GTPase\} domain and the Helical domain. The \{GTPase\} domain performs all of the known α-subunit functions while little is know about the role of the Helical domain. To gain a better understanding of α-subunit function, we performed a screen for loss-of-function mutations, using the Gα2-subunit of Dictyostelium. Gα2 is essential for the developmental life cycle of Dictyostelium. It is known that the loss of Gα2 function results in a failure of cells to enter the developmental phase, producing a visibly abnormal phenotype. This allows the easy identification of amino acids essential to Gα2 function. A library of random point mutations in the gα2 cDNA was constructed using low fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The library was then expressed in a gα2 null cell line and screened for loss-of-function mutations. Mutations were identified in isolated clones by sequencing the gα2 insert. To date, sixteen single amino acids changes have been identified in Gα2 which result in loss-of-function. Of particular interest are seven mutations found in the Helical domain of the α-subunit. These loss-of-function mutations in the α-subunit Helical domain may provide important insight into its function.}}

However, these findings were based on acute administrations of 5-HT4 receptor agonists and antagonists, which were active only in a subpopulation of 5-HT neurons. We had no evidence that this influence was significant when considering the entire DRN, nor if it was persistent after chronic treatments. In addition, the poor distribution of 5-HT4 receptors within the \{DRN\} raised the question of the neuroanatomical bases underlying this control. Methods and results Here we show that the subacute intraperitoneal (IP) injection of the 5-HT4 receptor agonists prucalopride (2.5 mg/kg) and \{RS\} 67333 (1.5 mg/kg) 30 minutes before the beginning of recordings augment the mean firing rate of \{DRN\} neurons by 40% and 66%, respectively. These increases remain stable when the compounds are administered continuously during 3 and 21 days; the effects of the 3-day treatment are blocked by the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist \{GR\} 125487 (1000 μg/kg, intravenous [i.v.]). In addition, stereotaxic microinjections of herpes simplex viruses, transformed to overexpress 5-HT4 receptors, increase \{DRN\} 5-HT neuronal mean activity when performed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) but not in the striatum or in the hippocampus. Conclusions This finding suggests the existence of a 5-HT4-dependent activation of \{DRN\} that may involve the mPFC, unveiling the 5-HT4 receptor as a putative player in the physiopathology of several disorders related to central 5-HT dysfunction}}

This paper demonstrates that these reforms did much to worsen pre-existing weaknesses of the sector. The paper criticises the content of the reform agenda and the manner in which it was produced, arguing that these were reforms in which considerations of public health were less significant than conformity to the wider model of neo-liberal social and economic development prevailing at the time. It also highlights problems of implementing the reform agenda, which reduced the coherency of the reforms. The paper goes on to examine the impact of the crisis, noting links with the preceding reforms. It identifies a number of insights and lessons of potential value to other countries which are pursuing similar policies.}}

The study involved a series of 26 single-gender focus groups with 157 English-speaking students aged 11–19 years from the \{UK\} and the US. Many students reported that the internet was their primary general information source. Information sources were defined during analysis in terms of previous experience of the source, saliency of the available information, and credibility of the source (defined in terms of expertise, trustworthiness and empathy). Most focus group participants had extensive personal experience with the internet and some information providers therein (notably search engines). Internet health information was regarded generally as salient. Its saliency was increased through active searching and personalisation. Perceived credibility of the internet varied because expertise and trustworthiness were sometimes difficult to determine, and empathy could be facilitated through online communities but the individual could control disclosure. The internet combines positive features of traditional lay and professional, personal and impersonal sources. Although it is unlikely to supplant the role of trusted peers and adults, the internet has found an important place among adolescents’ repertory of health information sources.}}

abstract = {In heavily congested networks, \{RED\} using parameters that provide the best link utilization produces poor response times. In this work, we devise and study the performance of a simple active queue management mechanism called Subsidized \{RED\} (SubRED) targeted at short-lived flows or fragile flows (e.g. most \{HTTP\} flows) to keep link utilization high while reducing the average flow response time. Our simulation studies have compared the performance of \{RED\} and SubRED for a network with \{HTTP\} traffic at offered loads less, close to, and more than the link capacity. Simulations show that a subsidy given to a flow provides significantly better performance in terms of \{HTTP\} request-reply delays without sacrificing the link utilization. The new scheme is very simple to implement. Combined with our cost-effective flow table based implementation, SubRED does not impose an excessive resource overhead.}}

The term ‘systems’ in systems biology comes from systems theory or dynamic systems theory: systems biology is defined through the application of systems- and signal-oriented approaches for an understanding of inter- and intra-cellular dynamic processes. The aim of the present text is to review the systems and control perspective of dynamic systems. The biologist’s conceptual framework for representing the variables of a biochemical reaction network, and for describing their relationships, are pathway maps. A principal goal of systems biology is to turn these static maps into dynamic models, which can provide insight into the temporal evolution of biochemical reaction networks. Towards this end, we review the case for differential equation models as a ‘natural’ representation of causal entailment in pathways. Block-diagrams, commonly used in the engineering sciences, are introduced and compared to pathway maps. The stimulus–response representation of a molecular system is a necessary condition for an understanding of dynamic interactions among the components that make up a pathway. Using simple examples, we show how biochemical reactions are modelled in the dynamic systems framework and visualized using block-diagrams.}}

The models are validated by their ability to reproduce observed trends of interannual variations of nutrients delivered by the Seine during the last 50 years, as well as the response of the marine system in terms of diatoms and dinoflagellate development, for which data are available from 1976 to 1984 for the former and from 1987 to 1997 for the latter. The results show clearly that dry years, where silica inputs show a deficit with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus, are those where summer blooms of dinoflagellates are particularly pronounced. Various scenarios of human activity in the watershed are simulated by the two models, including a reconstitution of the ‘pristine’ state, a historical state corresponding to the situation at the end of the 18th century, as well as several scenarios corresponding to the present situation with alternative policies of wastewater nitrogen and/or phosphorus treatment.}}

We implement the neuron circuit with a 0.5 μ m \{CMOS\} semiconductor process by means of analog circuitry. Moreover, we make most of the model parameters externally controllable so that we can control the behavior of the neuron. As a consequence, by properly setting its circuit parameters, the neuron can function as either a coincidence detector or an integrator. We show the measurement results from the prototype chip. In particular, we show coincidence detection of the input spikes in a short time-window. In addition, we illustrate complex responses of the neuron circuit, providing bifurcation diagrams of the internal state value and the interspike intervals of the output spikes. The proposed neuron circuit is useful for exploring a possible spatio-temporal coding paradigm by constructing a neural network based on the coincidence detection and the spatio-temporal chaotic dynamics.}}

This view leads to robust control analysis and synthesis problems with a deterministic nominal system and a stochastic, structured, model uncertainty. As a special case, we consider the stabilization over Erasure or drop-out channels. We show that the largest probability of erasure tolerable by the closed loop is obtained from solving a robust control synthesis problem. In more general terms, we establish that the set of plants which can be stabilized by linear controllers over fading channels is fundamentally limited by the channel generated uncertainty. We show that, the notion of mean square capacity, defined for a single channel in the loop, captures this limitation precisely and characterizes equivalence classes of channels within the class of memoryless fading channels.}}

In the present paper, we show (1) that both compounds potentiate the SNP-induced increase in cGMP in human platelets concentration-dependently. (2) However, whereas Sildenafil plus \{SNP\} treatment only partially inhibits thrombin-induced release of serotonin, the less selective Zaprinast plus \{SNP\} cause a complete inhibition. (3) The inhibition mediated by Sildenafil plus \{SNP\} is limited to low compound concentrations at which cAMP levels are increased, probably due to cGMP-mediated inhibition of PDE3. (4) High concentrations of Sildenafil (plus SNP) neither affect cAMP levels, likely due to the activation of PDE2, nor inhibits the release of serotonin. Thus, increases in both cyclic nucleotides seem to control platelet function. (5) Accordingly, treatment with increasing concentrations of Sildenafil plus \{SNP\} and a selective \{PDE2\} inhibitor, which by its own has no effect, induced a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP and complete inhibition of platelet activation. In summary, our data indicate that Sildenafil inhibits secretory function of human platelets at least in part due to the cGMP-mediated effects on intracellular cAMP and that entire inhibition of serotonin release from thrombin-activated platelets is controlled by both cyclic nucleotides.}}

Using \{CRC\} modelling techniques, we estimated a minimum lower bound for the total number of holdings infected as 642. A biologically plausible positive dependence between the statutory reporting and the fallen stock survey was found statistically significant. The sensitivity of the three sources combined was very low. The integration of the three overlapping sources provided a better understanding of the interactions within the surveillance network. However, the scarcity of the data and reduced overlapping among sources only allowed for very cautious inferences to be drawn about the true proportion of scrapie affected holdings in the national population. Future surveys and surveillance activities should be planned such that the resulting data can be used more effectively as part of \{CRC\} modelling approaches.}}

The \{ECM\} can respond to environmental stimuli and tissue injury by altering its abundance, composition, and spatial organization, with profound consequences on the structure and function of the tissues that it inhabits. \{ECM\} remodeling is now recognized as a central process underlying the maladaptive reorganization of cardiac size, shape, and function during the progression of CHF. \{ECM\} remodeling is largely determined by the balance of degradative enzymes, the MMPs, with respect to a highly regulated and complex assortment of multifunctional endogenous inhibitors, the TIMPs. Clinical studies over the past decade document increased \{MMP\} activities associated with diseased hearts. Animal models of cardiovascular disease, as well as transgenic mouse models, further support a role for \{MMPs\} in cardiac remodeling. Similarly, clinical, experimental, and genetic approaches implicate the involvement of \{TIMPs\} in heart disease, and \{TIMP\} expression is selectively reduced in the failing heart. The four known \{TIMP\} species are differentially regulated in the heart, and their specific role during the progression of \{CHF\} is not clear. Unique among TIMPs, TIMP-3 is \{ECM\} bound, highly expressed in the heart, uniformly reduced in failing hearts, and a potent endogenous inhibitor of \{MMPs\} and A Disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAMs) implicated in cardiac disease. The control of \{ECM\} remodeling in the failing heart may provide a missing link in our currently inadequate armamentarium of treatments for patients with CHF, and a better understanding of the complex role of \{TIMP\} proteins in the normal and failing myocardium, particularly the unique role of TIMP-3, may facilitate the development of targeted anti-remodeling strategies.}}

In addition to fibrillar collagens, collagenases can cleave several other matrix and non-matrix proteins including growth factors, and this way regulate cell growth and survival. Collagenases are important proteolytic tools for extracellular matrix remodeling during organ development and tissue regeneration, but they also apparently play important roles in many pathological situations and tumor progression and metastasis. Because of their potentially destructive characteristics the expression and activity of collagenases are strictly controlled. Synthesis of collagenases is regulated by extracellular signals via cellular signal transduction pathways at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Collagenases are synthesized as inactive pro-forms, and once activated, their activity is inhibited by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs, as well as by non-specific proteinase inhibitors. In this review we discuss the current view on the role of collagenases in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, as a basis for their feasibility in diagnosis and prognostication, as well as therapeutic targets in cancer patients.}}

Results Results revealed significant changes in the \{CAEP\} as a function of age and stimulation rate. At younger ages the N1–P2 component was elicited only at the slowest stimulation rates, and was more clearly apparent at successively faster stimulation rates as age increased. Conclusions We have described a stimulus paradigm that allows examination of the development of refractoriness by highlighting the interaction between age and rate on \{CAEP\} morphology.

Here, we provide evidence that a recombinant form of the α2(IV)NC1 domain of type-IV collagen could bind integrins α1β1 and αvβ3 expressed on melanoma cells and inhibit tumor cell adhesion in a ligand-specific manner. Systemic administration of recombinant α2(IV)NC1 domain potently inhibited \{M21\} melanoma tumor growth within full thickness human skin and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice. Interestingly, α2(IV)NC1 domain enhanced cellular senescence in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that recombinant α2(IV)NC1 domain is not only a potent anti-angiogenic reagent, but it also directly impacts tumor cell behavior.

The multi-component system includes a methyltransferase, which recognizes and methylates a specific \{DNA\} sequence, and an endonuclease which recognises the same sequence and cleaves within or close to this site. The endonuclease will only cleave \{DNA\} that is unmethylated at the specific site, thus host \{DNA\} is protected while non-host \{DNA\} is cleaved. However, following \{DNA\} replication, expression of the endonuclease must be delayed until the host \{DNA\} is appropriately methylated. In many R–M systems, this regulation is achieved at the transcriptional level via the controller protein, or C-protein. We have solved the first X-ray structure of an R–M controller protein, C.AhdI, to 1.69 Å resolution using selenomethionine MAD. C.AhdI is part of a Type \{IIH\} R–M system from the pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila. The structure reveals an all-α protein that contains a classical helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain and can be assigned to the Xre family of transcriptional regulators. Unlike its monomeric structural homologues, an extended helix generates an interface that results in dimerisation of the free protein. The dimer is electrostatically polarised and a positively charged surface corresponds to the position of the \{DNA\} recognition helices of the \{HTH\} domain. Comparison with the structure of the λ cI ternary complex suggests that C.AhdI activates transcription through direct contact with the σ70 subunit of \{RNA\} polymerase.}}

If this balance is shifted, body condition can decrease, challenging thermal homeostasis and further affecting energy balance. Prior studies of temperature regulation in sea lions have neither quantified basic all-inclusive heat flux values for animals swimming in cold water, nor determined whether they exhibit consistent spatial patterns of heat flux. Heat flux and skin temperature data were thus collected from four captive Steller sea lions using heat flux sensors (HFSs) with embedded thermistors. Optimal sensor placement was established using infrared thermography to locate the major areas of heat flux along the surface of the animals. Experiments were conducted on swimming animals in a large habitat tank with and without a drag harness, and on stationary animals in a temperature- and current-controlled swim flume. All heat flux measurements were corrected by a previously determined correction factor of 3.42 to account for insulative effects of the \{HFSs\} and attachment mechanism. Heat flux from shoulders and hips was consistently greater than from mid-trunk and axillary areas in both swimming and stationary animals, suggesting that certain areas of the body are preferentially used to offload excess heat. Mean heat flux for animals swimming with a drag harness was significantly greater than for unencumbered animals, indicating a likely increase in heat production beyond minimum heat loss. Thus, thermal stress does not appear to constitute significant costs for Steller sea lions swimming under conditions of increased drag at speeds of approximately 1 m/s in water temperatures of approximately 8.0 °C.}}

abstract = {Previous studies on the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) identified a conserved interaction pair comprised of Tyr204 from the P+1 loop and Glu230 at the end of the αF-helix. Single-point mutations of Tyr204 to Ala (Y204A) and Glu230 to Gln (E230Q) both resulted in alterations in enzymatic kinetics. To understand further the molecular basis for the altered kinetics and the structural role of each residue, we analyzed the \{Y204A\} and the \{E230Q\} mutants using hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange coupled with mass spectrometry and other biophysical techniques. The fact that the mutants exhibit distinct molecular properties, supports previous hypotheses that these two residues, although in the same interaction node, contribute to the same enzymatic functions through different molecular pathways. The Tyr204 mutation appears to affect the dynamic properties, while the Glu230 mutation affects the surface electrostatic profile of the enzyme. Furthermore, H/D exchange analysis defines the dynamic allosteric range of Tyr204 to include the catalytic loop and three additional distant surface regions, which exhibit increased deuterium exchange in the \{Y204A\} but not the \{E230Q\} mutant. Interestingly, these are the exact regions that previously showed decreased deuterium exchange upon binding of the RIα regulatory subunit of PKA. We propose that these sites, coupled with the P+1 loop through Tyr204, represent one of the major allosteric networks in the kinase. This coupling provides a coordinated response for substrate binding and enzyme catalysis. H/D exchange analysis also further defines the stable core of the catalytic subunit to include the αE, αF and αH-helix. All these observations lead to an interesting new way to view the structural architecture and allosteric conformational regulation of the protein kinase molecule.}}

Even though simulation is expedient towards evaluating and analyzing the performance of the emerging \{ASON\} protocols and algorithms, existing network simulators fail to support these operations. This paper presents work towards extending the ns-2 simulator with an additional simulation environment, namely asons, enabling experiments on \{ASON\} networks. The simulation environment was implemented as a set of distributed modules based on the G.8080 ITU-T recommendation. Special mechanisms focusing on \{ASON\} resilience features were realized and used to conduct a number of simulation experiments. Although the simulator is oriented to configuration and resilience experiments, it provides a sound basis for a rich set of other \{ASON\} experiments, with minimal additional customization effort. Following the presentation of the design and implementation aspects of the simulator, we describe sample resilience experiments supported by asons.}}

Here, we analyze, in primary human monocytes, the mechanisms involved in Tat-stimulated calcium mobilization and its relationship with TNF-α production. We show that the Tat protein induces a calcium signal by mobilizing calcium from extracellular stores. This calcium signal is totally blocked when cells are stimulated in the presence of \{DHP\} receptor inhibitors such as nimodipine or calcicludine, thus suggesting the implication of this L-type calcium channel. By using RT-PCR amplification, Western blot with antibodies directed against the α1D subunit, binding assays with specific agonists or antagonists, and inhibition with specific antisense oligonucleotides, we show that \{DHP\} receptors are expressed and functional in primary human monocytes. Interestingly, we demonstrate that Tat-induced calcium mobilization is tightly linked to TNF-α production, thus indicating that Tat-induced mobilization and TNF-α production are entirely mediated by \{DHP\} receptors, as shown by their total inhibition by nimodipine, calcicludine, or anti-α1D antisense oligonucleotides.}}

To facilitate the understanding of receptor structure and function at the molecular level, a molecular model was built for the nearly full-length ErbB2 dimer. Modeling was based on the x-ray or nuclear-magnetic resonance structures of extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains. The extracellular domain was positioned above the cell membrane based on the distance determined from experimentally measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Favorable dimerization interactions are predicted for the extracellular, transmembrane, and protein kinase domains in the model of a nearly full-length dimer of ErbB2, which may act in a coordinated fashion in ErbB2 homodimerization, and also in heterodimers of ErbB2 with other members of the ErbB family.}}

Based upon kinetic measurements performed in a gradient free loop reactor and \{DRIFTS\} examinations, a mean field model is established to simulate catalytic data and calculate surface coverages. The kinetic model includes a network of 16 elementary reactions whereby \{NO\} oxidation is described by an Eley–Rideal-type mechanism. A comparison of measured and simulated data shows that the experimental results of the NO/O2 reaction are well described by the model. Kinetic parameters for the elementary reactions were taken from the literature or determined from a fit of the model to experimental data. To reduce the number of free parameters, we estimated the activation energy of O desorption for zero coverage and the corresponding linear constant α 2 by numerically simulating the \{O2\} \{TPD\} pattern. For the kinetic model of \{NO\} oxidation, the preexponential factors for \{NO2\} adsorption (68 m3 s−1 m−2) and \{NO\} oxidation (104 m3 s−1 m−2); the activation energies for \{NO\} desorption (114 kJ mol−1), \{NO2\} desorption (72 kJ mol−1), \{NO\} oxidation (35 kJ mol−1), and \{NO2\} dissociation (51 kJ mol−1); and the linear constant α 13 (14 kJ mol−1) are fitted. Furthermore, the calculated surface coverages provide evidence for the effect of CO, CO2, and \{H2O\} on the rate of \{NO\} oxidation.}}

This chapter examines the organization of lipid rafts and caveolae and their associated tracking pathways, and the role cholesterol plays in modifying the distribution, stability, and functions of these domains. The diversity of tracking pathways that initiate at caveolae and lipid rafts, as well as the variety of vesicle and non-vesicle pathways that provide transport and communications between these cell surface domains and multiple intracellular sites, indicates that there is no single prototypical pathway or cell type that represents all caveolae/lipid rafts. It is apparent that the structure and organization of lipid rafts in cells are as diverse and varied as the many functions that are associated with these structures. The cell requires a multiplicity of communication pathways in order to integrate its many responses to the wide variety of hormones, nutrients, and circulating factors that activate signal propagation and tracking within the cell.}}

Stages 3 and 4 are collectively referred to as slow-wave sleep. \{REM\} sleep may be subdivided into two stages: phasic and tonic. \{NREM\} and \{REM\} sleep are associated with dynamic changes in the autonomic nervous system and immune system. The NREM–REM sleep cycle occurs every 90 minutes and approximately 4–6 cycles occur per major sleep episode. The ratio of \{NREM\} sleep to \{REM\} sleep in each cycle varies during the course of the night. The early cycles are dominated by slow-wave sleep and the later cycles are dominated by \{REM\} sleep. The first episode of \{REM\} sleep may last only a few minutes and subsequent \{REM\} episodes progressively lengthen in duration during the course of the major sleep period.}}

Originally intended to model nerve cells and electrical amplifiers connected by fixed axons or wires, networks are used to model any ensemble of interacting elements. They are fast, robust, handle patterned data well, and require no external programming. They can be built of simple repeated modules using a limited set of rules. All these features make them ideal for application in living systems. Networks are the preferred architecture for all intelligent biosystems, from the cytoplasm to large ecosystems. The brain, which is the original inspiration for network theory, is just the latest version of a network paradigm that originated with the advent of life itself. Network theory allows a deeper insight into the intellect of biological machines, including the cancerous cell, the diseased brain, and the vertebrate immune system. The scale-free topology of living networks may afford an immediate insight into the way to target living networks, although its utility is limited by the inherent adaptability of living networks.}}

To assess the reasons for this inactivity of an otherwise crucial initiator caspase, we examined the ability for apoptosome assembly in 423-cells. Caspase-9 and Apaf-1 were expressed and cytochrome c released from mitochondria upon serum withdrawal. Although functional apoptosomes were assembled successfully in vitro, caspase-9 processing was found essentially refrained during apoptosis in 423-cells. Cell fractionation experiments revealed that sequestration of caspase-9 to cytoskeletal structures in 423-cells contributed to the observed impairment of apoptosome formation. Altogether, these findings provide evidence that serum starvation-induced apoptosis may occur independently of the intrinsic pathway and that caspase-9 sequestration potentially represents a novel biological antiapoptotic strategy.}}

A series of laws and standard systems have been formulated to the management of resource and environment throughout the world, the enforcement of them, however, is fairly weak, especially in developing countries. The reason for this phenomenon results from a combination of factors, including not only the weakness of the environmental and legal consciousness of manufacturers, but also the limits of generative capability in technology and capital. The chapter discusses resource management under a single regime and N regimes. It discusses the obstacles encountered for cross-border resource management and reviews the cross-border disputes at selected international rivers.

The advent of gene microarray technology in the post-genomic era has sensitized many biologists to the need for new quantitative methods of all kinds as part of the analysis of complex biological systems in general, and neuroscience in specific. Thus, both the need for formal models to capture the dynamics of networks of molecules and neurons and the need for sophisticated statistical measures to extract meaning from multi-dimensional data sets have made experimental biologists more interested than ever before in the tools that can be provided by theory of all kinds. Neuroscience is today ideally poised to profit optimally from the influx of talented theorists. Today more than ever it is clear that theory is necessary to catalyze paradigm shifts in the way people pose problems about the nervous system. These paradigm shifts will occur when smart experimentalists and smart theorists find common language and common ground to reveal how the glorious richness and detailed idiosyncrasies of neurobiological systems contribute to their ability to be at the same time plastic and stable. It is not yet obvious how networks can learn and develop without losing their ability to function as they are changed.}}

Treatment and prevention of cancer in transplant patients with an intentionally suppressed immune system are generally not considered an ideal situation because intact immunity is important for recognizing and destroying potentially neoplastic cells. Nonetheless, recent studies indicate that fighting tumors is not impossible under conditions of immune suppression, and in fact, immunosuppressive agents have been discovered that possess potent anticancer effects. In particular, one class of immunosuppressants, referred to as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (mTORi), has experimentally shown an ability to suppress the immune system to protect allografts from rejection while simultaneously inhibiting tumor growth. To gain a better understanding of this dual effect, we will review the key intracellular signaling pathways controlled by mTOR. We will discuss how mTORi affects the growth and survival of a variety of nonimmune cells, with a special emphasis on cancer.

abstract = {The retina is a layered structure that processes information in two stages. The outer plexiform layer (OPL) comprises the first stage and is where photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells interact synaptically. This is the synaptic layer where \{ON\} and \{OFF\} responses to light are formed, as well as the site where receptive field center and surround organization is first thought to occur. The inner plexiform layer (IPL) is where the second stage of synaptic interactions occurs. This synaptic layer is where subsequent visual processing occurs that may contribute to the formation of transient responses, which may underlie motion and direction sensitivity. In addition, synaptic interactions in the \{IPL\} may also contribute to the classical ganglion cell receptive field properties. This chapter will focus on the synapse and network properties at the \{IPL\} that sculpt light-evoked ganglion cell responses. These include synaptic mechanisms that may shape ganglion cell responses like desensitizing glutamate receptors and transporters, which remove glutamate from the synapse. Recent work suggests that inhibitory signaling at the \{IPL\} contributes to the surround receptive field organization of ganglion cells. A component of this amacrine cell inhibitory signaling is mediated by \{GABAC\} receptors, which are found on bipolar cell axon terminals in the IPL. Pharmacological experiments show that a component of the ganglion cell surround signal is mediated by these receptors, indicating that the ganglion cell center and surround receptive field organization is not formed entirely in the outer plexiform layer, as earlier thought.}}

Therefore, the recent advent of \{HV\} generator (Powerformer) that can be connected directly to the power transmission line has motivated the design of \{HV\} transformer (Dryformer) that performs one step transformation from transmission to distribution voltage levels. Since the dryformer will be connected directly to transmission lines, they will be subjected to transients resulting from direct and indirect lightning strikes as well as fast switching surges from Gas insulated circuit breakers. This paper presents the results of experimental studies on the cable winding power transformer (Dryformer) to study its response to various transients. Experimental investigations have been carried to obtain the transformer model parameters based on terminal measurement of admittance functions using Network Analyser, and hence for comparing the model predictions with experimentally obtained responses. The model has been successfully used in estimating the dryformer transient responses at its terminals due to surge application of various front times and peak amplitudes that are representative of lightning and switching caused transients. Experiment and simulation results show that there are considerable differences in the transient response characteristics of dryformer windings as compared to that of transformers with traditional winding design. These differences on transient responses are discussed in perspective of their basic difference in winding design features.}}

Several signalling molecules, most notably Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), retinoic acid (RA) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) have been implicated in the generation of these domains. Shh is secreted from the floor plate, the ventral most neural tube structure that consists of the medial (MFP) and the lateral floor plate (LFP). While the \{MFP\} is well characterized, organization and function of the \{LFP\} remains unclear. Here, we describe the novel homeobox gene nkx2.2b that is strongly expressed in the trunk \{LFP\} of zebrafish and thus represents a unique marker for the characterization of \{LFP\} formation and the identification of \{LFP\} deficient mutants. nkx2.2b and its paralog nkx2.2a (formerly known as nk2.2 and nkx2.2) arose by gene duplication in zebrafish. Both duplicates show significant differences in their expression patterns. For example, while prominent nkx2.2a expression has been described in the ventral brain [Barth, K.A., Wilson, S.W., 1995. Expression of zebrafish nk2.2 is influenced by sonic hedgehog/vertebrate hedgehog-1 and demarcates a zone of neuronal differentiation in the embryonic forebrain. Development 121, 1755–1768], hardly any expression can be found in the trunk LFP, which is in contrast to nkx2.2b. Overexpression, mutant and inhibitor analyses show that nkx2.2b expression in the \{LFP\} is up-regulated by Shh, but repressed by retinoids and ectopic islet-1 (isl1) expression. In contrast to previously described zebrafish trunk \{LFP\} markers, like e.g. tal2 or foxa2, nkx2.2b is exclusively expressed in the LFP. Thus, it represents a unique tool to analyse the mechanisms of ventral neural tube patterning in zebrafish.}}

Alkenes and alkanes were not formed directly from pentylamine and 2-hexylamine, but indirectly by elimination and hydrogenolysis of the alkanethiol intermediates, as confirmed by their secondary behavior and the similar alkene/alkane ratios in the simultaneous reactions of amines and thiols. Only 2-methyl-2-butylamine, with the \{NH2\} group attached to a tertiary carbon atom, produced alkenes as primary products by \{E1\} elimination. NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3 have a higher activity for the \{HDS\} of alkanethiols than does Mo/Al2O3; \{H2S\} has a negative influence. This shows that the thiols react on vacancies on the catalyst surface (Lewis acid sites).

Massively crosslinked arrays of tropoelastin (typically in association with microfibrils) contribute to tissue structural integrity and biomechanics through persistent flexibility, allowing for repeated stretch and relaxation cycles that critically depend on hydrated environments. Elastin sequences interact with multiple proteins found in or colocalized with microfibrils, and bind to elastogenic cell surface receptors. Knowledge of the major stages in elastin assembly has facilitated the construction of in vitro models of elastogenesis, leading to the identification of precise molecular regions that are critical to elastin-based protein interactions.}}

The ventral tegmental area and the lateral hypothalamus are likely structures where cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated-transcript peptides mediate both of these functions. Although lateral hypothalamus inputs to the ventral tegmental area have long been known, the chemical nature of this pathway remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we tested the possibility that cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated-transcript peptide-containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus project to the ventral tegmental area using the retrograde transport of cholera toxin subunit B combined with cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated-transcript peptide immunostaining. The largest density of retrogradely-labeled neurons in the hypothalamus after cholera toxin subunit B injection in the ventral tegmental area was found, ipsi- and contralaterally, in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area, although substantial numbers of retrogradely-labeled cells were also found in the medial preoptic area, lateral preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus and ventromedial hypothalamus. More than 80% of the retrogradely-labeled cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated-transcript peptide-immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus were found in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection sites. Although retrogradely-labeled neurons were seen in the amygdala, locus coeruleus, and raphe nucleus, none of them displayed cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated-transcript peptide immunoreactivity. Therefore, the hypothalamic projection to the ventral tegmental area provides a substrate whereby cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated-transcript peptides could mediate the rewarding aspects of feeding and psychomotor stimulant-like behaviors. These findings, combined with the fact that the lateral hypothalamus receives strong inputs from the shell of the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, suggest that these structures are part of integrative functional loops that control reward and appetitive behaviors.}}

Using extracellular single-unit recording in α-chloralose-urethane anesthetized cats, we have examined the discharge characteristics of \{NTS\} neurons to activation of somatic Aδ and C fiber afferents by skeletal muscle contraction evoked by electrical stimulation of lower lumbar/upper sacral ventral roots. Generally, somatic afferent stimulation evoked two distinct firing patterns. The first population (36/43 cells) increased their firing rate to brief somatic stimuli. A subset (21/27 cells) exhibited a rapid decay of their firing rate during sustained somatic stimulation. Peak instantaneous firing frequency (Fp) increased proportionally with the intensity of somatic stimulation (105±4 vs. 119±4 vs. 139±4 Hz, 10, 20 and 40 Hz, respectively, P&lt;0.0001), whereas steady-state firing frequency (Fss) was not altered (25±2 vs. 27±2 vs. 27±2 Hz, 10, 20 and 40 Hz, respectively, P=0.72). Two indices were derived to quantify the decay properties. The decay rate constant (obtained from exponential curve fitting) was not altered by stimulation frequency (461±10 vs. 442±14 vs. 429±26 ms, 10, 20 and 40 Hz, respectively, P=0.415), nor was the decay index (derived to express the percent reduction in firing rate with respect to the initial peak firing rate; 76±2 vs. 77±2 vs. 81±2%, 10, 20 and 40 Hz, respectively, P=0.187). In contrast, the second population (seven of 43 cells) decreased their firing rate to stimulation. Of the \{NTS\} neurons tested for barosensitivity (29/36), none responded to pressure stimulation. These results have identified a population of somatosensitive \{NTS\} neurons that exhibit rapid firing rate decay properties during sustained stimulation. However, this population could faithfully encode phasic excitation during rhythmic somatosensory input. These results are discussed in relation to the role of somatosensory input on baroreflex function.}}

Mechanically the cortex in these cells is organized as a polygonal mesh at two length scales: a coarse mesh with mesh element areas ∼0.5–10 μm2, and a finer mesh with areas &lt;0.5 μm2. These meshes appear to be intertwined, which may have interesting implications for the mechanical properties of the cell. Correlated AFM-CFM experiments and pharmacological treatments reveal that actin and vimentin are components of the coarse mesh, but microtubules are not mechanical components of the \{BPAEC\} apical cortex.}}

Background Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) remains the most important cause of late renal graft loss. However, the mechanism for graft dysfunction and the process of the development of \{CAN\} are not well understood. This study examined the role of microvascular injury in the development of CAN. Methods We studied renal biopsies obtained from grafts with \{CAN\} (N = 79) and pretransplant control kidneys (N = 20). Microvascular injury was examined morphologically, and was correlated with interstitial fibrosis, glomerular sclerosis, graft function, and the severity of CAN. The humoral and cellular immunity involved in \{CAN\} were examined by C4d, CD3, and TIA-1 staining. Results In all the cases of CAN, microvascular injury was evident with or without CD3-positive T cells, TIA-1–positive cytotoxic cells, and/or C4d+ complement deposition. Irrespective of chronic rejection (N = 14), C4d+ chronic humoral rejection (N = 6), or other CAN, the development process of \{CAN\} was characterized by injury and progressive loss of identifiable peritubular capillaries (PTCs) accompanied with the development of interstitial fibrosis. Injured \{PTCs\} were characterized morphologically by the process of angioregression with the presence of apoptotic cells, lamination of the basement membrane, and loss of PTCs. The low number of \{PTCs\} correlated significantly with the severity of \{CAN\} (r=-0.74, P &lt; 0.001), the development of interstitial fibrosis (r=-0.75, P &lt; 0.001), graft dysfunction (r=-0.69, P &lt; 0.001), and also correlated weakly with proteinuria (r=-0.45, P &lt; 0.05). In the glomeruli, capillary loss significantly correlated with the degree of glomerular sclerosis (r=-0.66, P &lt; 0.001) and proteinuria (r=-0.65, P &lt; 0.001), but did not correlate with the severity of \{CAN\} (r=-0.24, P &gt; 0.05) or graft dysfunction (r=-0.32, P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion \{CAN\} was characterized by progressive injury to the renal microvasculature and the development of renal scarring. In particular, injury, angioregression and progressive loss of the \{PTC\} network strongly contributed to the development of interstitial fibrosis and graft dysfunction in CAN, and might play a crucial role in the development of CAN.}}

The latter has been shown to be involved in cancer growth: reduced \{GJIC\} often is associated with increased tumor growth or with de-differentiation processes. Disturbances of \{GJIC\} in the heart can cause arrhythmia, while in brain electrical activity during seizures seems to be propagated via gap junction channels. Many diseases or pathophysiological conditions seem to be associated with alterations of gap junction protein expression. Thus, depending on the target disease opening or closure of gap junctions may be of interest, or alteration of connexin expression. \{GJIC\} can be affected acutely by changing gap junction conductance or – more chronic – by altering connexin expression and membrane localisation.

These interactions, which permit high-order discriminations among possible core states, confer selective advantages on organisms possessing them by linking current perceptual events to a past history of value-dependent learning. Here, we assess the consistency of \{ND\} with 16 widely recognized properties of consciousness, both physiological (for example, consciousness is associated with widespread, relatively fast, low amplitude interactions in the thalamocortical system), and phenomenal (for example, consciousness involves the existence of a private flow of events available only to the experiencing subject).

abstract = {The long-term history of glaciation along the East Antarctic Wilkes Land margin, from the time of the first arrival of the ice sheet to the margin, through the significant periods of Cenozoic climate change is inferred using an integrated geophysical and geological approach. We postulate that the first arrival of the ice sheet to the Wilkes Land margin resulted in the development of a large unconformity (WL-U3) between 33.42 and 30 Ma during the early Oligocene cooling climate trend. Above WL-U3, substantial margin progradation takes place with early glacial strata (e.g., outwash deposits) deposited as low-angle prograding foresets by temperate glaciers. The change in geometry of the prograding wedge across unconformity WL-U8 is interpreted to represent the transition, at the end of the middle Miocene “climatic optimum” (14–10 Ma), from a subpolar regime with dynamic ice sheets (i.e., ice sheets come and go) to a regime with persistent but oscillatory ice sheets. The steep foresets above WL-U8 likely consist of ice proximal sediments (i.e., water-lain till and debris flows) deposited when grounded ice-sheets extended into the shelf. On the continental rise, shelf progradation above WL-U3 results in an up-section increase in the energy of the depositional environment (i.e., seismic facies indicative of more proximal turbidite and of bottom contour current deposition from the deposition of the lower WL-S5 sequence to WL-S7). Maximum rates of sediment delivery to the rise occur during the development of sequences WL-S6 and WL-S7, which we infer to be of middle Miocene age. During deposition of the two uppermost sequences, WL-S8 and WL-S9, there is a marked decrease in the sediment supply to the lower continental rise and a shift in the depocenters to more proximal areas of the margin. We believe WL-S8 records sedimentation during the final transition from a dynamic to a persistent but oscillatory ice sheet in this margin (14–10 Ma). Sequence WL-S9 forms under a polar regime during the Pliocene–Pleistocene, when most sediment delivered to the margin is trapped in the outer shelf and slope-forming steep prograding wedges. During the warmer but still polar, Holocene, biogenic sediment accumulates quickly in deep inner-shelf basins during the high-stand intervals. These sediments contain an ultrahigh resolution (annual to millennial) record of climate variability. Validation of our inferences about the nature and timing of Wilkes Land glacial sequences can be achieved by deep sampling (i.e., using IODP-type techniques). The most complete record of the long-term history of glaciation in this margin can be obtained by sampling both (1) the shelf, which contains the direct (presence or no presence of ice) but low-resolution record of glaciation, and (2) the rise, which contains the distal (cold vs. warm) but more complete record of glaciation. The Wilkes Land margin is the only known Antarctic margin where the presumed “onset” of glaciation unconformity (WL-U3) can be traced from shelf to the abyssal plain, allowing links between the proximal and the distal records of glaciation to be established. Additionally, the eastern segment of the Wilkes Land margin may be more sensitive to climate change because the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is grounded below sea level. Therefore, the Wilkes Land margin is not only an ideal location to obtain the long-term \{EAIS\} history but also to obtain the shorter-term record of ice sheet fluctuations at times that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is thought to have been more stable (after 15 Ma-recent).}}

Locally active tectonics, sea level variations and ecological factors combined to control the development and distribution of foramol carbonate factories as well as the remobilisation and the redeposition of carbonate sediments into the adjacent deeper areas. In the Isili Basin, foramol/rhodalgal carbonate factories developed on submerged structural highs which resulted from pre- and syn-sedimentary tectonics. These carbonate factories were periodically shaved mainly during negative sea level oscillations and the sediments removed were funnelled towards the basin through a complex submarine channel network which included a tributary belt, one main channel (Isili Channel) and the related fan. The Isili Channel is up to 1 km wide, 60–100 m deep and includes two stacked channel complexes each built up by several minor-order channel units. Complex strata geometries characterise the Isili Channel and its related architectural elements (e.g., overbank, levee, margin and channel thalweg) which also include up to 15 m high bedforms. Individual channel complexes were temporally related to individual fan systems whose spatial distribution and internal geometry were strongly controlled by the type and rate of sediment accumulation and, in turn, by relative sea level oscillations. Facies associations include sandy to cobble-sized gravity flow and bottom current deposits as well as megabreccias characterised by impressive displaced and tilted blocks which resulted from major channel margin collapses. Detailed analysis has led to the reconstruction of the internal geometry and depositional architecture of these carbonate bodies and to the determination of the main controlling factors. The dimension and distribution of channel and channel-related depositional bodies have been accurately determined. This information provides a useful tool to analyse less extensively exposed analogues and to model foramol shelf to basin transitions and related channel and fan systems.}}

This is achieved through an “information bottleneck principle” (IB) that provides a general computational framework for “reverse engineering” of complex systems, merely from their input-output statistics. It also quantifies the efficiency of systems through their optimal complexity-accuracy tradeoff. The chapter also reviews of some of the application of \{IB\} to clustering, dimensionality reduction, and multivariate data analysis using the language of graphical models. The simplest application of \{IB\} is as a clustering method, where the variable T has a finite cardinality that represent discrete clusters of X that are informative on Y. When applied to natural language corpus, such as Lang's 20-newsgroup database an intriguing scaling phenomena that demonstrates the importance of the full complexity-accuracy tradeoff is obtained.}}

We and others have shown that \{ARH\} projections do not fully develop until the 3rd postnatal week in the rodent. This is in stark contrast to the nonhuman primate (NHP) in which \{ARH\} projections develop during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. This species difference suggests that maternal diet and health are likely key factors for the development of \{ARH\} projections in the primate, whereas the postnatal environment (i.e., diet) would be more important in the rodent. Furthermore, pertubations in these circuits during critical periods of development may have long-term consequences on feeding behavior and body weight management. Our group has used a rat model of overfeeding and underfeeding specifically during the postnatal period to begin to investigate the metabolic adaptions that may cause developmental abnormalities in the hypothalamic circuitry. While the overfed animals become obese as adults and the underfed maintain a lean phenotype, both models display low basal insulin and \{IGFII\} levels as adults. Furthermore, both models have abnormal expression of several key genes in peripheral metabolic tissue that are suggestive of changes in sympathetic outflow. Human studies show that gestational diabetes can also contribute to the development of obesity and diabetes in children; however, the mechanism is unknown. Since the critical periods for the development of hypothalamic circuits are different between rodents and primates our group has begun studies using \{NHP\} model to determine if maternal obesity/diabetes causes abnormalities in the development of metabolic systems, including the brain, in the offspring. To do this we have placed female \{NHPs\} on either a control diet or a high fat/calorie diet to induce obesity and diabetes. We have characterized the onset of insulin resistance and hyperleptinemia in these animals over the last 2½ years and have collected offspring. Ongoing studies will investigate the metabolic abnormalities in these offspring.}}

The optimization problem is established by considering that the instantaneous production of the gas/oil network must optimally satisfy a given demand. Non-linear behavior and reverse flow is assumed for wells and cubic equations of state are used to estimate thermodynamic properties. The resulting model contains differential and algebraic equations for a given fixed topology of interconnected wells coupled with surface pipeline networks. The model combines \{DASSL\} to solve the inner set of differential–algebraic equations, and Knitro to solve both the optimization problem and the overall set of non-linear equations. The good performance of the model and the numerical strategy is illustrated with real cases of study.}}

After its introduction in the early 1970s, the calculus and system definition for materials and energy flow analysis have been diversified, causing problems in comparing the results of different studies. This paper uses a materials and energy flow analysis framework that is a generalization of the major approaches in ecology and economics to illuminate the differences and similarities between the approaches on the basis of a set of consistent principles. The analysis often shows that seemingly different calculus and interpretations employed by different approaches eventually lead to the same outcome. Some issues of interpretations that conflict or require cautious interpretation are further elaborated. A numerical example is presented to test the generalized framework, applying major analytical tools developed by other approaches. Finally, some parallels, convergents, and divergents of the perspectives of ecology and economics and their implications for endogenized resources economy are discussed as they are reflected in the materials and energy flow analysis frameworks.}}

Without the introduction of equalisation mechanisms, these expenses will increase inequalities between different parts of the urban population. As confirmed by 2 Latin American case studies in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and La Paz Bolivia, the quality of urban environment depends directly on improving living conditions for the resident population. The aim is to assist the poor in developing a rubbish disposal service for the families living in the informal settlements of La Paz, or to extend water supply to the poorer areas on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The collective benefits of these “innovations” are self-evident. However, understanding the environmental issues involved, and evaluating the social impact of these innovations, means examining what motivates their implementation. The first difficulty was in finding financial and economic information on the global cost of the new technologies, due to the lack of managerial culture and the discretional attitude of private enterprises and public administration. A second observation is that the social dimension of the environmental upgrading process in Latin America cities has been neglected by the main urban decision-makers. In all the contexts, the evolution of the projects’ implementation clearly demonstrates that social issues cannot be dissociated from political ones. Although the players themselves often find it difficult to estimate economic costs, these are nonetheless real and represent burdens that should be distributed equitably among the beneficiaries of services; but which are, in practice, often viewed in terms of profit. This leads to conflicts between different population groups, the political authorities and private intermediaries. Rather than viewing technological action as an unique “source” of innovation, we must consider its global dimension via the social practices it generates. On the other hand, we should reposition every specific event in its immediate environment and see how it reflects contemporary macro-social processes, in a world of “globalisation”.}}

These ectopic \{GCs\} (EGCs) display robust spontaneous and evoked excitatory activity. However, the pattern of afferent input they receive has not been fully defined. This study used electron microscopic immunolabeling to quantitatively evaluate mossy fiber (MF) input to \{EGCs\} since \{MFs\} densely innervate the hilus normally and undergo sprouting in many animal models of epilepsy. \{EGC\} dendrites were examined in tissue from epileptic rats that had initially been treated with pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus and subsequently had spontaneous seizures. \{MF\} terminals were labeled with a zinc transporter-3 antibody, and calbindin immunoreactivity was used to label hilar \{EGCs\} and \{GC\} layer GCs. The pattern of input provided by sprouted \{MF\} terminals to \{EGC\} dendrites was then compared to the pattern of \{MF\} input to \{GC\} dendrites in the inner molecular layer (IML), where most sprouted fibers are thought to project. Analysis of \{EGC\} dendrites demonstrated that \{MF\} terminals represented their predominant source of afferent input: they comprised 63% of all terminals and, on average, occupied 40% and 29% of the dendritic surface in the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus, respectively, forming frequent synapses. These measures of connectivity were significantly greater than comparable values for \{MF\} innervation of \{GC\} dendrites located in the \{IML\} of the same tissue sections. Thus, \{EGCs\} develop a pattern of synaptic connections that could help explain their previously identified predisposition to discharge in epileptiform bursts and suggest that they play an important role in the generation of seizure activity in the dentate gyrus.}}

We demonstrate that complete feature ranking followed by selection can lead to appreciable reductions in data dimensionality, with significant improvements in the implementation and performance of classifiers for medical diagnosis. We describe a novel approach for ranking all features according to their predictive quality using properties unique to learning algorithms based on the group method of data handling (GMDH). An abductive network training algorithm is repeatedly used to select groups of optimum predictors from the feature set at gradually increasing levels of model complexity specified by the user. Groups selected earlier are better predictors. The process is then repeated to rank features within individual groups. The resulting full feature ranking can be used to determine the optimum feature subset by starting at the top of the list and progressively including more features until the classification error rate on an out-of-sample evaluation set starts to increase due to overfitting. The approach is demonstrated on two medical diagnosis datasets (breast cancer and heart disease) and comparisons are made with other feature ranking and selection methods. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis is used to compare classifier performance. At default model complexity, dimensionality reduction of 22 and 54% could be achieved for the breast cancer and heart disease data, respectively, leading to improvements in the overall classification performance. For both datasets, considerable dimensionality reduction introduced no significant reduction in the area under the \{ROC\} curve. GMDH-based feature selection results have also proved effective with neural network classifiers.}}

Therefore, precise regulation of local mitotic activity seems to be basic for proper embryogenesis. Here, I report on bottle cells as an early non-mitotic cell population in the Xenopus gastrula. Endogenous and activin/BVg1-induced ectopic bottle cells do not proliferate. Overexpression of the mitosis-promoting phosphatase cdc25C increases the proliferation rate and interferes with bottle cell formation whereas the phosphatase-dead mutant cdc25C(C457A) does not. Cdc25C also affects other gastrulation processes such as epiboly, vegetal rotation or tissue separation as inferred from histological inspection of early gastrulae. Double stainings of gsc/Xbra transcripts and mitotic nuclei in ectopic and endogenous lips demonstrated that non-mitotic cells occur in the bottle cell region and, to a lesser extent, in the gsc domain which both are indicative of high TGF-β signalling. In contrast, the Xbra-region and the remainder of the animal cap appear to be permissive for higher rates of cell proliferation. These data suggest inhibition of cell proliferation by high levels of activin-type signals and a close link of mesodermal and mitotic patterning. Finally, coexpression of eFGF together with activin/BVg1 interferes with TGF-β-induced bottle cell formation. This inhibitory effect correlates with increased cell proliferation as compared to embryos injected with activin/BVg1 alone. Taken together, these data suggest that TGF-β and \{FGF\} signals play antagonistic roles in bottle cell formation and the spatial control of the cell cycle in early Xenopus gastrulae.}}

To identify novel genes with a cell-death-related function in neurons, we screened 4,964 Drosophila \{GS\} lines, in which one or two genes from much of the Drosophila genome can be overexpressed. Approximately 0.68% of the \{GS\} lines produced phenotypes involving a loss of postmitotic neurons. Of these, we identified and characterized the endd2 gene, which encodes the Drosophila ortholog of Sec61α (DSec61α), an endoplasmic reticulum protein with protein translocation activity. Ectopic expression of DSec61α caused neural cell death accompanied by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which was mediated by DSec61α's translocon activity. This supported our previous observation that the DSec61α translocon contributes to expanded polyglutamine-mediated neuronal toxicity, which is also associated with ubiquitinated protein accumulation. These data suggest that the translocon may be a novel component of neural cell death and degeneration pathways. Our approach can be used to identify potential neurotoxic factors within the whole genome, which will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of various types of cell death, including those associated with human neurodegenerative diseases.}}

abstract = {In this paper we evaluate the possibility of detecting, for the first time, the surface magnetic field of Jupiter (∼1 bar level) by observing the change of linear polarization induced by the Hanle effect on the H Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line of the planet. We find that, indeed, the Hanle effect, which results from the interaction between a local magnetic field and the atomic polarization induced by absorption of anisotropic radiation, is sensitive to relatively weak values of the strength of the magnetic fields expected on planets. First, we show that for the Lyα emission backscattered by atomic H in the presence of a magnetic field, the Hanle effect is polarizing. This new result is in total contrast to the depolarizing effect predicted and observed for emission lines scattered at right angles in solar prominences. Additionally, to estimate the polarization rate for the case of Jupiter, we have considered three magnetic field models: a dipole field for reference, an O 4 based model [Connerney, J.E.P., 1981. The magnetic field of Jupiter—A generalized inverse approach. J. Geophys. Res. 86, 7679–7693], and finally, an O 6 based model [Khurana, K.K., 1997. Euler potential models of Jupiter's magnetospheric field. J. Geophys. Res. 102, 11295–11306]. In all models, we show that for the jovian backscattered Lyα line, the Hanle effect does enhance the Lyα linear polarization; the polarization rate may exceed 2% at specific regions of the jovian disc, making detection possible either remotely or from an orbiter around Jupiter. In general, depending on the instrumental sensitivity and the observing strategy used, we show that accurate mapping of the linear polarization rate at the planetary surface (thermosphere) or off-disc (corona) may provide a rather accurate estimate of the jovian total magnetic field strength on large area scales.}}

abstract = {We identified the gob-1 (gut-obstructed) gene in a forward genetic screen for intestinal defects in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. gob-1 loss of function results in early larval lethality, at least in part because of a blocked intestinal lumen and consequent starvation. The gob-1 gene is first expressed in the 8E cell stage of the embryonic intestine, and the \{GATA\} factor ELT-2 is sufficient but not necessary for this early phase of gob-1 expression; gob-1 expression later becomes widespread in embryos, larvae, and adults. GOB-1 is a member of the HAD-like hydrolase superfamily and shows a robust and specific phosphatase activity for the substrate trehalose-6-phosphate. Trehalose is a glucose disaccharide found in bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, and nematodes but not in mammals. Trehalose plays a number of critical roles such as providing flexible energy reserves and contributing to thermal and osmotic stress resistance. In budding yeast and in plants, the intermediate in trehalose synthesis, trehalose-6-phosphate, has additional critical but less well-defined roles in controlling glycolysis and carbohydrate metabolism. Strong loss-of-function mutants in the C. elegans tps-1 and tps-2 genes (which encode the two trehalose phosphate synthases responsible for trehalose-6-phosphate synthesis) completely suppress the lethality associated with gob-1 loss of function. The suppression of gob-1 lethality by ablation of TPS-1 and TPS-2, the upstream enzymes in the trehalose synthesis pathway, suggests that gob-1 lethality results from a toxic build-up of the intermediate trehalose-6-phosphate, not from an absence of trehalose. GOB-1 is the first trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase to be identified in nematodes and, because of its associated lethality and distinctive sequence properties, provides a new and attractive target for anti-parasitic drugs.}}

Previously, we showed that targeted disruption of Wnt5a results in over-branching of the epithelium and thickening of the interstitium in embryonic lungs. In this study, we generated and characterized transgenic mice with lung-specific over-expression of Wnt5a from the SpC promoter. Over-expression of Wnt5a interfered with normal epithelial–mesenchymal interactions resulting in reduced epithelial branching and dilated distal airways. During early lung development, over-expression of Wnt5a in the epithelium resulted in increased Fgf10 in the mesenchyme and decreased Shh in the epithelium. Both levels and distribution of \{SHH\} receptor, Ptc were reduced in SpC-Wnt5a transgenic lungs and were reciprocally correlated to changes of Fgf10 in the mesenchyme, suggesting that \{SHH\} signaling is decreased by over-expression of Wnt5a. Cultured mesenchyme-free epithelial explants from SpC-Wnt5a transgenic lungs responded abnormally to recombinant \{FGF10\} supplied uniformly in the Matrigel with dilated branch tips that mimic the in vivo phenotype. In contrast, chemotaxis of transgenic epithelial explants towards a directional \{FGF10\} source was inhibited. These suggest that over-expression of Wnt5a disrupts epithelial-response to FGF10. In conclusion, Wnt5a regulates \{SHH\} and \{FGF10\} signaling during lung development.}}

The inflammatory responses seen in the brain parenchyma differ from those elicited in the periphery, ventricles and meninges. However, although an inflammatory component has been associated with many \{CNS\} diseases, the differences among parenchymal inflammatory responses in different brain regions have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we performed a systematic comparison of the effects of a common pro-inflammatory stimulus, IL-1β, on the hippocampus, substantia nigra, striatum and cortex. We determined various responses, including cytokine mRNA induction, glial activation, immune cell infiltration and changes in neuronal integrity, in both injected and adjacent regions 1 and 6 days after the injection of IL-1β. We found that the mRNA for TGF-β was up-regulated in a region-specific manner after IL-1β administration. Contrary to its response in the periphery, IL-1α showed no detectable induction in the tested parenchymal regions. In addition, cytokine induction was also sometimes observed in regions distant from the site of injection. Interestingly, IL-1β-mediated neurodegeneration was observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but not in the other tested regions. The cellular recruitment mediated by IL-1 β injection consisted mainly of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), which correlated with IL-1β mRNA induction even in regions far from the injection site. These results indicate that various parenchymal regions show different inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in response to IL-1β. Taken together, our results provide a more precise picture of regional inflammation in the brain and should provide a basis for differential interpretation of results based on regional inflammatory differences.}}

Although incentives are in place in the \{UK\} to encourage innovation in these technologies, system failures—or ‘gaps’—are identified in moving technologies along the innovation chain, preventing their successful commercialisation. Sustained investment will be needed for these technologies to achieve their potential. It is argued that a stable and consistent policy framework is required to help create the conditions for this. In particular, such a framework should be aimed at improving risk/reward ratios for demonstration and pre-commercial stage technologies. This would enhance positive expectations, stimulate learning effects leading to cost reductions, and increase the likelihood of successful commercialisation.}}

Higham showed that the small-world phenomenon arising in a ring network of N nodes can be modelled by a Markov chain which depends on a parameter ϵ of the form ϵ = K/Nα, where K ⩾ 0 and α &gt; 1. The parameter can be viewed as a transitional factor interpolating between the completely local and completely global configurations of the network. Higham analyzed the Markov chain model by a combination of matrix perturbation theory and finite difference approximations to an underlying boundary value problem. Using such tools he obtained asymptotic results for the limiting case when N is sufficiently large. Furthermore, for large N, Higham verified the small-world phenomenon on the network in the case when α = 3. Motivated by Higham’s work, we show that the Markov chain of the small-world model can be investigated more completely by direct matrix-theoretic methods which produces exact results for all N and for all ϵ. Our results therefore allow a fuller examination of the behavior of the small-world phenomenon in the Markov chain model for small to moderate values of N and for all α &gt; 1.}}

Here, single-particle electron cryomicroscopy has been used to study the mechanism of \{HCV\} IRES-mediated initiation. A HeLa in vitro translation system was used to assemble human IRES-80S ribosome complexes under near physiological conditions; these were stalled before elongation. Domain 2 of the \{HCV\} \{IRES\} is bound to the tRNA exit site, touching the \{L1\} stalk of the 60S subunit, suggesting a mechanism for the removal of the \{HCV\} \{IRES\} in the progression to elongation. Domain 3 of the \{HCV\} \{IRES\} positions the initiation codon in the ribosomal mRNA binding cleft by binding helix 28 at the head of the 40S subunit. The comparison with the previously published binary 40S-HCV \{IRES\} complex reveals structural rearrangements in the two pseudoknot structures of the \{HCV\} \{IRES\} in translation initiation.}}

Such networks are expected to detect and react to multiple impacts and damage over a wide range of impact energies. In particular, we address the problem of forming a reconfigurable network (a minimum spanning tree) connecting cells that detected non-critical impacts, in presence of connectivity disruptions caused by critical impacts. The presented algorithm is based on the ant colony metaphor and may be complemented by gradient-based techniques. In addition, we measure the robustness of impact networks and present quantitative metrics that clearly identify phase transitions in network connectivity, separating chaotic dynamics from ordered and robust patterns.}}

abstract = {The formation of incised valleys on continental shelves is generally attributed to fluvial erosion under low sea level conditions. However, there are exceptions. A multibeam sonar survey at the northern end of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, adjacent to the southern edge of the Gulf of Papua, mapped a shelf valley system up to 220 m deep that extends for more than 90 km across the continental shelf. This is the deepest shelf valley yet found in the Great Barrier Reef and is well below the maximum depth of fluvial incision that could have occurred under a − 120 m, eustatic sea level low-stand, as what occurred on this margin during the last ice age. These valleys appear to have formed by a combination of reef growth and tidal current scour, probably in relation to a sea level at around 30–50 m below its present position. Tidally incised depressions in the valley floor exhibit closed bathymetric contours at both ends. Valley floor sediments are mainly calcareous muddy, gravelly sand on the middle shelf, giving way to well-sorted, gravely sand containing a large relict fraction on the outer shelf. The valley extends between broad platform reefs and framework coral growth, which accumulated through the late Quaternary, coincides with tidal current scour to produce steep-sided (locally vertical) valley walls. The deepest segments of the valley were probably the sites of lakes during the last ice age, when Torres Strait formed an emergent land-bridge between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Numerical modeling predicts that the strongest tidal currents occur over the deepest, outer-shelf segment of the valley when sea level is about 40–50 m below its present position. These results are consistent with a Pleistocene age and relict origin of the valley. Based on these observations, we propose a new conceptual model for the formation of tidally incised shelf valleys. Tidal erosion on meso- to macro-tidal, rimmed carbonate shelves is enhanced during sea level rise and fall when a tidal, hydraulic pressure gradient is established between the shelf-lagoon and the adjacent ocean basin. Tidal flows attain a maximum, and channel incision is greatest, when a large hydraulic pressure gradient coincides with small channel cross sections. Our tidal-incision model may explain the observation of other workers, that sediment is exported from the Great Barrier Reef shelf to the adjacent ocean basins during intermediate (rather than last glacial maximum) low-stand, sea level positions. The model may apply to other rimmed shelves, both modern and ancient.}}

This study characterized and compared the composition (saplings and trees) and structure (gaps, foliage distribution, tree diameter and density, snags and coarse woody debris) of old-growth stands (OG), 12-year-old selection cuts (SC), and 28–33-year-old diameter-limit cuts (DLC) in sugar maple (Acer saccharum)-dominated northern hardwood stands. Results showed marked structural differences between \{OG\} and harvested stands, with stronger differences between \{DLC\} and \{OG\} than between \{SC\} and OG. The synchronized formation of numerous canopy openings in harvested stands induced a massive post-harvest recruitment of advance regeneration in both \{SC\} and \{DLC\} that created a dense foliage layer in the understory. Large living trees (dbh &gt; 39.1 cm) and defective trees were less numerous in \{SC\} than OG, which can have a detrimental impact on species dependent on these structural elements, and on the future availability and characteristics of coarse woody debris. Relatively few compositional differences were noticed among stand types, although a greater proportion of mid-tolerant species was found in the post-harvest recruitment cohorts of harvested stands compared to OG, and a lower proportion of beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) saplings was observed in \{DLC\} compared to \{OG\} and SC. We argue that even if selection cutting is closer to the natural disturbance regime of hardwood forests than diameter-limit cutting, and therefore representing progress toward the development and implementation of a natural-disturbance-based management, a recurring application of selection cutting might lead to a homogenization of forest structure and composition, a reduction of key structural features and a reduction in biological diversity at both the stand and landscape scales. Some management recommendations are proposed.}}

However, \{CNS\} research and development are associated with significant challenges: it takes longer to get a \{CNS\} drug to market (12–16 years) compared with a non-CNS drug (10–12 years) and there is a higher attrition rate for \{CNS\} drug candidates than for non-CNS drug candidates. This is attributable to a variety of factors, including the complexity of the brain, the liability of \{CNS\} drugs to cause \{CNS\} side effects, and the requirement of \{CNS\} drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Induction of \{PTEN\} sensitizes cells to \{EGFR\} inhibition, and the combination causes synergistic apoptosis. Synergy is due to inhibition of two parallel pathways that phosphorylate the proapoptotic protein \{BAD\} at distinct sites. Serine 112 phosphorylation is EGFR/MEK/MAPK dependent, whereas serine 136 phosphorylation is PI3K/Akt dependent. Either phosphorylation is sufficient to sequester \{BAD\} to 14-3-3. \{BAD\} is released and apoptosis is induced only if both serines are dephosphorylated in response to inhibition of both pathways. Reduction of \{BAD\} expression by \{RNA\} interference prevents apoptosis in response to pathway inhibition. Thus, \{BAD\} integrates the antiapoptotic effects of both pathways.

abstract = {Objective To study the presence of electrophysiological indicators of remaining cortical functions in patients with persistent vegetative state (PVS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). Previous electrophysiological and \{PET\} data indicated that some \{PVS\} patients have partially intact cortical processing functions. However, it remains unclear whether the reported patients were representative for \{PVS\} population or just some exceptional cases. Methods: Event-related brain responses to stimuli of different complexity levels, recorded in 98 patients with extremely severe diffuse brain injuries, 50 of which in PVS. Four main indicators of cortical functions were: (i) N1–P2 complex as an index of simple, undifferentiated cortical processing; (ii) mismatch negativity as an index of pre-attentive, probably unconscious, cortical orientation; (iii) \{P3\} wave as an index of deep cortical analysis of physical stimuli, and (iv) brain responses to semantic stimuli. Results Cortical responses were found in all \{PVS\} patients with a background \{EEG\} activity &gt;4 Hz. All responses investigated, including those to semantic stimuli that indicated comprehension of meaning, occurred significantly above chance, though less frequently than in patients with severe brain injuries who were conscious. Conclusions Cortical responses were lacking in most patients with severe \{EEG\} slowing (&lt;4 Hz). Follow-up data revealed that the presence of a mismatch negativity, a short disease duration, and the traumatic etiology were related to a better outcome. Significance The data show that in a subpopulation of \{PVS\} patients with preserved thalamocortical feedback connections, remaining cortical information processing is a consistent finding and may even involve semantic levels of processing.}}

Unlike centralized traffic information systems, the proposed system does not need public infrastructure investment as a prerequisite for implementation. Due to the complexity of the proposed system, simulation is selected as the primary approach in the feasibility studies. A simulation framework is built based on an existing microscopic traffic simulation model for the simulation studies. The critical questions for building the proposed market-driven system are examined both from communication requirements and traffic engineering points of view. Traffic information propagation both in freeway and arterial networks via information exchange among IVC-equipped vehicles is tested within the simulation framework. Results on the probability of successful \{IVC\} and traffic information propagation distance obtained from the simulation studies are generated and analyzed under incident-free and incident conditions for various roadway formats and parameter combinations. Comparisons between the speed of the incident information wave and the speed of the corresponding traffic shock wave due to the incident are analyzed for different scenarios as the most crucial aspect of the information propagation as a potential foundation for application in such a decentralized traffic information system.}}

This study aims to derive such information from space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Estimates of the backscattering coefficient were extracted from ERS-1 \{SAR\} and ERS-2 \{SAR\} \{PRI\} imagery of four intertidal flats in the Westerschelde (southwest Netherlands). They were related to field measurements of surface roughness, moisture conditions and sediment texture. The field data were also used as input to the backscattering model IEM. The data and model predictions show that on the intertidal flats, backscattering depends mainly on vertical surface roughness, with rougher surfaces associated with more backscattering. Surface roughness, mainly determined by the ripple structure of the bed, decreased with the amount of mud in the sediment. This resulted in a significant negative correlation between backscattering and mud content, and a significant positive correlation between backscattering and median grain-size of the sediment. Sediment texture was also correlated with the volumetric moisture content of the sediment, with finer sediments being associated with higher moisture contents. However, moisture contents were generally high, and therefore the backscatter signal was not sensitive to differences in moisture content. The relationships allowed the development of regression models for the prediction of surface characteristics from \{SAR\} imagery, from which maps of, for example, mud content, have been derived.}}

Unlike oxidative stress which is characterized by a macroscopic shift in cellular redox potentials and usually accompanied by oxygen radical induced damage, redox regulation involves subtle and more chemically defined oxidations of short duration. Most important is the reductive component as a necessary part of a reversible regulatory process. Examples of redox regulation occur during early stages of the immune response, in hypoxia or in endothelial dysfunction. Persistent oxidative events together with a decline in the cellular reduction potential lead to oxidative stress as is seen in the pathophysiology of sepsis, reperfusion damage, atherosclerosis and diabetes. Oxidative signals involve superoxide and nitric oxide as the main players which form a system of oxidizing, nitrating or nitrosating species leading to posttranslational modifications of proteins. Modern techniques of immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry allow a correlation of protein modification, e.g., disulfide, S-oxide, S-nitroso or nitrotyrosine formation, with enzyme activities and cellular responses. In this commentary, examples of the control of prostanoid synthesis by the NO/O2− system are described. Redox regulation represents an interesting challenge for the development of drugs that modulate the oxidative trigger mechanisms or enforce the reductive pathways.}}

The small \{GTPases\} Rab5 and Rab7 are key determinants of early and late endosomes, organizing effector proteins into specific membrane subdomains. Whether such Rab machineries are indefinitely maintained on membranes or can disassemble in the course of cargo transport is an open question. Here, we combined novel image-analysis algorithms with fast live-cell imaging. We found that the level of Rab5 dynamically fluctuates on individual early endosomes, linked by fusion and fission events into a network in time. Within it, degradative cargo concentrates in progressively fewer and larger endosomes that migrate from the cell periphery to the center where Rab5 is rapidly replaced with Rab7. The class C VPS/HOPS complex, an established \{GEF\} for Rab7, interacts with Rab5 and is required for Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion. Our results reveal unexpected dynamics of Rab domains and suggest Rab conversion as the mechanism of cargo progression between early and late endosomes.}}

When this flight share is large, most of the congestion created by additional flight is internalized by the carrier, justifying a low toll, and conversely when the flight share is small.

This paper proposes a complementary mechanism, called link-indexed statistical traffic predictor (LISP) to improve \{IEEE\} 802.11 PSM. \{LISP\} employs a simple, light-weight traffic prediction method to speed up the delivery of packets along the end-to-end path. By seeking the inherent correlation between ATIM_ACKs and incoming traffic, nodes en route stay awake in the beacon intervals in which packets are anticipated to arrive. As the result, a “freeway” is bridged for packets to rapidly traverse the route. Meanwhile, the number of duty cycles is reduced and more energy is conserved. We have conducted analytical and simulation studies and demonstrated the effectiveness of LISP. The impact of various factors is investigated, including traffic load, number of hops (of routes which connections traverse), \{ATIM\} window size and packet size, in both tandem networks and networks of arbitrary topologies.}}

The study also extends the literature by utilizing a variety of network measures of integration. The analyses showed that, consistent with previous findings in the adult studies, higher levels of integration were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, although the association was very weak. Number of friends, the simplest and most frequently used measure of integration in mental health research, had a stronger and more consistent effect than other variables which measured more complex aspects of egocentric and school-level network structure. The results also showed that the relationship between having more friends and fewer depressive symptoms was largely mediated by a sense of belonging, which provided support for the often assumed but rarely tested argument that social integration promotes mental health by inducing positive feelings about one’s relationships with others in society.}}

In the light of the development of strategies for reconstruction of the ocular surface in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency, a major challenge in corneal \{SC\} biology remains the ability to identify stem cells in situ and in vitro. Until recently, the identification of limbal stem cells mainly has been based on general properties of stem cells, e.g. lack of differentiation, prolonged label-retaining, indefinite capacity of proliferation exemplified by the clonogenic assay as well as their special role in corneal wound healing. During the last years, a number of molecular markers for the limbal \{SC\} compartment has been proposed, however, their role in distinguishing limbal \{SC\} from their early progeny is still under debate. Data reported from the literature combined with our own recent observations suggest, that the basal epithelial cells of the human limbus contain ABCG2, K19, vimentin, KGF-R, metallothionein, and integrin α9, but do not stain for K3/K12, Cx43, involucrin, P-cadherin, integrins α2, α6, and β4, and nestin, when compared to the basal cells of the corneal epithelium. A relatively higher expression level in basal limbal cells was observed for p63, α-enolase, K5/14, and HGF-R, whereas there were no significant differences in staining intensity for β-catenin, integrins αv, β1, β2, and β5, CD71, EGF-R, TGF-β-RI, TGF-β-RII, and TrkA between limbal and corneal basal epithelial cells. Therefore, a combination of differentiation-associated markers (e.g. K3/K12, Cx43, or involucrin) and putative SC-associated markers (e.g. ABCG2, K19, vimentin, or integrin α9) may provide a suitable tool for identification of human limbal SC. While most putative \{SC\} markers label the majority of limbal basal cells and, therefore, may not distinguish \{SC\} from progenitor cells, only \{ABCG2\} was strictly confined to small clusters of basal cells in the limbal epithelium. At present, \{ABCG2\} therefore appears to be the most useful cell surface marker for the identification and isolation of corneal epithelial SC. Moreover, the characteristics of the specific microenvironment of corneal SC, as provided by growth factor activity and basement membrane heterogeneity in the limbal area, could serve as additional tools for their selective enrichment and in vitro expansion for the purpose of ocular surface reconstruction.}}

These characteristics are a tax haven connection, high ratios of revenues to pre-tax profits (in some cases greater than 100%), high intra-group borrowing or lending, large gross assets (in excess of €500 million) and low or zero employment. While these firms pay corporation tax in Ireland (at reduced rates), there is considerable loss to other exchequers.

In this paper, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers); the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Logistic regression as well as feedforward error backpropagation artificial neural networks (FEBANN) and wavelet neural networks (WNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of \{EEG\} signals. In these methods we used \{FFT\} and autoregressive (AR) model by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of \{EEG\} signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or nonepileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying \{AR\} with \{MLE\} in connection with WNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The network is constructed by the error backpropagation neural network using Morlet mother wavelet basic function as node activation function. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The WNN-based classifier outperformed the \{FEBANN\} and logistic regression based counterpart. Within the same group, the WNN-based classifier was more accurate than the FEBANN-based classifier, and the logistic regression-based classifier.}}

Structure-based modeling methods are used to examine the excitation transfer kinetics of the plant PSI-LHCI supercomplex. For this purpose an effective Hamiltonian is constructed that combines an existing cyanobacterial model for structurally conserved chlorophylls with spectral information for chlorophylls in the Lhca subunits. The plant \{PSI\} excitation migration network thus characterized is compared to its cyanobacterial counterpart investigated earlier. In agreement with observations, an average excitation transfer lifetime of ∼49 ps is computed for the plant PSI-LHCI supercomplex with a corresponding quantum yield of 95%. The sensitivity of the results to chlorophyll site energy assignments is discussed. Lhca subunits are efficiently coupled to the \{PSI\} core via gap chlorophylls. In contrast to the chlorophylls in the vicinity of the reaction center, previously shown to optimize the quantum yield of the excitation transfer process, the orientational ordering of peripheral chlorophylls does not show such optimality. The finding suggests that after close packing of chlorophylls was achieved, constraints other than efficiency of the overall excitation transfer process precluded further evolution of pigment ordering.}}

For example, we show that very short synthesis and decay times can perturb the wild-type pattern. On the other hand, separation of time-scales between pre- and post-translational processes and a minimal prepattern ensure convergence to the wild-type expression pattern regardless of fluctuations.}}

abstract = {The C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) phosphorylates and down-regulates Src family tyrosine kinases. The Csk-binding protein (Cbp) localizes Csk close to its substrates at the plasma membrane, and increases the specific activity of the kinase. To investigate this long-range catalytic effect, the phosphorylation of Src and the conformation of Csk were investigated in the presence of a high-affinity phosphopeptide derived from Cbp. This peptide binds tightly to the \{SH2\} domain and enhances Src recognition (lowers Km) by increasing the apparent phosphoryl transfer rate in the Csk active site, a phenomenon detected in rapid quench flow experiments. Previous studies demonstrated that the regulation of Csk activity is linked to conformational changes in the enzyme that can be probed with hydrogen–deuterium exchange methods. We show that the Cbp peptide impacts deuterium incorporation into its binding partner (the \{SH2\} domain), and into the SH2-kinase linker and several sequences in the kinase domain, including the glycine-rich loop in the active site. These findings, along with computational data from normal mode analyses, suggest that the \{SH2\} domain moves in a cantilever fashion with respect to the small lobe of the kinase domain, ordering the active site for catalysis. The binding of a small Cbp-derived peptide to the \{SH2\} domain of Csk modifies these motions, enhancing Src recognition.}}

Such an assembly requires at least two kinds of protein–protein interfaces. The first is involved in “cis” dimerization, and consists of transposase molecules bound side-by-side on a single \{DNA\} molecule. The second, which is involved in “trans” dimerization, consists of transposase molecules bound to two different \{DNA\} molecules. Here, we used biochemical and genetic methods to enhance the definition of the regions involved in cis and trans-dimerization in the mariner Mos1 transposase. The cis and trans-dimerization interfaces were both found within the first 143 amino acid residues of the protein. The cis-dimerization activity was mainly contained in amino acids 1–20. The region spanning from amino acid residues 116–143, and containing the \{WVPHEL\} motif, was involved in the cis- to trans-shift as well as in trans-dimerization stabilization. Although the transposase exists mainly as a monomer in solution, we provide evidence that the transposase cis-dimer is the active species in inverted terminal repeat (ITR) binding. We also observed that the catalytic domain of the mariner Mos1 transposase modulates efficient transposase–transposase interactions in the absence of the transposon ends.}}

They Sr isotope ratio analyses were accompanied by measurements of stream discharge, rainfall, stable O isotope ratios and major ion and 3H concentrations. The average Sr ion concentration and 87Sr/86Sr ratio for the terminal stream basin (the Middle Oconee River) were 23.6 μg/L and 0.7172, respectively. The average 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the rainwater and shallow ground water were below 0.7125, indicating that most of the Sr in this stream water is input by weathering reactions in deeper ground water, rather than by ion exchange in shallow soil horizons. This is consistent with the higher alkalinity concentrations (∼23–47 mg/L) and specific conductance values (60–113 μS/cm) that characterize stream base flow. Piedmont streams are characterized by lower concentrations of Sr and higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios than average global stream flow. Base flow rates decreased by a factor of 2–3 during the summer months and this is accompanied by increased alkalinity concentrations. 87Sr/86Sr ratios, however, were temporally invariant for a given stream basin and were independent of season, antecedent rainfall, and discharge. 87Sr/86Sr ratios were unique for each of the 4 basins and a general trend toward higher ratios with increasing basin area was apparent. The inferred contribution from minerals with high Rb contents such as K feldspar and muscovite may have resulted from the greater integration of flow from mineralogically diverse pathways afforded by a larger basin area. The basin specificity and temporal or seasonal invariability make 87Sr/86Sr ratios an invaluable hydrological tracer that can be readily employed in mass balance studies of stream flow within the Piedmont Province.}}

This article examines this paradox and identifies how firms manage the dual process of adapting within relationships, and to a changing external environment. Findings are based on 24 case studies of New Zealand wineries, supplemented by 20 network interviews. Relationships were used by the firms to adapt to the marketplace, and firms that formed deeper relationships placed themselves in a better competitive position vis-à-vis those that didn't, if they fit their relationship strategy to the demands of the environment. To avoid inertia firms needed to complement strong relational ties with weak market-based ties to gain insight into emerging trends. This informed decisions regarding further relational commitments, and helped strengthen their position within established networks.}}

Expression of COX-2 protein was higher in RIE-RhoA(63L) (four-fold), RIE-Ras(12V) (seven-fold) cells than in parental cells. Prior work suggests that Ras hyperactivity induces the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) β, increases epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptide signaling-possible mechanisms for increased COX-2 expression. Expression of COX-2 was stimulated by TGFβ, TGFα in RIE, RIE-Rho(63L) cells, but not further stimulated in RIE-Ras(12V) cells. PD153035, an inhibitor of \{EGF\} receptor tyrosine kinase, PD98059, an inhibitor of Erk, attenuated COX-2 expression in RIE, RIE-RhoA(63L). However, the high levels of COX-2 expression in RIE-Ras(12V) cells were not inhibited by either compound. Titration with a panneutralizing anti-TGFβ antibody did not decrease COX-2 in RIE-Ras(12V) cells, even with concurrent \{EGFR\} inhibition. Thus, stimulation of the \{EGF\} receptor is important in the modulation of COX-2 expression in nontransformed RIE, RIE-RhoA(63L) cells. In Rastransformed cells, signaling by additional Ras effector pathways, perhaps the RhoA pathway, must be invoked. Identification of these pathways is critical for therapeutic manipulation of COX-2 expression.}}

abstract = {Summary The archetypal human tumor suppressor p53 is considered to have unique transactivation properties. The assumption is based on the fact that additionally identified human p53 isoforms lack transcriptional activity. However, we provide evidence for the existence of an alternatively spliced p53 isoform (Δp53) that exerts its transcriptional activity independent from p53. In contrast to p53, Δp53 transactivates the endogenous p21 and 14-3-3σ but not the mdm2, bax, and \{PIG3\} promoter. Cell cycle studies showed that Δp53 displays its differential transcriptional activity only in damaged S phase cells. Upon activation of the ATR-intra-S phase checkpoint, Δp53, but not p53, transactivates the Cdk inhibitor p21. Induction of p21 results in downregulation of cyclin A-Cdk activity and accordingly attenuation of S phase progression. Data demonstrate that the Δp53-p21-cyclin A-Cdk pathway is crucial to facilitate uncoupling of repair and replication events, indicating that Δp53 is an essential element of the ATR-intra-S phase checkpoint.}}

The distribution of groundwater ages within these heterogeneous systems will be related to the groundwater velocity within the fractures, but also to the size of the fractures and the geometry of the fracture network, and to the hydraulic properties of the aquifer matrix. In this paper, we present analytical and numerical simulations of environmental tracer concentrations in fractured rock aquifers to examine the effect of changes in aquifer parameters on the tracer distributions. In particular, we show that where horizontal fractures are strongly vertically connected, then it may be reasonable to use one-dimensional models of flow and transport through vertical fractures to represent flow through aquifers containing both horizontal and vertical fractures. The presence of large numbers of horizontal fractures will not cause flow to depart significantly from the one-dimensional approximation. Where a smaller number of horizontal fractures are present, then abrupt decreases in the vertical water velocity can occur, as water is intercepted and diverted laterally. Measurements of 14C, 3H, 36Cl, and chlorofluorocarbons within nested piezometers from the Clare Valley, South Australia, display a number of the features apparent in the generic simulations. The use of a number of different tracers appears to allow some fracture and matrix parameters to be constrained more tightly than might previously have been thought possible.}}

The effect of the specimen size, stacking sequence and material system on the failure load was determined experimentally and the failure modes examined through fractographic analysis. Damage was found to initiate at low load levels, typically 20–30% of the failure load. The dominant initial failure mode was matrix intralaminar shear failure which occurred in sub-surface plies. The damage developed into a network of intralaminar and interlaminar shear cracks. Two different macromechanical failure modes were identified, fastener pull-through failure and global collapse of the laminate. The internal damage and ultimate failure mode were found to depend upon the laminate stacking sequence and resin system. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed to analyse the stress distribution within the laminate and predict first-ply failure. The results from the finite element model were found to be in general agreement with the experimental observations.}}

Advocates of industrial ecology suggest that by shifting the basis of industrial production from a linear to a closed loop system, these gains can be achieved. In recent years, concepts drawn from industrial ecology have been used to plan and develop eco-industrial parks (EIPs) that seek to increase business competitiveness, reduce waste and pollution, create jobs and improve working conditions. Despite a growing interest in EIPs, there have been few empirically informed studies that seek to explore the potential contribution such \{EIPs\} may make to sustainable development. This paper contributes to a developing sympathetic critique of industrial ecology by focusing on the key problems and dilemmas that arise in the course of developing eco-industrial parks, drawing upon empirical work conducted in the USA. The paper draws upon both an extensive survey of \{EIPs\} and in-depth interviews conducted with a range of stakeholders at ten \{US\} sites. As the paper reveals, \{EIPs\} in the \{USA\} are in their early stages and likewise their contribution to both economic development and environmental policy, let alone social policies, is complicated and inchoate. The empirical material reveals that key features of industrial ecology such as inter-firm networking and collaboration in the form of materials interchange and energy cascading are either absent or in the early planning stages. In each of the ten cases what is emerging is a form of \{EIP\} partly determined by the geographic setting and broader economic realities of the locality. While collaborative behaviour between firms is central to \{EIP\} development if the potential benefits of industrial ecology are to be realised, it is important to realise that such behaviour is difficult to develop from scratch through policy intervention. In conclusion, the paper suggests that expectations must be realistic for the community and location in question. As part of that realism, \{EIP\} projects must be designed to allow for a gradual approach, and each phase needs to be financially viable.}}

Although the hidden node problem is well known, so far only few papers have quantified its effects in a comprehensive manner.

We first carry out an exact queuing-theoretic analysis for a 4-node segment and derive analytical expressions for the probability of packet collision, the mean packet delay, and the maximum throughput, based on a model that closely follows the \{IEEE\} 802.11 standard. We then extend the analysis and provide an approximation for a general linear topology that is asymptotically exact at low load. Finally, we perform detailed simulations to validate our analytical results and show their applicability to predict the performance of \{IEEE\} 802.11 networks with hidden nodes. The simulation and analysis closely match. Moreover, they reveal that the impact of hidden nodes propagates through the network causing some nodes to saturate at load as low as 15% of the capacity.}}

abstract = {Hydrothermal systems and related vents can exhibit dramatic changes in their physico-chemical conditions over time as a response to varying activity in the feeding magmatic systems. Massive steam condensation and gas scrubbing processes of thermal fluids during their ascent and cooling cause further compositional changes that mask information regarding the conditions evolving at depth in the hydrothermal system. Here we propose a new stability diagram based on the CO2-CH4-CO-H2 concentrations in vapor, which aims at calculating the temperatures and pressures in hydrothermal reservoirs. To filter gas scrubbing effects, we have also developed a model for selective dissolution of CO2-H2S-N2-CH4-He-Ne mixtures in fresh and/or air-saturated seawater. This methodology has been applied to the recent (November 2002) crisis that affected the geothermal field off the island of Panarea (Italy), where the fluid composition and fluxes have been monitored for the past two decades. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the gases suggest that the volatile elements originate from an active magma, which feeds a boiling saline solution having temperatures of up to 350°C and containing ≈12 mol% \{CO2\} in vapor. The thermal fluids undergo cooling and re-equilibration processes on account of gas-water-rock interactions during their ascent along fracture networks. Furthermore, steam condensation and removal of acidic species, partial dissolution in cold air-saturated seawater and stripping of atmospheric components, affect the composition of the geothermal gases at shallow levels. The observed geochemical variations are consistent with a new input of magmatic fluids that perturbed the geothermal system and caused the unrest event. The present-state evolution shows that this dramatic input of fluids is probably over, and that the system is now tending towards steady-state conditions on a time scale of months.}}

In this paper, we consider two fundamental problems on dynamic lightpath protection in \{WDM\} mesh networks. In the first problem, we consider a network without wavelength converters; thus both the working lightpath and protection lightpath are subject to the wavelength continuity constraint. Existing polynomial time algorithms can be applied to find a pair of link-disjoint lightpaths on a single wavelength; however, such algorithms fail if the working and protection lightpaths are on two different wavelengths. In the second problem, we consider a network with full wavelength conversion; thus the wavelength continuity constraint does not apply. Yet a single factor can cause multiple fiber links to fail simultaneously. The problem becomes finding link-disjoint lightpaths that are also risk disjoint. We prove that both of the two problems are NP-complete. We develop \{ILP\} formulations and heuristic algorithms for the two NP-complete problems. Practical constraints such as service level agreement (SLA) and priority are also considered. Computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the heuristic algorithms.}}

Complementary offline rating and keypress experiments determined an aversive rank ordering of angry, fearful, neutral, and happy faces and revealed behavioral sensitization to the angry faces. Subjects rated angry faces, in contrast to other face categories such as fear, as significantly more likely to directly inflict harm. Furthermore, they rated angry faces as significantly less likely to produce positive emotional outcomes than the other face categories.

First hits (hypoxia, hypotension, organ and soft tissue injuries, fractures), as well as second hits (e.g. ischaemia/reperfusion injuries, compartment syndromes, operative interventions, infections), induce a host defence response. This is characterized by local and systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, proteins of the contact phase and coagulation systems, complement factors and acute phase proteins, as well as hormonal mediators: it is defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), according to clinical parameters. However, in parallel, anti-inflammatory mediators are produced (compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). An imbalance of these dual immune responses seems to be responsible for organ dysfunction and increased susceptibility to infections. Endothelial cell damage, accumulation of leukocytes, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and microcirculatory disturbances lead finally to apoptosis and necrosis of parenchymal cells, with the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or multiple organ failure (MOF). Whereas most clinical trials with anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant, or antioxidant strategies failed, the implementation of pre- and in-hospital trauma protocols and the principle of damage control procedures have reduced post-traumatic complications. However, the development of immunomonitoring will help in the selection of patients at risk of post-traumatic complications and, thereby, the choice of the most appropriate treatment protocols for severely injured patients.}}

abstract = {Understanding of the calcified composite eyes of trilobites, the oldest preserved visual system, has advanced greatly in recent decades. Three types of trilobite eye occur, the more derived abathochroal and schizochroal types having evolved neotenically from holochroal eyes. Comparative morphology and phylogenetic considerations suggest that all three eye-types were underlain by common developmental systems. So far, understanding of these systems has been based entirely on morphological data from fossils, particularly the way the visual surface grew and the patterning of lens emplacement. Lenses characteristically form a hexagonal array comprising horizontal rows and, conspicuously in schizochroal eyes, dorso-ventral files. Because individual trilobites sometimes have eyes with different numbers of files, file number must reflect the operation of a developmental programme rather than being under immediate genetic control. An empirical developmental model has been devised to describe trilobite eye development, with separate rules dealing with the initiation of lens emplacement, growth and differentiation of the visual surface, and the termination of lens emplacement. Rarely, trilobites may have visual surfaces of normal size, but which lack lenses. This confirms that visual surface growth must have been regulated separately from lens emplacement, and is a feature that cannot be accounted for by the existing developmental model. Such a developmental separation is one of a number of similarities shared with Drosophila, the modern arthropod in which eye development is best understood. Many aspects of eye development are conserved in the Euarthropoda, and in bilaterian metazoans in general. A revised model for trilobite eye development is proposed using extant phylogenetic bracketing, interpreting morphological data from the fossils in the context of the hierarchy of developmental controls now becoming known from living animals. This new model suggests that overall eye shape and size did not require differential growth of the generative zone, as previously thought, and that no separate instruction was needed to specify the termination of lens emplacement. Instead, these features were regulated directly, by controlling the proliferation of cells making up the nascent visual surface. A process documented from Drosophila, which involves the selective inhibition of cells in front of a wave-like front of differentiation, and that is regulated by widely conserved genes, can be used to explain how the trilobite visual surface became differentiated. The model implies also that changes in hormonally regulated developmental pathways known from recent arthropods may have been responsible for the development of abathochroal and schizochroal eyes, and for heterochronic secondary eye reduction and blindness in trilobites.}}

They are very well preserved, because the region was abandoned in the 10th century \{AD\} and no significant resettlement took place. Earthquakes, diseases and political reasons are in general thought to be responsible for this development. However, rain-fed agriculture was the economic basis of the Decapolis cities, and only a surplus in production made their wealth possible. Thus environmental change, caused by mismanagement or climate change, could have been responsible for the abandonment of the area. Historical land use reconstruction and soil analysis are well-suited to prove environmental changes. Mismanagement should have left erosion on the plateau and colluvial substrates in the valleys, while a change of climate should be detectable in a differentiated soil genesis and indirectly by assessment of agricultural productivity of land use change. The analysis of the land use pattern and the study of soils at the Decapolis city of Abila indicate that a climate change had great influence in the abandonment of the site. In this context land use, soil development and local climate are important interrelated site factors.}}

To make a decision, the primate brain coordinates dynamic interactions between several cortical and subcortical areas that process sensory, cognitive, and reward information. In selecting the optimal behavioral response, decision mechanisms integrate the accumulating evidence with reward expectation and knowledge from prior experience, and deliberate about the choice that matches the expected outcome. Linkages between sensory input and behavioral output responsible for response selection are shown in the neural activity of structures from the prefrontal-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. The deliberation process can be best described in terms of sensitivity, selection bias, and activation threshold. Here, we show a systems neuroscience approach of the visual saccade decision circuit and the interaction between its components during decision formation.}}

Two methods of buffer space allocation at the switches, and two congestion control mechanisms are modeled. The proposed algorithms have been extensively tested against simulation values. The results show that the proposed framework yields robust, reliable and accurate estimates of network performance measures, such as throughput, number of packets in the system, and switch and link utilization. The computation time required is minimal. The unified framework presents a useful set of tools for telecommunication network designers in evaluating numerous network designs.}}

The conversion of the triple-unsaturated β -ionone up to complete hydrogenation proceeds via a network of three parallel and four consecutive reactions. The kinetic parameters were determined, including the influence of external and particularly internal diffusion. Furthermore, the applicability of the presaturated one-liquid flow (POLF) reactor was studied. In this steady-state system, the liquid is externally presaturated with hydrogen, and then fed into a fixed-bed reactor. This leads to a simple – e.g. with respect to scale-up – two-phase system (liquid and solid catalyst) compared to common three-phase batch reactors (and also to “steady-state alternatives” like a trickle bed). For the given reaction, a liquid recycle is installed to compensate the low hydrogen-solubility.

abstract = {Base excision repair (BER) averts the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of most endogenously produced \{DNA\} damage, including lesions that arise spontaneously due to the intrinsic instability of \{DNA\} or modifications that are formed from reactions with intracellular chemicals, such as reactive oxygen species and alkylating agents. Defects in the \{BER\} process have been associated with cancer susceptibility and neurodegenerative disorders. In its most simplistic form, \{BER\} can be fully reconstituted with a minimum of four human proteins and is completed in just five sequential steps: (i) excision of an inappropriate base by a \{DNA\} glycosylase (e.g., uracil \{DNA\} glycosylase); (ii) incision of the \{DNA\} backbone immediately adjacent to the resulting abasic site by apurinic/apyrimidimic endonuclease 1; (iii) removal of the 5′-abasic terminal fragment, and (iv) repair synthesis to fill the gap by \{DNA\} polymerase β; and (v) ligation to seal the remaining nick by \{DNA\} ligase 1 or a complex of \{DNA\} ligase 3 and X-ray repair cross-complementing 1. However, \{BER\} can involve the participation of other proteins as well, such as alternative \{DNA\} polymerases or one of several nonessential “auxiliary” factors. In addition, \{BER\} operates most efficiently when specific protein–protein coordination occurs. Furthermore, several \{BER\} protein activities have been shown to be regulated by posttranslational modification, and some of the physical protein interactions link \{BER\} to other \{DNA\} transaction pathways. In this review, we summarize the current state of the emerging complexities of mammalian BER, focusing on the growing number of reported protein–protein interactions and posttranslational modifications.}}

abstract = {As the use of gene knockout models in thermoregulation studies has gained popularity, the reported incidence of redundant or discrepant phenotypes between studies has also increased. Several gene knockout models mimic human processes and have provided valuable insight into the role of endogenous mediators in thermoregulatory processes. There are also many examples of mutant strains expressing virtually identical phenotypes as their wild-type controls, causing concern regarding the appropriateness of these models for the study of physiological processes. In some cases, discrepancies in results are being reported from different laboratories that are studying the same gene knockout model. While mutant strains provide a powerful tool for analysis of gene function in vivo, the breeding strategies used to generate the strain may have a profound impact on the expressed phenotype. This review examines the intricacies of working with a small rodent such as the mouse and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using gene knockout models for thermoregulatory research. A number of experimental strategies that can be used to minimize the occurrence of redundant phenotypes are presented. The influence of background strain effects is also considered, since this may be one of the most important factors influencing a mutant phenotype. A future perspective is provided in which more advanced technologies using conditional gene inactivation and the production of rat knockout strains will improve current experimental design.}}

abstract = {Ischemic proliferative retinopathy develops in various retinal disorders, including retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. Ischemic retinopathy remains a common cause of visual impairment and blindness in the industrialized world due to relatively ineffective treatment. Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is an established model of retinopathy of prematurity associated with vascular cell injury culminating in microvascular degeneration, which precedes an abnormal neovascularization. The retina is a tissue particularly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the ischemic retina becomes highly sensitive to lipid peroxidation initiated by oxygenated free radicals. Consequently, the retina constitutes an excellent model for testing the functional consequences of membrane lipid peroxidation. Retinal tissue responds to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli by the activation of phospholipases and the consequent release from membrane phospholipids of biologically active metabolites. Activation of phospholipase \{A2\} is the first step in the synthesis of two important classes of lipid second messengers, the eicosanoids and a membrane-derived phospholipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF). These lipid mediators accumulate in the retina in response to injury and a physiologic role of these metabolites in retinal vasculature remains for the most part to be determined; albeit proposed roles have been suggested for some. The eicosanoids, in particular the prostanoids, thromboxane (TXA2) and \{PAF\} are abundantly generated following an oxidant stress and contribute to neurovascular injury. \{TXA2\} and \{PAF\} play an important role in the retinal microvacular degeneration of \{OIR\} by directly inducing endothelial cell death and potentially could contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathies. Despite these advances there are still a number of important questions that remain to be answered before we can confidently target pathological signals. This review focuses on mechanisms that precede the development of neovascularization, most notably regarding the role of lipid mediators that partake in microvascular degeneration.}}

As this area derives most of its concepts and methods from social network analysis more generally, the present discussion has wider relevance. One problem is that some Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have assumed that if a participant (who gave informed consent) is to be asked to name network associates these too — automatically — would be human subjects from whom informed consent also must be obtained. Invariably, if this occurs proposed research — whatever its funding and potential contributions might be — is blocked. A conservative approach is taken here. The Common Rule is assumed to provide relevant guidance, the responsibility of \{IRBs\} is to make decisions based on the Common Rule, and in consequence the burden is on those proposing social network research to design — and defend — their planned work with this in mind. At the same time, it is argued that it is important not to stifle beneficial research by adding to one inherently conservative review process (of grant proposals) another (of IRBs) so that work is prevented simply because it is research at the frontiers rather than ‘safe’ research.}}

The electrical double-layer characteristics of the solid/liquid interface were studied in the absence and presence of adsorbed layers of high molecular weight polyacrylic acids (PAA; Carbopol). Since the Carbopol-covered particles can be thought of as “soft” colloids, Ohshima's theory was used to gain information of the surface potential and the charge density of the polymer layer. The effect of the pH of the solution on the double-layer characteristics is related to the different conformations of the adsorbed molecules provoked by the dissociation of the acrylic groups present in polymer molecules. The stability of the suspensions was experimentally studied for different pH and polymer concentrations, and in the absence or presence of a weak magnetic field applied. The stability of the suspensions was explained using the classical \{DLVO\} theory of colloidal stability extended to account for hydration, steric, and magnetic interactions between particles. Diagrams of potential energy vs interparticle distance show the predominant effect of steric, hydrophilic/hydrophobic, and magnetic interactions on the whole stability of the system. The best conditions to obtain stable suspensions were found when strong steric and hydrophilic repulsions hinder the coagulation between polymer-covered particles, simultaneously avoiding sedimentation by the thickening effect of the polymer solution. When a not too high molecular weight \{PAA\} was employed in a low concentration, the task of a long-time antisettling effect compatible with the desired magnetic response of the fluid was achieved.}}

The scheduling of pipeless plants adds new challenges to the scheduling of conventional batch plants. This is because of the requirement to consider the allocation of resources and also the plant layout so that vessels can move from one processing station to another without conflict. This research investigates the integrated problem of scheduling and routing in pipeless plants and develops a constraint-based methodology suitable for different layouts. During the scheduling process, besides time and resource allocation, a planner is also called to find possible routes to move vessels from one processing station to the next proposed station. Each of the dynamically generated routes is immediately checked for feasible track allocation so that any infeasible route is discarded as soon as possible to save computational time. A typical scheduling problem and results are described in detail to show how this integrated approach works.}}

In this paper, we propose two new neural network structures that overcome the curse of dimensionality and the complexities in temporal pattern recognition. The one-variable-one-network (OVON) architecture decomposes the problem in the variable dimension—univariate temporal patterns, called sub-states, are first identified in each variable; subsequently, the process state is inferred using the variable sub-states. The one-class-one-network (OCON) architecture uses a problem decomposition in the class dimension—the presence of specific temporal patterns in a high-dimensional space is first established using a bank of two-class classifiers. The process state is then identified by aggregating the results of the different classifiers. Both the architectures use a set of neural networks—in \{OVON\} there is one network for each variable, while in OCON, one network is used for each pattern class to be identified. In comparison to traditional monolithic neural networks, both the proposed architectures improve classification accuracy and minimize the training complexity. In addition, \{OVON\} is robust to sensor failures and \{OCON\} is well suited for addition of new pattern classes. The structures and training methodologies of the two architectures are presented and their performance compared against traditional neural networks using patterns arising during transitions in a simulated fluidized catalytic cracking unit.}}

abstract = {The chemical composition and evolution of produced waters associated with gas production in the Palm Valley gas field, Northern Territory, has important implications for issues such as gas reserve calculations, reservoir management and saline water disposal. The occurrence of saline formation water in the Palm Valley field has been the subject of considerable debate. There were no occurrences of mobile water early in the development of the field and only after gas production had reduced the reservoir pressure, was saline formation water produced. Initially this was in small quantities but has increased dramatically with time, particularly after the initiation of compression in November 1996. The produced waters range from highly saline (up to 300,000 mg/L TDS), with unusual enrichments in Ca, Ba and Sr, to low salinity fluids that may represent condensate waters. The Sr isotopic compositions of the waters (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7041–0.7172) are also variable but do not correlate closely with major and trace element abundances. Although the extreme salinity suggests possible involvement of evaporite deposits lower in the stratigraphic sequence, the Sr isotopic composition of the high salinity waters suggests a more complex evolutionary history. The formation waters are chemically and isotopically heterogeneous and are not well mixed. The high salinity brines have Sr isotopic compositions and other geochemical characteristics more consistent with long-term residence within the reservoir rocks than with present-day derivation from a more distal pool of brines associated with evaporites. If the high salinity brines entered the reservoir during the Devonian uplift and were displaced by the reservoir gas into a stagnant pool, which has remained near the reservoir for the last 300–400 Ma, then the size of the brine pool is limited. At a minimum, it might be equivalent to the volume displaced by the reservoired gas.}}

The importance of the proper spatial and temporal regulation of \{FGF\} signals is evident from human and mouse genetic studies which show that mutations leading to the dysregulation of \{FGF\} signals cause a variety of developmental disorders including dominant skeletal diseases and cancer. The \{FGF\} ligands signal via a family of receptor tyrosine kinases and, depending on the cell type or stage of maturation, produce diverse biological responses that include proliferation, growth arrest, differentiation or apoptosis. A central issue in \{FGF\} biology is to understand how these diverse cellular responses are determined and how similar signaling inputs can generate distinct patterns of gene expression that govern the specificity of the cellular response. In this review we draw upon studies from the past fifteen years and attempt to construct a molecular picture of the different levels of regulation by which such specific cellular responses could be achieved by \{FGF\} signals. We discuss whether specificity could lie in the nature of the ligand, the particular receptor, the signal transduction pathways utilized, or the transcriptional regulation of specific genes. Finally, we also discuss how the interplay of \{FGF\} signals with other signaling systems could contribute to the cellular response. In particular we focus on the interaction with the Wnt pathway since FGF/Wnt cross-talk is emerging as an important nexus in regulating a variety of biological processes.}}

A second group of subjects (n=17) silently counted the ‘novel’ environmental sounds, the ‘infrequent’ tones now serving as the task-irrelevant deviant events. Analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from 63 scalp channels suggested a spatiotemporal overlap of fronto-central novelty \{P3\} and centro-parietal \{P3\} (P3b) \{ERP\} features in both groups. Application of independent component analysis (ICA) to concatenated single trials revealed two independent component clusters that accounted for portions of the novelty \{P3\} and \{P3b\} response features, respectively. The P3b-related \{ICA\} cluster contributed to the novelty \{P3\} amplitude response to novel environmental sounds. In contrast to the scalp ERPs, the amplitude of the novelty \{P3\} related cluster was not affected by voluntary attention, that is, by the target/nontarget distinction. This result demonstrates the usefulness of \{ICA\} for disentangling spatiotemporally overlapping \{ERP\} processes and provides evidence that task irrelevance is not a necessary feature of novelty processing.}}

In this paper we present a tentative four-dimensional framework in terms of surface of integration, scope of integration, time horizon of integration, and intensity of integration. This framework can be used to analyze how network settings are developed, in terms of structural design of the network, the design of the workflow in collaborative settings, and the aspects of handling the psychological and social boundaries between people.}}

abstract = {We introduce a new architecture of hybrid fuzzy polynomial neural networks (HFPNN) that is based on a genetically optimized multi-layer perceptron and develop their comprehensive design methodology involving mechanisms of genetic optimization. The construction of \{HFPNN\} exploits fundamental technologies of computational intelligence (CI), namely fuzzy sets, neural networks, and genetic algorithms (GAs). The architecture of the resulting genetically optimized \{HFPNN\} (namely gHFPNN) results from a synergistic usage of the hybrid system generated by combining fuzzy polynomial neurons (FPNs)-based fuzzy neural networks (FNN) with polynomial neurons (PNs)-based polynomial neural networks (PNN). The design of the conventional \{HFPNN\} exploits the extended group method of data handling (GMDH) with some essential parameters of the network being provided by the designer and kept fixed throughout the overall development process. This restriction may hamper a possibility of producing an optimal architecture of the model. The augmented gHFPNN results in a structurally optimized structure and comes with a higher level of flexibility in comparison to the one we encounter in the conventional HFPNN. The GA-based design procedure being applied at each layer of \{HFPNN\} leads to the selection of preferred nodes (FPNs or PNs) available within the HFPNN. In the sequel, two general optimization mechanisms are explored. First, the structural optimization is realized via \{GAs\} whereas the ensuing detailed parametric optimization is carried out in the setting of a standard least square method-based learning. The performance of the gHFPNN is quantified through experimentation where we exploit data coming from processes of pH neutralization and \{NOx\} emission. These datasets have already been used quite intensively in fuzzy and neurofuzzy modeling. The obtained results demonstrate superiority of the proposed networks over the existing fuzzy and neural models.}}

The network model generated anisotropic void networks of rectangular cross-sectional pores connected by elliptical cross-sectional throats. These structures had porosities and mercury intrusion properties which closely matched those of the experimental samples. The permeation of hexadecane, used as an analogue for the experimental test oil, was then simulated through these void structures. The simulations were compared to measurements of the permeation of mineral oil into four types of paper coating formulation. The simulations showed that the inertia of the fluid as it enters void features causes a considerable change in wetting over a few milliseconds, a timescale relevant to printing in a modern press. They also showed that in the more anisotropic samples, fast advance wetting occurred through narrow void features. It was found that the match between experimental and simulated wetting could be improved by correcting the simulation for the number of surface throats. The simulations showed a more realistic experimental trend, and much greater preferential flow, than the traditional Lucas–Washburn and effective hydraulic radius approaches.}}

By defining the behavior of entire biological pathways and networks under various physiological states, these studies aim to extend traditional reductionist molecular genetic approaches regarding the biological roles of the vast array of uncharacterized gene products. A key goal is to determine how the information encoded by the myriad of expressed gene products is integrated at the molecular, cellular, and even whole organism level to create the dynamic biochemical processes and complex physiological controls that sustain life. While comparison of the complementary information contained in proteomic and mRNA data sets poses considerable analytical challenges, these efforts should provide added insight into the fundamental mechanisms underlying physiology, development, and the emergence of disease. Here, we outline several analytical approaches, methods, and tools that have proven to be helpful in the face of this important challenge.}}

Here we review evidence suggesting altered gene and protein expression in response to such emissions, with particular focus on heat shock proteins. Non-thermal induction of heat shock proteins has been claimed by a number of investigations in in vitro cellular systems, and appears pleiotrophic for many other regulatory events. However, many of these studies are flawed by inconsistencies in exposure models, cell types used and the independent reproducibility of the findings. Further, the paucity of evidence from in vivo experimentation is largely contradictory. Therefore, the validity of these effects in human health risk assessment remain unsubstantiated.

In current N cycle models, a major proportion of global marine denitrification (50–70%) is assumed to take place on the sea floor, particularly in organic rich continental margin sediments. Recent observations indicate that present conceptual views of denitrification and pathways of nitrate reduction and \{N2\} formation are incomplete. Alternative N cycle pathways, particularly in sediments, include anaerobic ammonium oxidation to nitrite, nitrate and \{N2\} by Mn-oxides, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction and subsequent \{N2\} mobilization. The discovery of new links and feedback mechanisms between the redox cycles of, e.g., C, N, S, Mn and Fe casts doubt on the present general understanding of the global N cycle. Recent models of the oceanic N budget indicate that total inputs are significantly smaller than estimated fixed N removal. The occurrence of alternative N reaction pathways further exacerbates the apparent imbalance as they introduce additional routes of N removal. In this contribution, we give a brief historical background of the conceptual understanding of N cycling in marine ecosystems, emphasizing pathways of aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization in marine sediments, and the implications of recently recognized metabolic pathways for N removal in marine environments.}}

Given that proteins are well-structured and can be rapidly synthesized, they are excellent targets for engineering both molecular structure and biological function. Computational analysis of the protein design problem allows scientists to explore sequence space and systematically discover novel protein molecules. Nonetheless, the complexity of proteins, the subtlety of the determinants of folding, and the exponentially large number of possible sequences impede the search for peptide sequences compatible with a desired structure and function. Directed search algorithms, which identify directly a small number of sequences, have achieved some success in identifying sequences with desired structures and functions. Alternatively, one can adopt a probabilistic approach. Instead of a finite number of sequences, such calculations result in a probabilistic description of the sequence ensemble. In particular, by casting the formalism in the language of statistical mechanics, the site-specific amino acid probabilities of sequences compatible with a target structure may be readily estimated. These computed probabilities are well suited for both de novo protein design of particular sequences as well as combinatorial, library-based protein engineering. The computed site-specific amino acid profile may be converted to a nucleotide base distribution to allow assembly of a partially randomized gene library. The ability to synthesize readily such degenerate oligonucleotide sequences according to the prescribed distribution is key to constructing a biased peptide library genuinely reflective of the computational design. Herein we illustrate how a standard \{DNA\} synthesizer can be used with only a slight modification to the synthesis protocol to generate a pool of degenerate \{DNA\} sequences, which encodes a predetermined amino acid distribution with high fidelity.}}

Hierarchical fluxes are directed from the first to the second layer and then towards the drainage layer in order to take into account physiological flow direction. Irritation is modeled by changing compliance of vessels situated at the entrance of the micro-circulation. The model permits to investigate the influence of change in compliance on flow and pressure behavior at microscopic and macroscopic level.}}

In the 1980s the concept of deep integration went beyond trade with its focus on policy harmonization, which came to include monetary integration, but it presupposed trade integration as the first step in the regional integration sequence. When discussion of monetary integration began in East Asia after 1997, it was in the absence of trade integration. The conventional view would see this as an obstacle to greater regional integration, but some proponents of Asian regionalism saw monetary integration as a step towards promoting trade integration, reversing the orthodox sequence. This paper re-evaluates the global cross-country evidence on the relationship between trade integration and monetary union, and applies the results to the prospects for monetary union before trade integration in East Asia, and to the consequences of monetary union for trade integration.}}

The design cycle of a product, be it a medical device, software, or any kind of equipment, is similar in concept, and course. Through a series of steps we obtained information related to medical errors and patient safety. These were then utilized to customize the generic device design cycle in ways that would improve the production of critical care devices. First, we provided individuals with different levels of expertise in the clinical, administrative, and engineering domains of a large hospital setting with hypothetical clinical scenarios, each of which described a medical error event involving health professionals and medical devices. Then, we asked our subjects to “think-aloud” as they read through each scenario. Using a set of questions as probes, we then asked our subjects to identify key errors and attribute them to various players. We recorded and transcribed the responses and conducted a cognitive task analysis of each scenario to identify different entities as “constant,” “partially modifiable,” or “modifiable.” We compared our subjects’ responses to the results of the task analysis and then mapped them to the modifiable entities. Lastly, we coded the relationships of these entities to the errors in medical devices. We propose that the incorporation of these modifiable entities into the device design cycle could improve the device end product for better patient safety management.}}

After examining some revisionist efforts, this paper proposes ‘a public-centered view’ that takes the sites of social interactions as a focal point of analysis considering meanings and representations as ‘emergent properties’ arising through actions in these sites. The case of the formation of Japanese aesthetic culture demonstrates how this public-centered approach provides an epistemological linkage to connect meanings with the historical structural analysis without reducing the one to the other.}}

Mdx mice were treated with 10 mg/kg of CsA for 4 to 8 weeks throughout a period of exercise on treadmill, a protocol that worsens the dystrophic condition. The CsA treatment fully prevented the 60% drop of forelimb strength induced by exercise. A significant amelioration (P &lt; 0.05) was observed in histological profile of CsA-treated gastrocnemius muscle with reductions of nonmuscle area (20%), centronucleated fibers (12%), and degenerating area (50%) compared to untreated exercised mdx mice. Consequently, the percentage of normal fibers increased from 26 to 35% in CsA-treated mice. Decreases in creatine kinase and markers of fibrosis were also observed. By electrophysiological recordings ex vivo, we found that CsA counteracted the decrease in chloride conductance (gCl), a functional index of degeneration in diaphragm and extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers. However, electrophysiology and fura-2 calcium imaging did not show any amelioration of calcium homeostasis in extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers. No significant effect was observed on utrophin levels in diaphragm muscle. Our data show that the CsA treatment significantly normalized many functional, histological, and biochemical endpoints by acting on events that are independent or downstream of calcium homeostasis. The beneficial effect of CsA may involve different targets, reinforcing the usefulness of immunosuppressant drugs in muscular dystrophy.}}

This was subsequently used as the basis on which to compare the merits of three approaches to \{QRA\} modelling in such systems. The original model used a Bayesian Network (BN). The second method was a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, a numerical Bayesian technique which retained a similar network structure but allowed further development, such as the separation of variability and uncertainty. The third method was a more detailed simulation model. The \{BN\} responds immediately to changes, such as entering evidence, because it does not use simulation and can propagate information from any point in the network to all others by Bayesian inference. However, it requires all the variables to be discrete, which introduces errors if continuous variables have to be discretized. These errors can accumulate. The \{MCMC\} approach does not require discrete variables while retaining some of the properties of the \{BN\} model, such as the ability to draw inferences from evidence. Finally, the simulation offers greater flexibility, such as consideration of the individual carcass, but may be more complex to implement as a result and sacrifices the ability to propagate evidence.}}

While kinases are key mediators of signal transduction networks, several of which have been well characterized in T-cell activation, the functional roles of other kinases remain poorly defined. To address this deficiency, we developed a genetic screen to survey the functional roles of kinases in antigen mediated T-cell activation. A retroviral library was constructed that expressed genetic suppressor elements (GSEs) comprised of peptides and antisense nucleotides derived from kinase cDNAs including members of the STE, CAMK, AGC, CMGC, RGC, TK, TKL, Atypical, and Lipid kinase groups. The retroviral library was expressed in Jurkat T-cells and analyzed for their effect on T-cell activation as monitored by \{CD69\} expression. Jurkat cells were activated by antigen presenting cells treated with superantigen, and sorted for a \{CD69\} negative phenotype by flow cytometry. We identified 19 protein kinases that were previously implicated in T-cell signaling processes and 12 kinases that were not previously linked to T-cell activation. To further validate our approach, we characterized the role of the protein kinase \{MAP4K4\} that was identified in the screen. siRNA studies showed a role for \{MAP4K4\} in antigen mediated T-cell responses in Jurkat and primary T-cells. In addition, by analyzing multiple promoter elements using reporter assays, we have shown that \{MAP4K4\} is implicated in the activation of the TNF-α promoter. Our results suggest that this methodology could be used to survey the function of the entire kinome in T-cell activation.}}

In this context the definition of the vocabulary and the rules of a design grammar and their relation to the syntax and the semantic of a satellite are presented. Particular sections of the design grammar are discussed and the implemented solutions are explained. The transfer of common design procedures to a rule-based design process is explained. The resulting satellite design process is exemplified through the conceptual design of a small satellite. The applied method is analysed in respect to the required automation of the design process. Its advantages and disadvantages are discussed and compared to the current situation in satellite design.}}

Two cases of the development of these regimes in the environmentally-related areas of forest and fisheries management are examined in Europe and North America, focusing on the Canadian experience in the latter case. The findings reveal significant similarities across sectors and countries but little evidence of any larger pattern of policy convergence. While the impetus for the adoption of both these \{NRNGAs\} lies in the international and regional realms, without the force of either international law or competitive advantage, consequential pressure for convergence is weak. It is proposed that the reasons for the differences in \{NGA\} adoptions thus lie primarily in the interaction of the changing capacities of domestic public and private actors active in the affected resource policy arena: specifically, the interplay between the effect of the internationalisation of resource policy issues, tending to increase private capacities at the expense of the public one, and the declining importance of primary industries, which has the reverse effect.}}

abstract = {Abstract: Vasopressin and oxytocin are neuroendocrine peptide hormones that are synthesised in the hypothalamus and released into the peripheral circulation and into the brain in response to stress, and they regulate stress responses and anxiety behaviours. Stress responses comprise corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) secretion at the median eminence that drives peripheral adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion from the anterior pituitary and consequently glucocorticoid secretion from the adrenal cortex. Vasopressin is a key co-secretagogue for ACTH, synergizing with CRF, and vasopressin synthesis in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and secretion at the median eminence are increased during stress and further enhanced with chronic stress: it has an important role in maintaining stress responsiveness. Centrally, vasopressin inhibits secretory stress responses and increases anxiety. Oxytocin may play a minor role as a secretagogue for \{ACTH\} but has more defined roles within the brain, inhibiting both stress-induced \{ACTH\} secretion and anxiety. Peripheral oxytocin secretion also increases with stress in some species. Vasopressin and oxytocin mechanisms both respond to glucocorticoid feedback and adapt with ageing and through reproduction (pregnancy, parturition and lactation): their contribution to stress responsiveness in such physiological conditions is discussed.}}

Many couples have benefited from this treatment; however, many have also been left frustrated following multiple failed attempts. Couples who fail to conceive after multiple IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatments often seek treatment options that are new and that have not been offered before. Some of these include immunological testing and treatment, allogenic lymphocyte therapy, intratubal transfer of zygotes and embryos, blastocyst transfer, sequential embryo transfer, assisted hatching, co-cultures, and preimplantation genetic screening for aneuploidy. Although the evidence behind some of these is more robust, most suffer from lack of well designed randomized trials comparing them with other treatment options. Randomized studies are extremely difficult to conduct, as couples will resist being randomized into a treatment group where previously failed procedures will be repeated. In the mean time, assisted reproduction programmes should resist offering treatment options that are not evidence based, or at least they should share with the couple the information that is available and should stress that none of these is a panacea for their problem.}}

Both chemical determinants within \{ECM\} molecules and mechanical properties of the \{ECM\} network regulate cellular response, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Type I collagen is the most abundant \{ECM\} protein in the body with a complex structure that can be altered in vivo by proteolysis, cross‐linking, and other processes. Because of collagen's complex and dynamic nature, it is important to define the changes in cell response to different collagen structures and its underlying mechanisms. This chapter reviews current knowledge of potential mechanisms by which type I collagen affects cell behavior, and it presents data that elucidate specific intracellular signaling pathways by which changes in type I collagen structure differentially regulate hepatocyte cell cycle progression and differentiation. A network of polymerized fibrillar type I collagen (collagen gel) induces a highly differentiated but growth‐arrested phenotype in primary hepatocytes, whereas a film of monomeric collagen adsorbed to a rigid dish promotes cell cycle progression and dedifferentiation. Studies presented here demonstrate that protein kinase A (PKA) activity is significantly elevated in hepatocytes on type I collagen gel relative to collagen film, and inhibition of this elevated \{PKA\} activity can promote hepatocyte cell cycle progression on collagen gel. Additional studies are presented that examine changes in hepatocyte cell cycle progression and differentiation in response to increased rigidity of polymerized collagen gel by fiber cross‐linking. Potential mechanisms underlying these cellular responses and their implications are discussed.}}

In this review, we describe blue and red light photoreceptors in bacteria, plants, and animals in relation to their evolution. Analyses performed in different organisms have revealed wonderful examples of structural modifications of the light‐sensing proteins themselves, as well as diversification of the signal transduction pathways they use in relation with their evolutionary history and function. In different organisms, the same photoreceptor may have a very conserved role (convergent evolution of function) or may modulate different responses (acquisition of new function). Multiple photoreceptors of the same family in the same organism indicate gene duplication events during evolution, with a consequent enhanced sensitivity to variations in ambient light. Conversely, two different photoreceptors may be involved in the control of the same physiological response. Genomic analysis in marine diatoms, combined with phylogenetic studies, has also revealed the presence of blue and red light photoreceptors in the marine environment. This discovery has intriguing implications for the understanding of light perception and its evolution in photosynthetic organisms. In addition, the characterization of these photoreceptors likely will add to our understanding of photoreceptor diversity as an adaptation to different habitats.}}

The basement membrane usually faces cell membranes on one surface and extracellular matrix components on the other; however, there are a few locations where basement membranes face cell layers on both surfaces. To understand the role of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) as a macromolecular filter, it is necessary to reiterate some of the structural and physiological features of the glomerulus. The general function of the renal glomerulus is to filter the blood and produces a protein‐free filtrate of the blood plasma. The main function of the renal tubules is to reabsorb the glomerular filtrate and produce hypertonic urine. The renal tubule is composed of several segments. The property of all these basement membranes is to allow light to traverse freely and this is accomplished irrespective of the compositional and molecular organization of these structures.}}

The model depends, unconventionally, on disinhibition of inhibitory links between excitatory neurons rather than long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory projections. The model may be shown to have advantages over traditional neural network models both in terms of information storage capacity and biological plausibility. The learning and recall algorithms are independent of network architecture, and require no thresholds or finely graded synaptic strengths. Several copies of this local network are then connected by means of many, weak, reciprocal, excitatory projections that allow one region to control the recall of information in another to produce behaviors analogous to serial memory, classical and operant conditioning, secondary reinforcement, refabrication of memory, and fabrication of possible future events. The network distinguishes between perceived and recalled events, and can predicate its response on the absence as well as the presence of particular stimuli. Some of these behaviors are achieved in ways that seem to provide instances of self-awareness and imagination, suggesting that consciousness may emerge as an epiphenomenon in simple brains.}}

The genetic tractability of bacteria, in particular Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and yeast has allowed rapid progress in elucidating the types of strategy used for the control of gene expression at the level of transcription. The \{RNAP\} is evolutionarily conserved in sequence, structure, and function from bacteria to humans. The simple (in terms of subunit composition) bacterial \{RNAP\} is an excellent model system to study the control of gene transcription. This chapter also describes the components of such a system and how they interact to allow regulation of \{RNAP\} activity at the level of the \{DNA\} opening event (i.e., open complex formation) necessary for trancription initiation.}}

We have been interested in the multiple roles of \{GSTs\} in counteracting xenobiotic-induced stress in plants and the induction of these enzymes by herbicide safeners, which act without the need for large-scale \{ROI\} accumulation. Safeners are compounds that enhance herbicide tolerance in cereals and are known to induce the expression of different classes of xenobiotic-detoxifying enzymes, which we have collectively termed the xenome. It has been proposed that safeners act by enhancing the detoxification of xenobiotics. However, we propose that safeners primarily protect plants by inducing a specific subset of antioxidant responses that relate to the endogenous functions of the xenome. Using \{GSTs\} as an example of multifunctional protective proteins, we examine this paradigm for safener action and what it tells us about antioxidant signalling pathways in plants.}}

The muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine-M (10μM), induced rhythmic bursting only in immature piriform cortex slices; however, paroxysmal depolarizing shift amplitude, burst duration and burst incidence were inversely related to postnatal age. No significant age-dependent changes in neuronal membrane properties or postsynaptic muscarinic responsiveness accounted for this decline. Burst incidence was higher when recorded in anterior and posterior regions of the immature piriform cortex. In adult and immature neurones, oxotremorine-M effects were abolished by M1-, but not M2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-selective antagonists. Rostrocaudal lesions, between piriform cortex layers I and II, or layer \{III\} and endopiriform nucleus in adult or immature slices did not influence oxotremorine-M effects; however, the slow afterdepolarization in adult (but not immature) lesioned slices was abolished. Gap junction blockers (carbenoxolone or octanol) disrupted muscarinic bursting and diminished the slow afterdepolarization in immature slices, suggesting that gap junction connectivity was important for bursting. Our data show that neural networks within layers II–III function as primary oscillatory circuits for burst initiation in immature rat piriform cortex during persistent muscarinic receptor activation. Furthermore, we propose that muscarinic slow afterdepolarization induction and gap junction communication could contribute towards the increased epileptiform susceptibility of this brain area.}}

Previous experiments using a [Ca2+]i clamp technique have demonstrated that specificity is encoded by the [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency since cytokine transcription factors are activated in a frequency-dependent manner. An outstanding question is how encoding of specific activation occurs under physiological conditions. In this case, continuous \{TCR\} interactions with specific peptides bound to cell surface-associated major histocompatibility complexes are driving the sustained [Ca2+]i increase. Addressing this question, we analyzed [Ca2+]i time series from individual T-cells mathematically. We are able to identify signal fluctuations associated with the TCR-triggering dynamics. We also find that [Ca2+]i time series associated with T-cells activated to IFN-γ production exhibit oscillations with higher frequencies than the time series corresponding to T-cells not activated to IFN-γ production. We show that signal autocorrelations are a means to distinguish functional signals according to their associated cytokine production. The signal level, however, allows for the distinction of nonfunctional from functional signals. These findings provide strong evidence for specificity encoding of biological functions in intracellular signals via signal level and signal correlations.}}

Developmental systems, particularly the nervous system, have provided key observations supporting the physiological role of PCD. We have recently shown that transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) plays an important role in mediating ontogenetic \{PCD\} in the nervous system. As part of the central nervous system the developing retina serves as an ideal model system for investigating apoptotic processes during neurogenesis in vivo as it is easily accessible experimentally and less complex due to its limited number of different neurons. This review summarizes data indicating a pivotal role of TGF‐β in mediating \{PCD\} in the vertebrate retina. The following topics are discussed: expression of TGF‐β isoforms and receptors in the vertebrate retina, the TGF‐β signaling pathway, functions and molecular mechanisms of \{PCD\} in the nervous system, TGF‐β‐mediated retinal apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and interactions of TGF‐β with other pro‐ and antiapoptotic factors.}}

abstract = {SummaryObjective: A metaschema is a high-level abstraction network of the UMLS’s semantic network (SN) obtained from a partition of the SN’s collection of semantic types. Every metaschema has nodes, called meta-semantic types, each of which denotes a group of semantic types constituting a subject area of the SN. A new kind of metaschema, called the lexical metaschema, is derived from a lexical partition of the SN. The lexical metaschema is compared to previously derived metaschemas, e.g., the cohesive metaschema. Design: A new lexical partitioning methodology is presented based on identical word-usage among the names of semantic types and the definitions of their respective children. The lexical metaschema is derived from the application of the methodology. We compare the constituent meta-semantic types and their underlying semantic-type groups with the previously derived cohesive metaschema. A similar comparison of the lexical partition and a published partition of the \{SN\} is also carried out. Results: The lexical partition of the \{SN\} has 21 semantic-type groups, each of which represents a subject area. The lexical metaschema thus has 21 meta-semantic types, 19 meta-child-of hierarchical relationships, and 86 meta-relationships. Our comparison shows that 15 out of the 21 meta-semantic types in the lexical metaschema also appear in the cohesive metaschema, and 80 semantic types are covered by identical meta-semantic types or refinements between the two metaschemas. The comparison between the lexical partition and the semantic partition shows that they have very low similarity. Conclusion: The algorithmically derived lexical metaschema serves as an abstraction of the \{SN\} and provides views representing different subject areas. It compares favorably with the cohesive metaschema derived via the SN’s relationship configuration.}}

abstract = {Water-using processes are typically modeled as either fixed flowrate operations or fixed contaminant load operations. A new method for targeting the minimum freshwater and pinch in a single-contaminant water network is proposed, which can be applied to both kinds of operations. The method consists of plotting separate source and demand composites with flowrate as the horizontal axis and contaminant load unusually as the vertical axis. It is elegant, non-iterative, and can handle hybrid problems where both kinds of operations coexist. To design minimum freshwater networks for fixed flowrate problems, an algorithm is presented based on a newly developed principle of nearest neighbors. The principle simply states that the source streams to be chosen to satisfy a particular water demand must be the nearest available neighbors in terms of contaminant concentration. To design minimum freshwater networks for fixed contaminant load problems, the nearest neighbors algorithm is applied to process units that lie across the pinch. Units that lie entirely on one side of the pinch are satisfied by the cleanest source available on that side of the pinch. In other words, below-pinch units are satisfied by freshwater and above-pinch units are satisfied by the cleanest available stream above the pinch. Designs based on this methodology, apart from meeting the minimum freshwater target, also minimize the water flowing through the process units resulting in reduced network capital cost.}}

Thresholds for roughening and material removal, and evolution of surface morphology were measured and compared with code predictions for materials response. Powder-metallurgy (PM) tungsten is observed to undergo surface roughening and subsurface crack formation that evolves over hundreds of pulses, and which can occur both below and above the melt threshold. This roughening is worse than for other metals, and worse than for either tungsten alloyed with rhenium (W25Re), or for \{CVD\} and single-crystal forms of tungsten. Carbon, particularly the form used in composite material, appears to suffer material loss well below its sublimation point. Some engineered materials were also investigated.

In non-human primates, the olfactory neocortex is situated along the basal surface of the caudal frontal lobes, encompassing agranular and dysgranular \{OFC\} medially and agranular insula laterally, where this latter structure wraps onto the posterior orbital surface. Direct afferent inputs arrive from most primary olfactory areas, including piriform cortex, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, in the absence of an obligatory thalamic relay. While such findings are almost exclusively derived from animal data, recent cytoarchitectonic studies indicate a close anatomical correspondence between non-human primate and human OFC. Given this cross-species conservation of structure, it has generally been presumed that the olfactory projection area in human \{OFC\} occupies the same posterior portions of \{OFC\} as seen in non-human primates. This review questions this assumption by providing a critical survey of the localization of primate and human olfactory neocortex. Based on a meta-analysis of human functional neuroimaging studies, the region of human \{OFC\} showing the greatest olfactory responsivity appears substantially rostral and in a different cytoarchitectural area than the orbital olfactory regions as defined in the monkey. While this anatomical discrepancy may principally arise from methodological differences across species, these results have implications for the interpretation of prior human lesion and neuroimaging studies and suggest constraints upon functional extrapolations from animal data.}}

Individuals behavior is modeled by a greedy algorithm that, given a source and destination, forwards a message to the neighbor of the current holder, which is the closest to the destination. This algorithm computes paths of expected length Θ ( log 2 n / k ) between any pair of nodes. Other topologies have been proposed later on to improve greedy algorithm performance. But, Aspnes et al. [Fault-tolerant routing in peer-to-peer systems, in: Proc. of \{ACM\} 3st Symp. on Princ. of Distr. Comp. (PODC 2002), Vol. 31, 2002, pp. 223–232] shows that for a wide class of long-range link distributions, the expected length of the path computed by this algorithm is always Ω ( log 2 n / ( k 2 log log n ) ) . We design and analyze a new decentralized routing algorithm, in which nodes consult their neighbors near by, before deciding to whom forward the message. Our algorithm uses similar amount of computational resources as Kleinberg's greedy algorithm: it is easy to implement, visits O ( log 2 n / log 2 ( 1 + k ) ) nodes on expectation and requires only Θ ( log 2 n / log ( 1 + k ) ) bits of memory—note that [G.S. Manku, M. Naor, U. Wieder, Know thy neighbor's neighbor: the power of lookahead in randomized \{P2P\} networks, in: Proc. of 36th \{ACM\} \{STOC\} 2004, 2004, to appear], shows that any decentralized algorithm visits at least Ω ( log 2 n / k ) on expectation. Our algorithm computes however a path of expected length O ( log n ( log log n ) 2 / log 2 ( 1 + k ) ) between any pair of nodes. Our algorithm might fit better some human social behaviors (such as web browsing) and may also have successful applications to peer-to-peer networks where the length of the path along which the files are downloaded, is a critical parameter of the network performance.}}

This paper first generalises \{RCAT\} to multiple (more than two) cooperating agents, which removes the need for multiple applications and inductive proofs in cooperations of an arbitrary number of processes. A new result shows a simple stochastic equivalence between cooperating, synchronised processes and corresponding parallel, asynchronous processes. This greatly simplifies the proof of the new, multi-agent theorem, which includes a statement of the desired product-form solution itself as a product of given state probabilities in the parallel components. The reversed process and product-form thus derived rely on a solution to certain rate equations and it is shown, for the first time, that a unique solution exists under mild conditions—certainly for queueing networks and G-networks.}}

The spatio-temporal characteristic of cells' \{RFs\} was tested with light spot randomly presented at different points along the receptive field axis. The cessation of cortical input decreased spontaneous activity of most of the \{LGN\} cells (64%; as compared to 36% with increased background firing). Similarly, their visually evoked responses were reduced (70% cells; compared to 24% with increased response) and extent of central excitatory domains diminished. In contrast, the majority of \{PGN\} neurons increased their spontaneous activity (62%; compared to 38% with decreased firing rate). Cortical cooling resulted also in a decrease of the \{ON\} and \{OFF\} central responses of most \{PGN\} cells (55%; as compared to 20% with increased responses). The described effects were more pronounced within the population of cells in X than in Y pathway. Although the removal of descending cortical excitation disturbed the balance of activity within the network of thalamic cells the gain of the geniculate relay was preserved. We conclude that the main role exerted by the cortico-thalamic pathway serves facilitation of the ascending retino-cortical flow of visual information at the level of lateral geniculate nucleus.}}

We identify the range of parameter values which give rise to realistic food webs and give arguments which allow some of the structure which is found to be understood in an intuitive way. Since the webs are evolved according to the rules of the model, the strengths of the predator–prey links are not determined a priori, and emerge from the process of constructing the web. We measure the distribution of these link strengths, and find that there are a large number of weak links, in agreement with recent suggestions. We also review some of the data on food webs available in the literature, and make some tentative comparisons with our results. The difficulties of making such comparisons and the possible future developments of the model are also briefly discussed.}}

We address variations in geometry along individual cycloid segments, characterizing differences in cusp styles and angles, and addressing the morphologic aspects of cycloid segments and cusps. In so doing, we illustrate how geometric and morphologic evidence imply a formation mechanism that differs from the existing model in several aspects. The current model states that cycloids are initiated as tensile fractures that grow in a curved path in response to rotating diurnal tidal stresses on Europa. However, the geometry of a cycloid cusp necessitates that shear stress was resolved onto the existing cycloid segment by the rotating diurnal stresses at the instant of cusp formation. Furthermore, we observe that cycloid cusps have a strikingly similar geometry to tailcracks that developed at the tips of many ridge-like strike-slip faults on Europa in response to shearing at the fault tip. We suggest that this similarity in geometries can be attributed to an identical formation mechanism whereby cycloid cusps form by a tailcracking process. We therefore present a revised, mechanically-based model for cycloid formation that retains the basic premise that crack growth is governed by diurnal stresses, but describes the development of cycloid cusps in response to resolved shear stresses at the tips of existing cycloid segments. The ratio of normal to shear stress at the time of tailcrack formation dictates the cusp angle and, over longer time periods, influences the morphologic evolution of the cycloid segment as it is repeatedly reworked by tidal stresses.}}

Using the example of the Movement of Unemployed Workers (El Movimiento de Trabajadores Desocupados) in Argentina, I explore the idea of autonomous geographies and how they are made and remade at three overlapping levels: the territorial, through the emergence of networked autonomous neighbourhoods which are selectively open and closed to translocal links; the material, through the development of a solidarity economy where immediate needs are met and work is redefined, and; the social, where collective action and daily practice helps constitute more collective, autonomous forms of social interactions. In their desire to manage connections with the outside world while at the same time inspire autonomous place projects elsewhere, the \{MTDs\} represent both a ‘militant localism’ and ‘militant pluriversalism’. Moreover, while such experiments in making and embedding ‘autonomous geographies’ face limits and have few widespread examples on which to draw, it is through constant questioning and collective struggle at the everyday level that autonomy is made real.}}

abstract = {Macular exudative manifestations secondary to choroidal neovascular lesions remain the leading cause of definitive visual impairment and legal blindness in the elderly. During the past decade, advances in ophthalmic imaging systems have enabled the recognition of presumed new distinct choroidal neovascular lesions that share some unique clinical and angiographic peculiarities as well as better comprehension of the pathophysiologic mechanisms related to such entities. Amongst presumed newer exudative maculopathies, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, which has been described as a distinct choroidal abnormality characterized by inner choroidal vascular network of vessels ending in polyp-like structures only identified on indocyanine green angiography and mostly affecting African–American and Asian descendents, has gained special interest from the ophthalmic community particularly because of its growing recognition among patients with clinical appearance of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Thus far, however, the exact nature of the vascular structure of the polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy lesion remains unclear and data from recent studies have conflicted with the initial concept of a benign exudative maculopathy with long-term preservation of good vision. All together, such factors make difficult the establishment of an appropriate treatment, if any, for the entity. Herein, by using a modified technique of conventional indocyanine green angiography, we demonstrate new information about the morphologic characteristics, and to some extent the blood flow dynamics perfusion, of the polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy lesion. Our results suggest that the \{PCV\} lesion should be considered a variety of choroidal neovascularization rather than a distinct clinical entity, characterized by one single large neovascular complex presenting well-defined arterial neovascular vessels arising from one major “ingrowth site” and draining vessels that present aneurysm-like dilations corresponding to the polyp-like structures typically described for the entity. Finally, the visual acuity and angiographic findings observed after selective ingrowth site photothrombosis corroborate the existence of one major “ingrowth site” for the \{PCV\} neovascular complex and point toward a new treatment paradigm for this variety of choroidal neovascularization.}}

In this article, we review and evaluate these attempts, both at the level of theoretical framework and empirical instantiation. We trace the dynamic systems approach to emotional development from theoretical origins in the work of Fogel and Wolff to the more recent framework of Lewis. We also chart its empirical applications from the standpoint of research strategy specific to the approach. We also explore the challenges this approach faces in promoting its framework as both unique and beneficial to the study of stability and change in emotion.}}

Genetic factors are thought to represent important determinants of drug efficacy and toxicity. Pharmacogenetics focuses on the prediction of the response of tumor and normal tissue to standard therapy by genetic profiling and, thereby, to select the most appropriate medication at optimal doses for each individual patient. In the present review, we discuss the relevance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes, whose gene products act upstream of the actual drug target sites, that is, drug transporters and drug metabolizing phase I and \{II\} enzymes, or downstream of them, that is, apoptosis-regulating genes and chemokines. \{SNPs\} in relevant genes, which encode for proteins that interact with anticancer drugs, were also considered, that is, enzymes of \{DNA\} biosynthesis and metabolism, \{DNA\} repair enzymes, and proteins of the mitotic spindle. A significant body of evidence supports the concept of predicting drug efficacy and toxicity by \{SNP\} genotyping. As the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy, as well as the drug-related toxicity in normal tissues is multifactorial in nature, sophisticated approaches such as genome-wide linkage analyses and integrate drug pathway profiling may improve the predictive power compared with genotyping of single genes. The implementation of pharmacogenetics into clinical routine diagnostics including genotype-based recommendations for treatment decisions and risk assessment for practitioners represents a challenge for the future.}}

Continuous cropping under no-tillage in the region increased \{SOC\} by 0.27 ± 0.19 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, which is similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimate for net annual change in C stocks from improved cropland management. Soil organic C sequestration potential for rangelands was highly variable due to the diversity of plant communities, soils, and landscapes, underscoring the need for additional long-term C cycling research on rangeland. Despite high variability, grazing increased \{SOC\} by 0.16 ± 0.12 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 and converting cropland or reclaimed mineland to grass increased \{SOC\} by 0.94 ± 0.86 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. Although there was generally poor geographical coverage throughout the region with respect to estimates of \{N2O\} and \{CH4\} flux, emission of \{N2O\} was greatest in irrigated cropland, followed by non-irrigated cropland, and rangeland. Rangeland and non-irrigated cropland appeared to be a sink for atmospheric CH4, but the size of this sink was difficult to determine given the few studies conducted. Researchers in the region are challenged to fill the large voids of knowledge regarding CO2, N2O, and \{CH4\} flux from cropland and rangeland in the northwestern \{USA\} and western Canada, as well as integrate such data to determine the net effect of agricultural management on radiative forcing of the atmosphere.}}

The paper sets out to analyse this dominant discourse, juxtaposing the language of transparency and accountability used by those promoting anti-corruption initiatives with the socio-political reality of a specific political culture/system – in this case that of post-revolutionary Nicaragua. Following a brief general discussion of the dynamics of governance reforms in Central America, the growth of international interest in combating corruption is discussed and a critique of the dominant approaches towards the issue outlined. This critique is then extended through an exploration of the evolution of anti-corruption initiatives in Nicaragua under the administration of President Arnoldo Alemán (1996–2001), which saw both an expansion in internationally sanctioned anti-corruption programmes and a catalogue of abuses that eventually culminated in Alemán's jailing under his successor.}}

However, if for any reason the network cannot tolerate such gross structural changes then accelerating networks are constrained to have sizes below some critical value. This is of interest as the regulatory gene networks of single-celled prokaryotes are characterized by an accelerating quadratic growth and are size constrained to be less than about 10,000 genes encoded in \{DNA\} sequence of less than about 10 megabases. This paper presents a probabilistic accelerating network model for prokaryotic gene regulation which closely matches observed statistics by employing two classes of network nodes (regulatory and non-regulatory) and directed links whose inbound heads are exponentially distributed over all nodes and whose outbound tails are preferentially attached to regulatory nodes and described by a scale-free distribution. This model explains the observed quadratic growth in regulator number with gene number and predicts an upper prokaryote size limit closely approximating the observed value.}}

Drawing upon a case study of rural policy making and implementation in the English West Midlands, this paper explores current institutional structures for rural policy making and how further administrative decentralisation or political devolution might enhance them. It reveals a complex set of fragmented structures and blurred accountabilities in which policy implementation is an outstanding concern. The Government's administrative reforms, together with proposals to decentralise responsibility for rural service delivery, may assist in promoting greater differentiation and co-ordination at the regional tier. Nonetheless, in the absence of the transfer of significant resources and influence to an elected regional body, efforts to establish a more distinct and coherent approach to rural policy-making and delivery will continue to be hampered.}}

Software communication protocols are often the performance bottleneck. Several current and proposed parallel systems address this problem by dedicating one general-purpose processor in a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) node specifically for protocol processing. This protocol processing convention reduces communication latency and increases effective bandwidth, but also reduces the peak performance since the dedicated processor no longer performs computation. In this paper, we study a parallel machine with \{SMP\} nodes and compare two protocol processing policies: the Fixed policy, which uses a dedicated protocol processor; and the Floating policy, where all processors perform both computation and protocol processing. The results from synthetic microbenchmarks and five macrobenchmarks show that: (i) a dedicated protocol processor benefits light-weight protocols much more than heavy-weight protocols, (ii) a dedicated protocol processor is generally advantageous when there are four or more processors per node, (iii) multiprocessor node performance is not as sensitive to interrupt overhead as uniprocessor node because a message arrival is likely to find an idle processor on a multiprocessor node, thereby eliminating interrupts, (iv) the system with the lowest cost-performance will include a dedicated protocol processor when interrupt overheads are much higher than protocol weight—as in light-weight protocols.}}

It is responsible for the basal turnover of many intracellular polypeptides, the elimination of abnormal proteins and the generation of the vast majority of peptides presented by class I major histocompatibility complex molecules. Proteasomal proteolysis is also involved in the control of virtually all cellular functions and major decisions through the spatially and timely regulated destruction of essential cell regulators. Therefore, the elucidation of its molecular mechanisms is crucial for the full understanding of the physiology of cells and whole organisms. Conversely, it is increasingly clear that proteasomal degradation is either altered in numerous pathological situations, including many cancers and diseases resulting from aberrant cell differentiation, or instrumental for the development of these pathologies. This, consequently, makes it an attractive target for therapeutical intervention. There is ample evidence that most cell proteins must be polyubiquitylated prior to proteasomal degradation. If the structure and the mode of functioning of the proteasome, as well as the enzymology of ubiquitylation, are relatively well understood, how substrates are delivered to and recognized by the proteolytic machine has remained mysterious till recently. The recent literature indicates that the mechanisms involved are multiple, complex and exquisitely regulated and provides new potential targets for anti-cancer pharmacological intervention.}}

Identifying similar features on Mars is important to understand its past climate as well as the ground ice distribution. In this study, young patterned grounds are classed and mapped from the systematical analysis of Mars Observer Camera high resolution images. These features are located poleward of 55° latitude which fits the distribution of ground ice found by the Neutron Spectrometer onboard Mars Odyssey. Thermal contraction due to seasonal temperature variations is the predominant process of formation of polygons formed by cracks which sizes vary from 15 to 300 m. The small (&lt;40 m) widespread polygons are very recent and degraded by the desiccation of ground ice from the cracks which enhances the effect of ice sublimation. The large polygons (50 to 300 m) located only around the south \{CO2\} polar cap indicate the presence of ground ice and thus outline the limit of the \{CO2\} ice cap. They could be due to the blanketing of water ice deposits by the advances and retreats of the residual \{CO2\} ice cap during the last thousand years. Large (50–250 m) and homogeneous polygons similar to ice wedge polygons, hillslope stripes and solifluction lobes may indicate that specific environments such as crater floors and hillslopes could have been submitted to freeze–thaw cycles, possibly related to higher summer temperatures in periods of obliquity higher than 35°. These interpretations must be strengthened by higher resolution images such as those of the HiRise mission of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter because locations with past seasonal thaw could be of major interest as potential landing sites for the Phoenix mission.}}

Organic salmon farming has the potential to considerably reduce the social, environmental and economic risks associated with salmon farming. Salmon farming is an industry subjected to intense scrutiny and is highly controversial. The combination of these two factors was expected to reveal the use of environmental accounting in evaluating this potentially difficult, expensive strategic decision, responding to the barrage of public criticism, driven by changing environmental regulations and a potential value shift by key actors. However, interviews revealed that going organic was regarded as a normal agricultural decision, largely based on price forecasts. The shift to organic was relatively easy, unproblematic and not too expensive. The environmental pressure groups campaigns had very little impact on this decision and it was not subjected to systematic accounting evaluation. The interviews described a sector exhibiting many of the characteristics of Beck's Risk Society thesis (1992, 1995, 1996). Decision makers’ risk perception is identified as important for considering what factors are thought to be legitimate/illegitimate and powerful/weak in the decision making process. Unless risks are considered ‘real’ by the decision makers then the associated costs/benefits of doing or not doing something are not going to figure in the decision heuristics, regardless of the nature of their calculation. Environmental accounting could play a part, not necessarily at the individual farm level, but as part of a reflexive process in reconstructing the underlying knowledge of the social, environmental and economic risks of salmon farming as a whole.}}

However, various kinds of abnormal behaviours in hydrogen transport, which could hardly be explained in terms of the diffusion-control model, have been quite frequently reported by many researchers. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the anomalous behaviours of hydrogen transport observed in such hydride-forming electrodes as Pd and metal-hydrides, with particular emphasis on hydrogen extraction under the impermeable boundary conditions during the potentiostatic current transient measurement involving the potential stepping. After a brief discourse on the conventional diffusion-control model, the topics related to the boundary conditions at the electrode surface during hydrogen extraction are extensively reviewed. In particular, it is shown that the diffusion-controlled constraint should be no longer valid at the electrode surface for hydrogen extraction in case hydrogen diffusion is influenced by either the interfacial charge transfer reaction or the hydrogen transfer reaction between adsorbed state on the electrode surface and absorbed state at the electrode sub-surface. Subsequently, the atypical behaviours of current transient due to hydrogen diffusion in the presence of traps and in the coexistence of two hydride phases are treated in detail. Each of the hydrogen extraction models suggested is discussed with the aid of the anodic current transients numerically calculated based upon the theoretical electrode potential curve, and then it is exemplified by hydrogen extraction from Pd and metal-hydrides in aqueous solutions.}}

Conventional resource reservation protocols, such as \{PNNI\} and \{RSVP\} adopt an all-or-nothing approach, where partially acquired resources must be released if resources are not available at all links on the chosen path. During periods of high network load, this leads users to retry requests repeatedly, adding control traffic at exactly the time when the network’s capacity to process that control traffic is exhausted. Deferred \{REServation\} (DRES) can significantly improve performance by reducing the overall call rejection probability, allowing more traffic to be carried, using the same resources. Call admissibility is increased by deferring requests at routers for a limited period of time until resources become available. The paper includes analytical models that predict the blocking probability on a \{DRES\} multiplexor and on a multi-hop path, and simulation results for substantial network configurations, using several QoS routing methods. The results show that \{DRES\} can provide substantial performance gains over traditional reservations (upto 50% with QoS routing enabled and upto an order of magnitude for non-QoS traditional routing).}}

abstract = {Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) with quantified uncertainty for estimating water retention from soil structure and texture, organic carbon content, bulk density and derived variables are presented for the soils of the Pianura Padano–Veneta region of North Italy. A data set of 153 soil horizons from 59 soil profiles was used for calibration of parametric \{PTFs\} using a group method of data handling (GMDH); the proposed \{PTFs\} provide estimations for the Brooks and Corey water retention parameters and for water content at −5, −10, −33 and −1500 kPa matric potentials. Soil structure descriptors were retained as essential input variables to be included in the \{PTFs\} for the estimation of the Brooks and Corey water retention parameters. Calibrated \{PTFs\} were validated against two independent data sets: a local one of 122 soil horizons and a data set of 78 soil horizons selected from the \{UNSODA\} data set. Point and parametric neural network \{PTFs\} were also trained and validated on the same data sets in order to evaluate which of the two methods is more accurate. In the case of point PTFs, \{GMDH\} \{PTFs\} performed better with the exception of water content at −1500 kPa; in the case of parametric PTFs, given an a posteriori correction of the parameters estimates outside calibration ranges, neural network provided slightly better validation results, but were less accurate in the case of the training data set. Results show that the proposed \{GMDH\} \{PTFs\} provide good results for the local validation data set and that for input data within the \{PTFs\} calibration range, the estimation holds the same degree of accuracy also for the \{UNSODA\} data set. Results suggest that whenever \{PTFs\} calibrated on a local data set are available, their use should be recommended, provided an a priori control of input variable ranges. Bootstrap results and Monte Carlo analysis highlighted the need for extending the calibration data set to include poorly represented coarse textured soils in order to reduce estimation variance and improve \{PTFs\} accuracy.}}

TGF-β1-regulated apoptosis is cell type and context-dependent, indeed TGF-β1 provides signals for both cell survival or apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the role of TGF-β1 in apoptosis remains unclear. The proteins that primarily mediate the intracellular signaling of TGF-β1 are the members of the Smad family. Nevertheless, TGF-β1 signaling can also cooperate with the death receptor apoptotic pathway (Fas, TNF), with the intracellular modulators of apoptosis \{JNK\} and p38 \{MAP\} kinases, Akt, NF-κB, and with the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway mediated by members of the Bcl-2 family. Moreover, the involvement of TGF-β1 in the production of oxidative stress and in preventing the inflammatory processes required for the clearance of apoptotic bodies is further evidence of its integration into apoptotic pathways. The interaction and balance between different stimuli provides the basis for the pro- or anti-apoptotic output of TGF-β1 signaling in a given cell.}}

Many conformational diseases are caused by mutations in secretory proteins and reach from metabolic diseases, e.g. diabetes, to developmental and neurological diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease. Expression of mutant proteins disrupts protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causes \{ER\} stress, and activates a signaling network called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The \{UPR\} increases the biosynthetic capacity of the secretory pathway through upregulation of \{ER\} chaperone and foldase expression. In addition, the \{UPR\} decreases the biosynthetic burden of the secretory pathway by downregulating expression of genes encoding secreted proteins. Here we review our current understanding of how an unfolded protein signal is generated, sensed, transmitted across the \{ER\} membrane, and how downstream events in this stress response are regulated. We propose a model in which the activity of \{UPR\} signaling pathways reflects the biosynthetic activity of the ER. We summarize data that shows that this information is integrated into control of cellular events, which were previously not considered to be under control of \{ER\} signaling pathways, e.g. execution of differentiation and starvation programs.}}

These critical approaches, however, are not critical insofar as they tacitly assume that the phenomenon of enjoyment is just enjoyment: easily enjoyed and unrelated to the problems of tourism. The main thesis of this paper is that a thorough theoretical conceptualization of enjoyment is necessary for any analysis of tourism to be sufficiently rigorous. The psychoanalytic concepts of Jacques Lacan and the work of Slavoj Žižek offer an unparalleled theoretical vocabulary with which to investigate the subjective, material, embodied, discursive, and enacted dimensions of enjoyment in tourism. The paper elaborates what I call a politics of enjoyment using key psychoanalytic ideas that include jouissance, the pleasure principle, the Other, and fantasy to critically explicate the contradictions, antagonisms, and impasses that (de)structure Jamaica's “One Love” and “No Problem” tourism product located on a Caribbean island renowned for beach bliss and civil unrest.}}

T cells are thymus-derived lymphocytes with clonally distributed surface receptors that recognize and respond to antigen in association with self-major histocompatibility antigens expressed on antigen-presenting cells. Depending on the nature of the signals they receive following antigen recognition, they can differentiate into effector cells with cytotoxic (Tc), helper (Th), or regulatory (Treg) functions. The picture that has emerged is more complex than what was imagined earlier, and hundreds of different molecules that determine T-cell responses have now been identified, including cell-surface receptors and soluble cytokines. Experimental investigations need to be combined with mathematical modeling if the understanding of T-cell responses is to progress beyond being purely descriptive. The need for a mathematical approach is exemplified by the increasing number of mathematical models published in recent years dealing with all aspects of T-cell biology. The essence of a good model is to understand and make predictions of biological behavior in the simplest way possible. In biology, this can mean finding the minimum number of key components and interactions required for a particular function, which is often a difficult task.}}

Face recognition systems based on visual images have reached a significant level of maturity with some practical success. However, the performance of visual face recognition may degrade under poor illumination conditions or for subjects of various skin colors. \{IR\} imagery represents a viable alternative to visible imaging in the search for a robust and practical identification system. While visual face recognition systems perform relatively reliably under controlled illumination conditions, thermal \{IR\} face recognition systems are advantageous when there is no control over illumination or for detecting disguised faces. Face recognition using 3D images is another active area of face recognition, which provides robust face recognition with changes in pose. Recent research has also demonstrated that the fusion of different imaging modalities and spectral components can improve the overall performance of face recognition.}}

In this review data from a wide variety of plant \{PCD\} systems is analyzed to compare what is known about the underlying mechanisms. Although senescence is clearly an important part of plant development, only what is known about \{PCD\} during senescence is dealt with here. In each \{PCD\} system the extracellular and intracellular signals triggering \{PCD\} are considered and both cytological and molecular data are discussed to determine whether a unique model for plant \{PCD\} can be derived. In the majority of cases reviewed, \{PCD\} is accompanied by the formation of a large vacuole, which ruptures to release hydrolytic enzymes that degrade the cell contents, although this model is clearly not universal. \{DNA\} degradation and the activation of proteases is also common to most plant \{PCD\} systems, where they have been studied; however, breakdown of \{DNA\} into nucleosomal units (DNA laddering) is not observed in all systems. Caspase‐like activity has also been reported in several systems, but the extent to which it is a necessary feature of all plant \{PCD\} has not yet been established. The trigger for tonoplast rupture is not fully understood, although active oxygen species (AOS) have been implicated in several systems. In two systems, self incompatibility and tapetal breakdown as a result of cytoplasmic male sterility, there is convincing evidence for the involvement of mitochondria including release of cytochrome c. However, in other systems, the role of the mitochondrion is not clear‐cut. How cells surrounding the cell undergoing \{PCD\} protect themselves against death is also discussed as well as whether there is a link between the eventual fate of the cell corpse and the mechanism of its death.}}

In this review, we first summarize known features of the \{DNA\} damage response, emphasizing those elements that function as sensors of \{DNA\} damage, transducers of the damage signal, or effectors that mediate the response. Subsequently, we focus on aspects of the fungal \{DNA\} damage response that distinguish it from the well-characterized yeast models. These include the characterization of conserved repair proteins that first appear in the multicellular fungi, the potential role of hyphal cell death in the fungal \{DNA\} damage response, the challenge of regulating the response in a multinucleate cell, and the novel interaction between cell cycle checkpoints and hyphal morphogenesis. Although, in some cases, our analyses may be somewhat speculative, we propose that these aspects of the fungal \{DNA\} damage response may serve as valuable models that yield important insight into analogous processes in other multicellular eukaryotes.}}

Environmental toxicants such as metals, pesticides, and organics may induce immunosuppression. The chapter describes the fish immune system emphasizing aspects most relevant to current immunotoxicology testing schemes. The chapter focuses on the effects of metals and organometals, pesticide, aromatic hydrocarbons, and intracellular signaling events triggered by toxicant exposures. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some evidences for substantial effects of oxygen and pH on the fish immune system, arguing that the immunotoxic impacts of xenobiotics must be considered in light of variations as well as other natural stressors.}}

As part of the characterization of non-HKD-PLDs, enzymes structurally and possibly functionally related to at least one of the non-HKD PLDs, which from Streptomyces chromofuscus, are discussed. It would not come as a surprise if some of these enzymes, or similar ones yet to be described, should turn out to be involved in the control of \{PA\} concentration and in signaling. Any intracellular enzyme capable of generating \{PA\} from phospholipids could play a role in signal transduction pathways. The only non-HKD enzyme thus far that is known to contribute to signaling is autotaxin, which generates \{LPA\} from LPC. It is a secreted protein and exhibits specificity for lyso-PC. Clearly, more biochemical and structural information on the role of metal ions in this enzyme is needed to see if it falls in a similar metalloenzyme class as scPLD and similar phosphodiesterases. The only known mammalian \{PLD\} that is a confirmed metalloprotein is GPI-PLD. However, the GPI-PLD appears to play a role in membrane remodeling when it is inside cells. When secreted, its activity is reduced significantly, making activity toward GPI-linked proteins problematic. NAPE-PLD, another potential metallo-PLD, works on a very specific product that is produced at very low concentrations. While action of these latter two \{PLDs\} does generate PA, the amounts are unlikely to contribute to basal \{PA\} levels in cell membranes.}}

It address fundamental questions concerning the response of animal and/or human cells to carcinogens and tumor promoters, such as \{UV\} light, arsenic, TPA, and growth factors and established a series of necessary models or systems, such as the over-agar assay for cell transformation , gene knockout mice, transcription factor/luciferase promoter stably transfected cells and transgenic mice, as well as gene knockdown (siRNA) or dominant-negative mutant stably transfected cell lines. These models have been extensively utilized to examine the tumor promoter-induced signal transduction pathways and their role in cell neoplastic transformation. The chapter discusses the signal transduction networks induced by UVA, \{UVB\} and UVC, and describes the critical roles of \{MAP\} kinases at all three unique wavelengths of UV-induced signal transduction pathways. Some of the most interesting and well documented are resveratrol and components of tea, EGCG, theaflavins, and caffeine. Other potentially effective dietary compounds include inositol hexaphosphate, PEITC, ginger, and CAPE. A continuing emphasis on obtaining rigorous research data and critical analysis of those data regarding these and other food factors is vital to determine the molecular basis and long-term effectiveness and safety of these compounds as chemopreventive agents. Large-scale animal and molecular biology studies are needed to address the bioavailability, toxicity, molecular target, signal transduction pathways, and side effects of dietary factors. Clinical trials based on clear mechanistic studies are also needed to assess the effectiveness of these dietary factors in the human population.}}

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the morphogenetic cell movements and underlying molecular mechanisms implicated in shaping the zebrafish body plan during gastrulation. During early embryogenesis, inductive and morphogenetic processes cooperate to ensure that the three germ layers—ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm—are specified, and correctly positioned and shaped within the developing embryo. As a result, an initially simple blastula consisting of many blastomeres piled atop a large yolk cell, is transformed into an embryo with defined anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. Three main morphogenetic processes operate concurrently during gastrulation to shape the early embryo including epiboly, internalization, and convergence and extension. While epiboly and internalization are completed by the end of the gastrula period, at 10 hours post-fertilization (hpf ), convergence and extension movements continue through segmentation. These morphogenetic processes are very dynamic, and overlap in time and space, such that a given cell, depending on its position, can simultaneously engage in more than one process. Therefore, the movement behaviors employed by a cell to achieve its appropriate position within the developing embryo are quite diverse, both in their execution and molecular regulation. The chapter examines the molecules and signaling pathways that orchestrate and mediate these behaviors.}}

abstract = {Summary In comparison with the well-known examples of eco-industrial parks, the interconnected metal production and recycling system is a less recognized example of industrial ecology in practice. The metallurgical industries minimized the use of resources and production of wastes by interchanging resources, intermediates and residues between processes. As a result, the production of metals is so interdependent that they can hardly be considered separately. The metal production and recycling system is an excellent case to study the potential of the current descriptive approaches to design and manage industrial systems as industrial ecosystems. To date, however, industrial ecology studies on metals production and recycling lack a sufficient depth to invoke improvement for metal processing and recycling systems. Because the metal production and recycling capacity is realized by a dynamic network of reactors, tools to invoke improvement in this capacity also require modelling at level of reactors. The metal wheel is introduced as a simple means to visualize the interdependencies in metals processing. It can be used in the establishment of system boundaries. The (dynamic) interdependence in metals processing resulting from the ecosystem organization calls for a different model approach than for other resources that are less interdependent. Capturing the interdependence in \{MFA\} models requires modelling the interconnections between the metal process steps, i.e. based on detailed mass balances of individual processes and process steps. Without sufficient detail on the underlying networks of process steps, the flows between the different metal production circuits, but also from and into the environment can not be adequately estimated. To construct a quantitative description of the metal cycles, it is necessary to rely on a mix of information from a great many sources often collected for different purposes, with different detail and accuracy. Statistical methods, in particular data reconciliation, are necessary to ensure the reliability and consistency of the data at the different system levels. The required efforts to do so may be an impediment for many (LCA) studies on the metals production and recycling system or parts of it. Additional tools to complement these (LCA) studies are required to calculate changes in the metallurgy. For these tools \{SFA\} models can be used based on reconciled mass balances of all metallurgical process steps involved. Because this is a very data-intensive process, industrial ecologists must clearly define their data requirements. Only if a model methodology is well defined, data can be collected and published in a structured way. In this context, methodological convergence in the current trends in research and modelling of environment related flows in the physical economy is essential. Such convergence could yield significant benefits with respect to the underlying data collection, accessibility and conformity. Thus it could reduce the effort of considering the interdependences in metallurgical systems. For this reason, the data underlying the quantitative description is reported in detail in the appendices. The data can serve as a solid basis for other studies on metals processing and recovery. It is essential that the metallurgical, the manufacturing and waste management industries collect and present data on the different stages in the metal cycles (i) in a way that allows modelling of these systems, and (ii) in literature available to industrial ecologists (or other people that construct material inventories) rather than in specialist or professional literature, conference proceedings etc. alone. Availability of current data is even more important considering that the metallurgical system is an evolving system. The tacit knowledge plays an important role in the development of the performance of existing processes and of the development of new processes, but can hardly be modelled. For representative modelling of metallurgical systems, industry must ensure that model data and flowsheets (the configuration of the processes) represent industrial practice.}}

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses autonomous performance and risk management in large distributed systems and grids. The \{DARPA\} UltraLog project has built and deployed a large scale experimental distributed mobile agent system designed to improve distributed system performance and survivability. The system is designed to self-adjust to meet performance and risk goals and constraints in a changing environment. The issue of performance and risk in an agent based system arises as it does with any distributed system or grid and is complicated by the autonomous and mobile nature of agents in a society. The natural parallelism present in many large scale problems makes them good candidates for an agent based solution with autonomous self-healing capabilities. The large logistics applications that are used as a test bed for \{DARPA\} Ultralog serve as testimony to the ability of large agent based systems to solve some of the world's most complex tasks in grid computing. The UltraLog system is designed to be a highly flexible and robust computing architecture that can meet requirements in performance and reliability and withstand attacks.}}

We have studied MFS, in 7, 14 and 21 day in vitro (DIV) organotypic slice cultures, or in slice cultures treated with pilocarpine (0.5 mM) or pilocarpine and atropine (0.1 mM or 0.5 mM) for 48–72 h at 5 \{DIV\} and tested at 21 DIV. Acute application of pilocarpine directly activated hilar neurons and elicited epileptic-like discharges in \{CA3\} pyramids and mossy cells of 5–8 \{DIV\} cultures, without causing substantial cell death, as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase measurements. Timm staining revealed increases in \{MFS\} in chronic pilocarpine-treated cultures, which was prevented by prior application of atropine. Extracellular synaptic responses were recorded in the granule cell layer and elicited by antidromic mossy fibre stimulation. The \{GABAA\} antagonist 6-imino-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1(6H)-pyridazinebutanoic acid (1μM) induced a greater increase in the coastline bursting index in pilocarpine-treated cultures than in 21 \{DIV\} controls. However, there was no significant increase in the frequency of spontaneous or miniature synaptic events recorded in granule cells from pilocarpine-treated cultures. Granule cells were filled with biocytin and morphometric analysis revealed that the length of axon collaterals in the granule and molecular layer was longer in pilocarpine-treated cultures than in 21 \{DIV\} controls. Dual recordings between granule cells and between granule and hilar neurons showed that pilocarpine-treated cultures had a larger proportion of monosynaptic and polysynaptic connections. The group \{II\} metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist \{LY354740\} (0.5 μM) suppressed excitatory but not inhibitory monosynaptic currents. \{LY354740\} also inhibited antidromically evoked action currents in granule cells from pilocarpine- and to a lesser extent in pilocarpine and atropine-treated cultures, suggesting that group \{II\} mGluRs can reside along the axon and suppress action potential invasion. We provide direct evidence for the development of functional \{MFS\} and suggest a novel, axonal mechanism by which presynaptic group \{II\} mGluRs can inhibit selected synapses.}}

Understanding of the role of these structural changes in producing functional deficits in brain aging and neuropsychiatric disorders requires accurate three-dimensional representations of neuronal morphology, and realistic biophysical modeling that can directly relate structural changes to altered neuronal firing patterns. To date however, tools capable of resolving, digitizing and analyzing neuronal morphology on both local and global scales, and with sufficient throughput and automation, have been lacking. The precision of existing image analysis-based morphometric tools is restricted at the finest scales, where resolution of fine dendritic features and spine geometry is limited by the skeletonization methods used, and by quantization errors arising from insufficient imaging resolution. We are developing techniques for imaging, reconstruction and analysis of neuronal morphology that capture both local and global structural variation. To minimize quantization error and evaluate more precisely the fine geometry of dendrites and spines, we introduce a new shape analysis technique, the Rayburst sampling algorithm that uses the original grayscale data rather than the segmented images for precise, continuous radius estimation, and multidirectional radius sampling to represent non-circular branch cross-sections and anisotropic structures such as dendritic spine heads, with greater accuracy. We apply the Rayburst technique to 3D neuronal shape analysis at different scales. We reconstruct and digitize entire neurons from stacks of laser-scanning microscopy images, as well as globally complex structures such as multineuron networks and microvascular networks. We also introduce imaging techniques necessary to recover detailed information on three-dimensional mass distribution and surface roughness of amyloid beta plaques from human Alzheimer’s disease patients and from the Tg2576 mouse that expresses the “Swedish” mutation of the amyloid precursor protein. By providing true three-dimensional morphometry of complex histologic structures on multiple scales, the tools described in this report will enable multiscale biophysical modeling studies capable of testing potential mechanisms by which altered dendritic structure, spine geometry and network branching patterns that occur in normal aging and in many brain disorders, determine deficits of functions such as working memory and cognition.}}

Perhaps the most dramatic case is that of mutations in A‐type lamins, intermediate filament proteins associated with the inner nuclear membrane. Different mutations in the same lamin proteins have been shown to cause striated muscle diseases, partial lipodystrophy syndromes, a peripheral neuropathy, and disorders with features of severe premature aging.

In this study, the region is divided into five structural domains with distinct, but related, histories: (1) The southern Panamint domain is a structurally intact, gently south-tilted block dominated by a middle Miocene volcanic center recognized as localized hypabyssal intrusives surrounded by proximal facies pyroclastic rocks. This Miocene volcanic sequence is an unusual alkaline volcanic assemblage ranging from trachybasalt to rhyolite, but dominated by trachyandesite. The volcanic rocks are overlain in the southwestern Panamint Mountains by a younger (Late Miocene?) fanglomerate sequence. (2) An upper Wingate Wash domain is characterized by large areas of Quaternary cover and complex overprinting of older structure by Quaternary deformation. Quaternary structures record ∼N–S shortening concurrent with ∼E–W extension accommodated by systems of strike-slip and thrust faults. (3) A central Wingate Wash domain contains a complex structural history that is closely tied to the stratigraphic evolution. In this domain, a middle Miocene volcanic package contains two distinct assemblages; a lower sequence dominated by alkaline pyroclastic rocks similar to the southern Panamint sequence and an upper basaltic sequence of alkaline basalt and basanites. This volcanic sequence is in turn overlain by a coarse clastic sedimentary sequence that records the unroofing of adjacent ranges and development of ∼N–S trending, west-tilted fault blocks. We refer to this sedimentary sequence as the Lost Lake assemblage. (4) The lower Wingate Wash/northern Owlshead domain is characterized by a gently north-dipping stratigraphic sequence with an irregular unconformity at the base developed on granitic basement. The unconformity is locally overlain by channelized deposits of older Tertiary(?) red conglomerate, some of which predate the onset of extensive volcanism, but in most of the area is overlain by a moderately thick package of Middle Miocene trachybasalt, trachyandesitic, ash flows, lithic tuff, basaltic cinder, basanites, and dacitic pyroclastic, debris, and lahar flows with localized exposures of sedimentary rocks. The upper part of the Miocene stratigraphic sequence in this domain is comprised of coarse grained-clastic sediments that are apparently middle Miocene based on Ar/Ar dating of interbedded volcanic rocks. This sedimentary sequence, however, is lithologically indistinguishable from the structurally adjacent Late Miocene Lost Lake assemblage and a stratigraphically overlying Plio-Pleistocene alluvial fan; a relationship that handicaps tracing structures through this domain. This domain is also structurally complex and deformed by a series of northwest–southeast-striking, east-dipping, high-angle oblique, sinistral, normal faults that are cut by left-lateral strike-slip faults. The contact between the southern Panamint domain and the adjacent domains is a complex fault system that we interpret as a zone of Late Miocene distributed sinistral slip that is variably overprinted in different portions of the mapped area. The net sinistral slip across the Wingate Wash fault system is estimated at 7–9 km, based on offset of Proterozoic Crystal Springs Formation beneath the middle Miocene unconformity to as much as 15 km based on offset volcanic facies in Middle Miocene rocks. To the south of Wingate Wash, the northern Owlshead Mountains are also cut by a sinistral, northwest-dipping, oblique normal fault, (referred to as the Filtonny Fault) with significant slip that separates the Lower Wingate Wash and central Owlshead domains. The Filtonny Fault may represent a young conjugate fault to the dextral Southern Death Valley fault system and may be the northwest-dipping fault imaged by \{COCORP\} studies. Similarly, younger deformation in upper Wingate Wash is probably broadly related to distributed dextral shear along the Panamint Valley fault system. Earlier deformation (Late Miocene?) is more difficult to constrain because of overprinting but appears to be dominated by an E–W extension recognized by a NNW-striking, northeast-dipping, sinistral-oblique normal faults, ∼N–S striking normal faults that splay in the northern Owlshead Mountains and include the large west-tilted fault blocks of the northern Owlshead Mountains.}}

Comparison of the present-day bathymetric setting of both former and contemporary glaciated margins reveals no clear link to the effect of neither ice sheet or sediment load. Three different types of glacially eroded shelf transverse troughs have been identified, while marginal troughs seem connected to similar geological settings everywhere. Beyond the shelf edge interaction between downslope and alongslope processes has occurred resulting, amongst others, in the formation of large sedimentary mounds on the rise. More frequent large-scale mass wasting occurs on the former glaciated \{NW\} European margin than the Greenland and Antarctic margins in the latest Neogene to recent times. A two-stage evolution of the shelf prograding wedges is observed on all margins under consideration, which may reflect a general development of an ice cover from an initial phase of non- to restricted glaciation, evolving to a mature stage of expansive glaciation.}}

abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called ‘chaos theory’, has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of \{EEG\} or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to \{EEG\} and \{MEG\} of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of ‘functional sources’ and ‘functional networks’ allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper—as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness.}}

It is quite remarkable that all of this movement is based on filaments and motor molecules which perform mechanical work on the nanometer scale. This article reviews recent theoretical work on the motility of molecular motors and motor particles that bind to cytoskeletal filaments and walk along these filaments in a directed fashion. It is emphasized that these systems exhibit several motility regimes which are well seperated in time. In their bound state, the motor particles move with a typical velocity of about 1 μ m / s . The motor cycles underlying this bound motor movement can be understood in terms of driven Brownian ratchets and networks. On larger length and time scales, the motor particles unbind from the filaments and undergo peculiar motor walks consisting of many diffusional encounters with the filaments. If the mutual exclusion (or hardcore repulsion) of these motor particles is taken into account, one finds a variety of cooperative phenomena and self-organized processes: build-up of traffic jams; active structure formation leading to steady states with spatially nonuniform density and current patterns; and active phase transitions between different steady states far from equilibrium. A particularly simple active phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking is predicted to occur in systems with two species of motor particles which walk on the filaments in opposite directions.}}

The phenotypic variation is characterized by differences in function, antigenic composition, metabolic properties, and in their response to growth factors. Continuous endothelium is characteristic of brain, retina, and muscular capillaries. While endothelial cells in brain exhibit close junctional apposition to one another and a tight permeability barrier to fluid and solutes (i.e., the blood/brain barrier), fenestrated endothelium is found in endocrine glands and the kidney. The endothelium of the glomeruli is loosely connected and readily permits the transendothelial passage of relatively large solutes. Moreover, within an organ, the endothelial cells vary with the size, function, and location of the vessel and can even vary within discrete segments of a single microcirculatory loop. As the lungs receive both right heart pulmonary circulation and left heart bronchial circulation, the endothelium of these respective systems might be expected to exhibit diversity. Because of the large capillary surface area of pulmonary circulation and the extremely fine alveolar–capillary membrane, formed by juxtaposition of the thin endothelial cell and alveolar type I epithelial cells, there is a critical necessity for maintenance of barrier integrity in the pulmonary circulation. Therefore, the function of pulmonary endothelium has received considerable investigative attention.}}

With six genetically distinct α chains (α1-α6) identified in higher organisms, type \{IV\} collagen displays the greatest molecular diversity among members of the collagen superfamily. The chapter provides a brief overview of basement membranes, highlighting their general organization, molecular composition, and function. Genomic research has revealed that type \{IV\} collagen has been conserved throughout metazoan evolution, a finding that underscores how fundamentally important these matrices must be to the basic organization of multi-cellular organisms. Studies of invertebrate models are the first to reveal the important role that type \{IV\} collagen plays during development. Hydra cell aggregate development and head regeneration is blocked when the expression or assembly of type \{IV\} collagen is disrupted, indicating a role in both cytodifferentiation and morphogenesis.}}

The extended knowledge on combustion phenomena gained by application of these diagnostic techniques, combined with equally advanced numerical simulation of the process, has been instrumental in designing modern combustion devices with efficient performance and reduced pollutant emission. Also, similar diagnostic techniques are now employed to develop sensors for process control in combustion. This article intends to give a perspective on the potential of combustion diagnostics by highlighting selected application examples and by guiding the reader to recent literature. In particular, techniques are emphasized, which permit measurement of important features of the chemical composition, sometimes in conjunction with flow field parameters.

Retinoid effects extend however beyond embryonic development, and tissue homeostasis, lipid metabolism, cellular differentiation and proliferation are in part controlled through the retinoid signaling pathway. Retinoids are also therapeutically effective in the treatment of skin diseases (acne, psoriasis and photoaging) and of some cancers. Most of these effects are the consequences of retinoic acid receptors activation, which triggers transcriptional events leading either to transcriptional activation or repression of retinoid-controlled genes. Synthetic molecules are able to mimic part of the biological effects of the natural retinoic acid receptors, all-trans retinoic acid. Therefore, retinoic acid receptors are considered as highly valuable therapeutic targets and limiting unwanted secondary effects due to retinoid treatment requires a molecular knowledge of retinoic acid receptors biology. In this review, we will examine experimental evidence which provide a molecular basis for the pleiotropic effects of retinoids, and emphasize the crucial roles of coregulators of retinoic acid receptors, providing a conceptual framework to identify novel therapeutic targets.}}

abstract = {The flexion or flexor reflex (FR) recorded in the lower limbs in humans (LLFR) is a widely investigated neurophysiological tool. It is a polysynaptic and multisegmental spinal response that produces a withdrawal of the stimulated limb and resembles (having several features in common) the hind-paw \{FR\} in animals. The FR, in both animals and humans, is mediated by a complex circuitry modulated at spinal and supraspinal level. At rest, the \{LLFR\} (usually obtained by stimulating the sural/tibial nerve and by recording from the biceps femoris/tibial anterior muscle) appears as a double burst composed of an early, inconstantly present component, called the \{RII\} reflex, and a late, larger and stable component, called the \{RIII\} reflex. Numerous studies have shown that the afferents mediating the \{RII\} reflex are conveyed by large-diameter, low-threshold, non-nociceptive A-beta fibers, and those mediating the \{RIII\} reflex by small-diameter, high-threshold nociceptive A-delta fibers. However, several afferents, including nociceptive and non-nociceptive fibers from skin and muscles, have been found to contribute to \{LLFR\} activation. Since the threshold of the \{RIII\} reflex has been shown to correspond to the pain threshold and the size of the reflex to be related to the level of pain perception, it has been suggested that the \{RIII\} reflex might constitute a useful tool to investigate pain processing at spinal and supraspinal level, pharmacological modulation and pathological pain conditions. As stated in \{EFNS\} guidelines, the \{RIII\} reflex is the most widely used of all the nociceptive reflexes, and appears to be the most reliable in the assessment of treatment efficacy. However, the \{RIII\} reflex use in the clinical evaluation of neuropathic pain is still limited. In addition to its nocifensive function, the \{LLFR\} seems to be linked to posture and locomotion. This may be explained by the fact that its neuronal circuitry, made up of a complex pool of interneurons, is interposed in motor control and, during movements, receives both peripheral afferents (flexion reflex afferents, FRAs) and descending commands, forming a multisensorial feedback mechanism and projecting the output to motoneurons. \{LLFR\} excitability, mediated by this complex circuitry, is finely modulated in a state- and phase-dependent manner, rather as we observe in the \{FR\} in animal models. Several studies have demonstrated that \{LLFR\} excitability may be influenced by numerous physiological conditions (menstrual cycle, stress, attention, sleep and so on) and pathological states (spinal lesions, spasticity, Wallenberg's syndrome, fibromyalgia, headaches and so on). Finally, the \{LLFR\} is modulated by several drugs and neurotransmitters. In summary, study of the \{LLFR\} in humans has proved to be an interesting functional window onto the spinal and supraspinal mechanisms of pain processing and onto the spinal neural control mechanisms operating during posture and locomotion.}}

The wealth of data gathered allowed the conception of numerous computational models. These models proposed descriptions of the putative mechanisms generating this data, and, in turn, made predictions and helped to plan new experiments. In this article, we review the computational models of the five main brain regions involved in saccade generation: reticular formation saccadic burst generators, superior colliculus, cerebellum, basal ganglia and premotor cortical areas. We present the various topics these models are concerned with: location of the feedback loop, multimodal saccades, long-term adaptation, on the fly trajectory correction, strategy and metrics selection, short-term spatial memory, transformations between retinocentric and craniocentric reference frames, sequence learning, to name the principle ones. Our objective is to provide a global view of the whole system. Indeed, narrowing too much the modelled areas while trying to explain too much data is a recurrent problem that should be avoided. Moreover, beyond the multiple research topics remaining to be solved locally, questions regarding the operation of the whole structure can now be addressed by building on the existing models.}}

The wide range of evidence that has been scrutinized for inclusion on the glacial map is assessed with respect to the variability of its quality and quantity and the existing controversies in ice sheet reconstructions. Landforms interpreted as being of unequivocal ice-marginal origin (moraines, ice-contact glacifluvial landforms and lateral meltwater channels) and till sheet margins are used in conjunction with available chronological control to locate former glacier and ice-sheet margins throughout the last glacial cycle. Subglacial landforms (drumlins, flutings and eskers) have been used to demarcate former flow patterns within the ice sheet. The compilation of evidence in a regional map is crucial to any future reconstructions of palaeo-ice sheet dynamics and will provide a clearer understanding of ice sheet configuration, ice divide migration and ice thickness and coverage for the British Ice Sheet as it evolved through the last glacial cycle.}}

abstract = {We present a conceptual framework for a new approach to environmental calibration of planktonic foraminifer census counts. This approach is based on simultaneous application of a variety of transfer function techniques, which are trained on geographically constrained calibration data sets. It serves to minimise bias associated with the presence of cryptic species of planktonic foraminifera and provides an objective tool for assessing reliability of environmental estimates in fossil samples, allowing identification of adverse effects of no-analog faunas and technique-specific bias. We have compiled new calibration data sets for the North (N=862) and South (N=321) Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean (N=1111). We show evidence that these data sets offer adequate coverage of the Sea-Surface Temperature (SST) and faunal variation range and that they are not affected by the presence of pre-Holocene samples and/or calcite dissolution. We have applied four transfer function techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks, Revised Analog Method and \{SIMMAX\} (with and without distance weighting) on faunal counts in a Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) data set for the Atlantic Ocean (748 samples in 167 cores; based on the GLAMAP-2000 compilation) and a new data set for the Pacific Ocean (265 samples in 82 cores) and show that three of these techniques provide adequate degree of independence for the advantage of a multi-technique approach to be realised. The application of our new approach to the glacial Pacific lends support to the contraction and perhaps even a cooling of the Western Pacific Warm Pool and a substantial (&gt;3 °C) cooling of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the eastern boundary currents. Our results do not provide conclusive evidence for \{LGM\} warming anywhere in the Pacific. The Atlantic reconstruction shows a number of robust patterns, including substantial cooling of eastern boundary currents with considerable advection of subpolar waters into the Benguela Current, a cooling of the equatorial Atlantic by ∼5 °C, and steep \{SST\} gradients in the mid-latitude North Atlantic. The transfer function techniques generally agree that subtropical gyre areas in both hemispheres did not change significantly since the LGM, although the \{ANN\} technique produced glacial \{SST\} in the southern gyre 1–2 °C warmer than today. We have revisited the issue of sea-ice occurrence in the Nordic Seas and using the distribution of subpolar species of planktonic foraminifera in glacial samples, we conclude that the Norwegian Sea must have been ice-free during the summer.}}

abstract = {Dendritic spines are small protrusions that cover the surface of dendrites and bear the postsynaptic component of excitatory synapses. Having an enlarged head connected to the dendrite by a narrow neck, dendritic spines provide a postsynaptic biochemical compartment that separates the synaptic space from the dendritic shaft and allows each spine to function as a partially independent unit. Spines develop around the time of synaptogenesis and are dynamic structures that continue to undergo remodeling over time. Changes in spine morphology and density influence the properties of neural circuits. Our knowledge of the structure and function of dendritic spines has progressed significantly since their discovery over a century ago, but many uncertainties still remain. For example, several different models have been put forth outlining the sequence of events that lead to the genesis of a spine. Although spines are small and apparently simple organelles with a cytoskeleton mainly composed of actin filaments, regulation of their morphology and physiology appears to be quite sophisticated. A multitude of molecules have been implicated in dendritic spine development and remodeling, suggesting that intricate networks of interconnected signaling pathways converge to regulate actin dynamics in spines. This complexity is not surprising, given the likely importance of dendritic spines in higher brain functions. In this review, we discuss the molecules that are currently known to mediate the exquisite sensitivity of spines to perturbations in their environment and we outline how these molecules interface with each other to mediate cascades of signals flowing from the spine surface to the actin cytoskeleton.}}

These simulations have now become large enough and sophisticated enough that they are beginning to cover the entire range of grain sizes over which the experimentally suggested transition from a dislocation-based deformation mechanism to one involving \{GB\} processes takes place. Their atomic-level resolution provides novel insights into the intricate interplay between the dislocation and \{GB\} processes responsible for this crossover. These simulations also reveal how and why this crossover in the dominant mechanism leads to a transition in the mechanical behavior. However, in spite of these early successes, these simulations are inherently limited to rather idealized model microstructures and extremely high deformation rates. We therefore address the critical question as to the degree to which they begin to capture the experimentally observed, albeit controversial, deformation behavior of real nanocrystalline materials.

Striking \{CFTR\} genotypic differences are observed in cystic fibrosis (CF) and in CBAVD. The 5T allele is a \{CBAVD\} mutation with incomplete penetrance. Recent evidence confirmed that a second polymorphic locus exists and is a major \{CFTR\} modifier. The development of minigene models have led to results suggesting that \{CFTR\} exon 9 is skipped in humans because of unusual suboptimal 5′ splice sites. An extremely rare \{T3\} allele has been reported and it has recently been confirmed that the \{T3\} allele dramatically increases exon 9 skipping and should be considered as a ‘CF’ mutation. Routine testing for the most prevalent mutations in the \{CF\} Caucasian population will miss most \{CFTR\} gene alterations, which can be detected only through exhaustive scanning of \{CFTR\} sequences. Finally, a higher than expected frequency of \{CFTR\} mutations and/or polymorphisms is now found in a growing number of monosymptomatic disorders, which creates a dilemma for setting nosologic boundaries between \{CF\} and diseases related to CFTR.}}

Trained in theology and law, he rose rapidly through the prelacy, serving as dean and then provost of St Peter's Collegiate Church, Utrecht. As a member of the episcopal mensa, Wiger was also an active participant in diocesan and metropolitan affairs throughout the 1210s and 1220s; he probably even accompanied his bishop to Damietta, Egypt, to take part in the Fifth Crusade. However, after 1228, Wiger gave up his comfortable existence and joined the fledgling Franciscan Order. It was as a Minorite friar that Wiger conducted an official visitation of the order's English province in 1237. He did so at the behest of the controversial Minister General, Elias of Cortona. This essay traces Wiger's professional and scholarly attainments and explores his connection to various ecclesiastical and secular figures of the era. It examines the institutional support and material assistance offered to the mendicant movement by Wiger's associates amongst the prelacy and nobility of the Hohenstaufen Empire. Attention is also given to Master Wiger's literary activity and his status as one of the earliest identifiable creators of a searchable exempla compendium.}}
