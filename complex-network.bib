Hub repulsion plays an important role in fractal topologies. This paper models the repulsion among the nodes in the complex networks in calculation of the fractal dimension of the networks. Coulomb's law is adopted to represent the repulse between two nodes of the network quantitatively. A new method to calculate the fractal dimension of complex networks is proposed. The Sierpinski triangle network and some real complex networks are investigated. The results are illustrated to show that the new model of self-similarity of complex networks is reasonable and efficient.}}

In this paper, we propose a new concept called mapping entropy (ME) to identify the importance of a node in the complex network. The concept is established according to the local information which considers the correlation among all neighbors of a node. We evaluate the efficiency of the centrality by static and dynamic attacks on standard network models and real-world networks. The simulation result shows that the new centrality is more efficient than traditional attack strategies, whether it is static or dynamic.}}

By introducing complex networks to model mobile networks, which follows the power-law degree distribution, a novel epidemic model for mobile malware propagation is proposed.

Theoretically, the asymptotic stability of the malware-free equilibrium is confirmed when the threshold is below the unity, and the global stability is further proved under some sufficient conditions. The influences of different model parameters as well as the network topology on malware propagation are also analyzed. Our theoretical studies and numerical simulations show that networks with higher heterogeneity conduce to the diffusion of malware, and complex networks with lower power-law exponents benefit malware spreading.}}

Drawing on the news data of Bohai Gulf oil spill event from June 2011 to May 2014, we constructed a weighted and directed complex network in which media are set as nodes, the propagation relationships as edges and the propagation times as the weight of the edges. The primary results show (1) the propagation network presents small world feature, which means relations among media are close and breaking news originating from any node can spread rapidly; (2) traditional media and official websites are the typical sources for news propagation, while business portals are news collectors and spreaders; (3) the propagation network is assortative and the group of core media facilities the spread of breaking news faster; (4) for online media, news originality factor become less important to propagation behaviors. This study offers a new insight to explore information dissemination from the perspective of statistical physics and is beneficial for utilizing the public opinion in a positive way.}}

Moreover, we show that normalized Spearman ranks of stubs are subject to an interesting linear rule where the correlation coefficient is just the Spearman coefficient. This compelling linear relationship allows us to directly produce networks with any prescribed Spearman coefficient. Our method apparently has an edge over the well known uncorrelated configuration model.}}

However, the existing link prediction methods are unsatisfactory for processing topological information and have high time complexity. This paper presents a novel method of Link Prediction with Community Structure (LPCS) based on hyperbolic mapping. Different from the existing link prediction methods, to utilize global structure information of the network, LPCS deals with the network from an overall perspective. LPCS takes full advantage of the community structure and its hierarchical organization to map networks into hyperbolic space, and obtains the hyperbolic coordinates which depict the global structure information of the network, then uses hyperbolic distance to describe the similarity between the nodes, finally predicts missing links according to the degree of the similarity between unconnected node pairs. The combination of the hyperbolic geometry framework and the community structure makes LPCS perform well in predicting missing links, and the time complexity of LPCS is linear, which makes LPCS can be applied to handle large scale networks in acceptable time. LPCS outperforms many state-of-the-art link prediction methods in the networks obeying power-law degree distribution.}}

In order to quantitatively describe variations in the amount of information during the spreading process, this article proposes a safety information radiation model on the basis of communication theory, combining with relevant theories of complex networks. This model comprehensively considers the various influence factors when safety information radiates in the network, and introduces some concepts from the communication theory perspective, such as the radiation gain function, receiving gain function, information retaining capacity and information second reception capacity, to describe the safety information radiation process between nodes and dynamically investigate the states of network nodes. On a micro level, this article analyzes the influence of various initial conditions and parameters on safety information radiation through the new model simulation. The simulation reveals that this novel approach can reflect the variation of safety information quantity of each node in the complex network, and the scale-free network has better "radiation explosive power", while the small-world network has better "radiation staying power". The results also show that it is efficient to improve the overall performance of network security by selecting nodes with high degrees as the information source, refining and simplifying the information, increasing the information second reception capacity and decreasing the noises. In a word, this article lays the foundation for further research on the interactions of information and energy between internal components within complex systems.}}

In this pursuit, we introduce a metric called the assortativity weight of an edge, defined as the product of the number of uncovered adjacent edges and the absolute value of the difference in the weights of the end vertices. The MAM algorithm prefers to include edges that have the smallest assortativity weight in each iteration (one edge per iteration) until all edges are covered. The MAM algorithm can also be adapted to determine a maximal dissortative matching (MDM) to maximize the dissimilarity between the end vertices that are part of a matching as well as to determine a maximal node matching (MNM) that simply maximizes the number of vertices that are part of the matching. We run the MAM, MNM and MDM algorithms on real-world network graphs as well as on the theoretical model-based random network graphs and scale-free network graphs and analyze the tradeoffs between the % of node matches and assortativity index (targeted optimal values: 1 for MAM and −1 for MDM).}}

abstract = {Abstract Multiple line outages (MLOs) are common in blackouts, the detection of MLOs are very important for the robusty and securety of power grid. Many insightful methods have been reported to handle with line outage detection, but few of them focus on the detection of MLOs that happen in a short period of time. To deal with this promblem, based on the complex network theory, some novel algorithms are developed by using phasor measurement units (PMUs) information. By invoking virtual adaptive observers, the presented algorithms monitor the connectivity status between buses, which make the algorithms tolerant to the interaction effects between the multiple line outages. Besides, the proposed algorithms also address the reconstruction of the real-time adjacency matrix of the power transmission networks. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithms.}}

We applied the NCON model to different topological networks and studied the formation of opinion clusters. In the case of random graphs, random regular networks, and scale-free (SF) networks, we found that the system moved from a continuous phase transition to a discontinuous phase transition as the connectivity density and exponent of the SF network λ ​decreased and increased in the steady state, respectively. Moreover, the initial proportions of neutral opinions were found to have little effect on the proportional structure of opinions at the steady state. These results suggest that the majority choice between positive and negative opinions depends on the initial proportion of each opinion. The NCON model may have potential applications for decision makers.}}

As per the multiple origin spreaders, the K-Shell method fails to yield similar results when compared to the degree centrality. Current research proposes a Pareto-Shell Decomposition. It employs Pareto front function. It's Pareto optimal set comprises non-dominated spreads, with the ratio of high out-degree to in-degree and high in-degree.

Every node tries to transmit the epidemic to its neighbors after the waiting time. Moreover, by using the mean-field theory and numerical simulations, it is discovered that the epidemic threshold is correlated to the network topology and the distribution of the waiting time. Furthermore, our results reveal that an optimal distribution of the heterogeneous waiting time can suppress the epidemic spreading.}}

One of the major problems related to SNP sets is the large p, small n problem which refers to the high number of features and the small number of samples, which makes the classification task complex. In this paper, a new hybrid intelligent technique based on Association Rule Mining (ARM) and Neural Networks (NN) which uses Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) is proposed to deal with the dimensionality problem. On the one hand, ARM optimized by Grammatical Evolution (GE) is used to select the most informative features and to reduce the dimensionality by parallel extraction of associations between SNPs in two separate datasets of case and control samples. On the other hand, and to complement the previous task, a NN is used for efficient classification. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for setting up the parameters of the two combined techniques. The proposed GA-NN-GEARM approach has been applied on four different SNP datasets obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website. The created model has reached a high classification accuracy, reaching in some cases 100%, and has outperformed several feature selection techniques when combined with different classifiers.}}

Due to occurrence of uncertainties in coupling strengths, the considered CDNs take account of an uncertain inner coupling strength which is more general than the previously existing inner coupling strengths. Specifically, the uncertainties encountering in coupling terms are characterized with the aid of interval matrix approach. Also, by introducing a simple linear transformation, the corresponding error system is formulated. Then, based on the information about control delay term, two cases are considered namely, differentiable and non-differentiable. More precisely, by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) containing triple integral terms in respect of Kronecker product, for both the cases, some sufficient criteria are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee the robust synchronization of the addressed CDNs based on passivity property. And the established criteria optimistically reduce the L 2 gain level from the disturbance to the output vector. Subsequently, the desired state feedback gain matrix is designed in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.}}

Firstly, an index called Community Intimacy (CI) is presented to measure the adjacency relationship between the communities, based on which a community ordering algorithm is introduced. According to the proposed Community-Sector hypothesis, which supposes that most nodes of one community gather in a same sector in hyperbolic space, CHM maps the ordered communities into hyperbolic space, and then the angular coordinates of nodes are randomly initialized within the sector that they belong to. Therefore, all the network nodes are so far mapped to hyperbolic space, and then the initialized angular coordinates can be optimized by employing the information of all nodes, which can greatly improve the algorithm precision. By applying the proposed dual-layer angle sampling method in the optimization procedure, CHM reduces the time complexity to O ( n 2 ) . The experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}}

One of the tools that has increased in importance in the understanding of problems related to this area are complex networks. This tool merges graph theory and statistical methods for modeling important problems. In several research fields, complex networks are studied from the various points of view, such as: topology of networks, extraction of physical features and statistics, specific applications, comparison of metrics and study of physical phenomena. Linguistic is one area that has received great attention, particularly due to its close relationship with issues arising from the emergence of large text databases. Thus, many studies have emerged for modeling of complex networks in this area, increasing the demand for efficient algorithms for feature extraction, network dynamic observation and comparison of behavior for different types of languages. Some works for specific languages such as English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Russian and Arabic, have discussed the semantic aspects of these languages. On the other hand, as an important feature of a network we can highlight the computation of average clustering coefficient. This measure has a physical impact on the network topology studies and consequently on the conclusions about the semantics of a language. However its computational time is of O(n3), making its computing prohibitive for large current databases. This paper presents as main contribution a modeling of two complex networks: the first one, in English, is constructed from a specific medical database; the second, in Portuguese, from a journalistic manually annotated database. Our paper then presents the study of the dynamics of these two networks. We show their small-world behavior and the influence of hubs, suggesting that these databases have a high degree of Modularity, indicating specific contexts of words. Also, a method for efficient clustering coefficient computation is presented, and can be applied to large current databases. Other features such as fraction of reciprocal connections and average connection density are also calculated and discussed for both networks.}}

The first provides a general summary of the fracture network through the description of the number of nodes, edges, diameter, radius, lengths and clustering coefficients. A second group of features centers on the description of communicability in the network by means of three indexes recently proposed. In addition, we apply centrality measures (betweenness, closeness, eigenvector and eccentricity) for quantifying the importance of nodes in the entire network. Finally, we identify a topology for fracture networks using a classification based on the degree of communicability. The most important results obtained in this work are focused in the topological characteristic patterns found in fracture networks applying the approach of complex networks that in general provide local and global parameters of connectivity and communicability.}}

Using ROV, we construct a source estimator for tree graph and generalize it to arbitrary graph. Based on the generalized estimator, a novel Propagation Centrality (PC) algorithm is proposed, which could locate the propagation source on arbitrary graph with complexity O(N3). With PC algorithm, source location is converted into finding out a Breadth-First-Search (BFS) spanning tree with the maximal ROV from infected graph. We perform extensive simulations on a series of synthetic and real networks, the results show that PC performs better than other 5 existing methods. More importantly, the results also show that PC performs stable on the infected graph with sparse observation phenomenon.}}

In this framework, a pseudo-dual graph transformation of the grain contact network produces a graph of pores which can be readily interpreted as a pore space network. Survivability, a new metric succinctly summarizing the connectivity of the solid grain and pore space networks, measures material robustness. The size distribution and the connectivity of pores can be characterized quantitatively through various network properties. Assortativity characterizes the pore space with respect to the parity of the number of particles enclosing the pore. Multiscale clusters of odd parity versus even parity contact cycles alternate spatially along the shear band: these represent, respectively, local jamming and unjamming regions that continually switch positions in time throughout the failure regime. Optimal paths, established using network shortest paths in favor of large pores, provide clues on preferential paths for interstitial matter transport. In systems with higher rolling resistance at contacts, less tortuous shortest paths thread through larger pores in shear bands. Notably the structural patterns uncovered in the pore space suggest that more robust models of interstitial pore flow through deforming granular systems require a proper consideration of the evolution of in situ shear band and fracture patterns – not just globally, but also inside these localized failure zones.}}

Specifically, we show, both analytically and numerically, the degree distribution of the line graph of an Erdős–Rényi graph follows the same distribution as its original graph. We derive a formula for the assortativity of line graphs and indicate that the assortativity of a line graph is not linearly related to its original graph. Additionally, line graphs of various graphs, e.g. Erdős–Rényi graphs, scale-free graphs, show positive assortativity.

abstract = {Abstract We propose an improved mean-field model to investigate immunization strategies of an SIS model in complex networks. Unlike the traditional mean-field approach, the improved model utilizes the degree information of before and after the immunization. The epidemic threshold of degree-correlated networks can be obtained by linear stability analysis. For degree-uncorrelated networks, the model is reduced to the SIS epidemic model in networks after removing the immunized nodes. Compared to the previous results of random and targeted immunization schemes on degree-uncorrelated networks, we find that the infectious disease has a lower epidemic threshold.}}

This data set is exclusive in its kind because around 80% of Estonia's bank transactions are done through Swedbank; hence, the economic structure of the country can be reconstructed. Scale-free networks are commonly observed in a wide array of different contexts such as nature and society. In this paper, the nodes are comprised by customers of the bank (legal entities) and the links are established by payments between these nodes. We study the scaling-free and structural properties of this network. We also describe its topology, components and behaviors. We show that this network shares typical structural characteristics known in other complex networks: degree distributions follow a power law, low clustering coefficient and low average shortest path length. We identify the key nodes of the network and perform simulations of resiliency against random and targeted attacks of the nodes with two different approaches. With this, we find that by identifying and studying the links between the nodes is possible to perform vulnerability analysis of the Estonian economy with respect to economic shocks.}}

Although various centrality measures have been proposed to address this problem, such as degree, betweenness, and closeness centralities, they all have some limitations. Recently, technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), as a tradeoff between the existing metrics, has been proposed to rank nodes effectively and efficiently. It regards the centrality measures as the multi-attribute of the complex network and connects the multi-attribute to synthesize the evaluation of node importance of each node. However, each attribute plays an equally important part in this method, which is not reasonable. In this paper, we improve the method to ranking the node's spreading ability. A new method, named as weighted technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (weighted TOPSIS) is proposed. In our method, we not only consider different centrality measures as the multi-attribute to the network, but also propose a new algorithm to calculate the weight of each attribute. To evaluate the performance of our method, we use the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model to do the simulation on four real networks. The experiments on four real networks show that the proposed method can rank the spreading ability of nodes more accurately than the original method.}}

By modeling the switching of network topologies as a Markov process, a novel event-triggered synchronization strategy is proposed.

Under this strategy, the synchronization problem of complex network is equivalently converted to the stability of a class of Markovian jump systems with a time-varying delay. By using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method and the weak infinitesimal operation, a sufficient condition for the mean square synchronization of the complex networks subject to Markovian switching topologies is established. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.}}

By the self-loop strategy, one can easily control the definition of modularity, and the resulting modularity can be optimized by using the existing modularity optimization algorithms. The local modularity is used as the target function for community detection, and a self-consistent method is proposed for the optimization of the local modularity. We analyze the behaviors of the local modularity and show the validity of the local modularity in detecting community structures on various networks.}}

In this study, we propose a new MCL method based on the firefly algorithm (FA) to identify protein complexes from DPIN. Based on three-sigma principle, we construct the DPIN and discuss an overall modeling process. In order to optimize parameters, we exploit a number of population-based optimization methods. A thorough comparison completed for different swarm optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and firefly algorithm (FA) has been carried out. The identified protein complexes on the DIP dataset show that the new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy of protein complex identification.}}

We introduce the theory of complex networks and find similarities between AEOS redundant targets scheduling problem and the node centrality ranking problem. Then we model this problem as a complex network, regarding each node as a possible observation opportunity, and define two factors, node importance factor and target importance factor, to describe the node/target importance. Based on the two factors, we propose a fast approximate scheduling algorithm (FASA) to obtain the effective scheduling results. Simulation results indicate the FASA is quite efficient and with broad suitability. Our work is helpful in the EOSs and AEOSs scheduling problems by using complex network knowledge.}}

Stability analysis shows that the onset of Hopf bifurcation can be delayed or advanced via a PD controller by setting proper control parameters. Therefore the Hopf bifurcation of the model became controllable to achieve desirable behaviors which is applicable in certain circumstances.

By using the Riccati-like difference equations approach, the estimator parameter is characterized by the solutions to two Riccati-like difference equations. It is shown that the obtained upper bound is minimized by the designed estimator parameters and the proposed state estimation algorithm is of a recursive form suitable for online computation. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed state estimation scheme.}}

Based on complex network theory, we built a global fossil energy exergy flow network with countries as nodes, the international exergy flows as edges and the exergy of each flow as the weight of the edges. We analyzed the distribution of countries, the overall structure, major countries and major exergy flow paths of the network from 1996 to 2012. The results show that even if the fossil energy trade becomes more frequent and larger, there are always a few trade relationships and countries that play critical roles in the fossil energy trade. The trade relationship intensity at the global level is relatively lower than the corresponding intensity at the regional level. There are four main fossil energy trade groups, and these groups have the Russian Federation, the United States, Japan and Saudi Arabia as their core countries. If an energy war, an energy crisis or other problems occur in the countries with more partners, their impacts are likely to spread to other countries and even affect the global fossil energy trade.}}

To date, fMRI studies investigating the neural underpinning of dual-task interference have mostly relied on local brain activation maps or static brain connectivity networks. Here, based on task fMRI we explored how fluctuations in behavior during concurrent performance of a visuospatial and a speech task relate to alternations in the topology of dynamic brain connectivity networks. We combined a time-resolved functional connectivity and complex network analysis with a sliding window approach applied to the trial by trial behavioral responses to investigate the coupling between dynamic brain networks and dual-task behavior at close temporal proximity. Participants showed fluctuations in their dual-task behavior over time, with the accuracy in the component tasks being statistically independent from one another. On the global level of brain networks we found that dynamic changes of network topology were differentially coupled with the behavior in each component task during the course of dual-tasking. While momentary decrease in the global efficiency of dynamic brain networks correlated with subsequent increase in visuospatial accuracy, better speech performance was preceded by higher global network efficiency and was followed by an increase in between-module connectivity over time. Additionally, dynamic alternations in the modular organization of brain networks at the posterior cingulate cortex were differentially predictive for the visuospatial as compared to the speech accuracy over time. Our results provide the first evidence that, during the course of dual-tasking, each component task is supported by a distinct topological configuration of brain connectivity networks. This finding suggests that the failure of functional brain connectivity networks to adapt to an optimal topology supporting the performance in both component tasks at the same time contributes to the moment to moment fluctuations in dual-task behavior.}}

Secondly, a measurement considering the effective paths number is proposed to evaluate freeway network's connective reliability. Finally, based on the freeway network in Shandong Province (SFN), which is the largest scale freeway network in eastern China, those evaluation indicators are calculated, and the freeway network's connective reliability are evaluated under different scenarios. The nodes with high structural betweenness must be given more protection so as to improve the reliability of the SFN under random attack The structural properties and reliability analysis of freeway networks are helpful for road planning and unexpected major events control.}}

The hidden source can be localized based on the information gathered by a few nodes, which are called the observers. Identification of the efficient observers is critical to locate the source with high accuracy. Here we analyze several placement strategies of the observers based on centralities of nodes, including the high-degree, high-betweenness, high-clustering coefficient, high-eigenvector and high-closeness. Based on the random spreading experiments on both model and real networks, we find that the localization accuracy of these strategies is decreased with the increase of the connectivity of network, and there is no significant difference between them. Further experiments show that the coverage range of the observers may be the key factor that affects the localization accuracy. Our results can provide a route for the optimal design of placement strategies of the observer nodes.}}

Some features could be extracted from node labels and other kinds of priori knowledge. But how to perform the feature classification without priori knowledge is a challenge. This paper addresses the key problem: how do we conduct role extraction in networks with only edge connections known? On the basis of behavior differences in dynamics, nodes are classified into three role groups: Leaders(L), Communicators(C) and Members(M). Unlike traditional community detections, we detect overlapping communities by link clustering first and then classify nodes according to the community entropy, which describes the disorder of how many different communities a node connects to. We propose a time saving and unsupervised learning approach for automatically discovering nodes' roles based solely on network topology. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on six real-world networks through pinning control. By controlling communicator nodes, the controllability is enhanced and the cost for control is reduced obviously in networks with strong community structure.}}

In this study, a new complex classifier-based approach is presented for automatic sleep scoring using EEG signals. In this context, complex-valued methods were utilized in the feature selection and classification stages. In the feature selection stage, features of EEG data were extracted with the help of a dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). In the next phase, five statistical features were obtained. These features are classified using complex-valued neural network (CVANN) algorithm. The Taguchi method was used in order to determine the effective parameter values in this CVANN. The aim was to develop a stable model involving parameter optimization. Different statistical parameters were utilized in the evaluation phase. Also, results were obtained in terms of two different sleep standards. In the study in which a 2nd level DTCWT and CVANN hybrid model was used, 93.84% accuracy rate was obtained according to the Rechtschaffen &amp; Kales (R&amp;K) standard, while a 95.42% accuracy rate was obtained according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard.

As productivity of conventional energy resources decreases and the proportion of reserves in unconventional oil/gas increases, the theoretical method about the modeling and simulation of complex fracture network propagation needs to be improved to innovate stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) fracturing technology. To simulate the fracture network growth, a new model based on the modified displacement discontinuity method (MDDM) coupling pseudo-3D fracture propagation model is proposed introducing the propagation pattern and criterion. The numerical result of this model is solved and the process of fracture network propagation is simulated in different natural fracture (NF) distribution and fracturing parameters. The effects of NF distribution, hydraulic fracture (HF) spacing, bottomhole pressure and segmented and multi-cluster fracturing mode on the fracture network propagation are discussed. The simulation results of complex fracture network are characterized by four parameters as well. The results show that there are reasonable fracturing parameters technically during the SRV fracturing in unconventional shale reservoirs. It is significant to reasonably and efficiently develop the unconventional shale resources by researching the fracture network propagation rules.}}

By constructing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and using matrix inequality technique, a delay-dependent condition to assure the global exponential stability for the considered neural networks is established. The condition is expressed in complex-valued linear matrix inequality, which can be checked numerically using the effective YALMIP toolbox in MATLAB. An example with simulations is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained result.}}

abstract = {Abstract Studies of patients with brain damage have highlighted a broad neural network of limbic and prefrontal areas as important for adaptive decision-making. However, some patients with damage outside these regions have impaired decision-making behavior, and the behavioral impairments observed in these cases are often attributed to the general variability in behavior following brain damage, rather than a deficit in a specific brain–behavior relationship. A novel approach, lesion-derived network mapping, uses healthy subject resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) data to infer the areas that would be connected with each patient's lesion area in healthy adults. Here, we used this approach to investigate whether there was a systematic pattern of connectivity associated with decision-making performance in patients with focal damage in areas not classically associated with decision-making. These patients were categorized a priori into "impaired" or "unimpaired" groups based on their performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Lesion-derived network maps based on the impaired patients showed overlap in somatosensory, motor and insula cortices, to a greater extent than patients who showed unimpaired IGT performance. Akin to the classic concept of "diaschisis" (von Monakow, 1914), this focus on the remote effects that focal damage can have on large-scale distributed brain networks has the potential to inform not only differences in decision-making behavior, but also other cognitive functions or neurological syndromes where a distinct phenotype has eluded neuroanatomical classification and brain–behavior relationships appear highly heterogeneous.}}

To investigate the effects of interactions between two rumors under symmetric conditions, we built a model based on an ordinary differential equation system while assuming that each individual's spreading rate after receiving one rumor depends on whether he/she knows the other rumor. In certain cases, two rumors accelerate the spread of each other, while in a portion of the other cases they impede or decelerate the spread of each other. We discuss these effects by dividing the total population into nine groups that correspond to nine states, and we subsequently build the mean-field equations for the two-rumor interaction based on the SIR model in a homogeneous complex network, and we find their numerical solution with varying interaction factors for the rates of spreading and becoming disinterested. The results show that when we change these interaction factors, the density curves of the nine states and their maximum values will change accordingly by a series of rules, which demonstrates the corresponding effects when there is a positive or negative interaction between the two rumors. Our work could establish a foundation for further study of this issue.}}

This is an advancement over origin-destination matrices, since freight vehicles are studied at a disaggregate level. Digicore Fleet Management has provided GPS data of over 40,000 freight vehicles travelling in South Africa over a six month period, from which freight activity chains can be extracted. The first contribution of this paper is to generate synthetic freight activity chains using a complex network that captures the connectivity between firms where freight activities take place, and therefore also captures some aspect of the behaviour of the vehicles. The complex network is built with the activity chains of 60% randomly selected freight vehicles, called the training set. 10 synthetic populations are generated using this complex network, each representing a 10% sample of the total freight population in South Africa. As a second contribution, we use the observed activity chains of the remaining 40% of vehicles, called the test set, to compare to the synthesised activity chains. The results indicate that the complex network approach of generating synthetic populations correctly estimates the fraction of activity chains for different chain lengths. The chain start times of the synthetic populations are generally similar to that of the observed activity chains, except for some underestimation during the morning peak hours. Vehicle kilometres travelled are only slightly overestimated in the synthetic activity chains. This complex network approach to generating synthetic freight populations is novel, and the results indicate that the synthetic populations generated are an accurate representation of South Africa's freight population.}}

The planning model focuses primarily on integrating the quantitative and qualitative risk factors associated with strategic production network planning. Integration was realized by linking a robust programming model with aspects of multi-target optimization using an EPSILON-constraint approach. This allows quantitative risks such as fluctuations in demand, exchange rates, and transportation costs to be factored into a common mixed-integer optimization model as discrete scenarios, with qualitative risks, e.g., security risks, accounted for as part of a points-based evaluation approach. The developed model minimizes the firm's expected downside risk exposure while meeting a pre-selected threshold level for environmental risks. The trade-off between risk and profit is depicted and interpreted using a Pareto analysis. The developed model makes it possible to characterize a variety of risks that are very difficult to manage when carrying out strategic planning of production networks in practice.}}

For this purpose production systems are modeled as complex networks, in which nodes represent machines and edges represent the material flow between them.

The analysis relies on a large quality-controlled data set consisting of 699 daily time series recorded in the continental United States (CONUS) that are not affected by human activity and primarily reflects meteorological conditions. DHVGs allow a clear visualization and quantification of time irreversibility of flow dynamics, which can be interpreted as a signature of nonlinearity, and long range dependence resulting from the interaction of atmospheric, surface and underground processes acting at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Irreversibility is explored by mapping the time series into ingoing, outgoing, and undirected graphs and comparing the corresponding degree distributions. Using surrogate data preserving up to the second order linear temporal dependence properties of the observed series, DHVGs highlight the additional complexity introduced by nonlinearity into flow fluctuation dynamics. We show that the degree distributions do not decay exponentially as expected, but tend to follow a subexponential behavior, even though sampling uncertainty does not allow a clear distinction between apparent or true power law decay. These results confirm that the complexity of stream flow dynamics goes beyond a linear representation involving for instance the combination of linear processes with short and long range dependence, and requires modeling strategies accounting for temporal asymmetry and nonlinearity.}}

The local dimension of node characters the local property of pixel. It is observed that edge pixels obviously have lower node dimension than non-edge pixels, which is used in our proposed edge detection method.

In the present study, this concept is outlined through the kinetic model of numerous parallel and serial reactions that proceed via a two-step benzazepine heterocyclic compound synthesis, introducing 1-(2-bromoethyl)-4-chlorobenzene (4CEBr) and allylamine (AA) as first step reactants, N-(4-chlorophenethyl)prop-2-en-1-aminium chloride (4CPAL) as intermediate (second step reactant), and (1R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (lorcaserin) as the desired product, with the second step heterogeneously/homogeneously (negligible mass transfer resistance) catalysed by AlCl3 as Lewis acid. In addition to these, a plethora of by-products, formed through various mechanisms ranging from eliminations, nucleophilic and electrophilic substitutions and additions, Friedel–Crafts reactions and others, was identified and quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (HPLC–MS) and gas chromatography. A large set of experiments was executed for both the first and second step, varying temperature (20–60 °C for the first and 100–120 °C for the second step), reactant and catalyst concentrations, as well as the presence of the first-step reactant (4CEBr and AA) in the second, whereas the stepwise multi-regression modelling with consequent sensitivity analysis ensued. Model optimization indicated that conversions as high as 91% may be achieved in the second step; nonetheless, that a trade-off between yield and productivity has to be considered. An efficient optimization of synthesis steps facilitates further downstream separation, as well as streamlines process intensification when proceeding to the crystallization of API polymorph.}}

Protein interaction network analyses have successfully improved our understanding of both single gene diseases (Mendelian diseases) and complex diseases. Whether the mRNAs downstream of complex disease genes are central or peripheral in the genetic information flow relating DNA to mRNA remains unclear and may be disease-specific. Using expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) that provide DNA to mRNA associations and network centrality metrics, we hypothesize that we can unveil the systems properties of information flow between SNPs and the transcriptomes of complex diseases. We compare different conditions such as naïve SNP assignments and stringent linkage disequilibrium (LD) free assignments for transcripts to remove confounders from LD. Additionally, we compare the results from eQTL networks between lymphoblastoid cell lines and liver tissue. Empirical permutation resampling (p &lt; 0.001) and theoretic Mann–Whitney U test (p &lt; 10−30) statistics indicate that mRNAs corresponding to complex disease SNPs via eQTL associations are likely to be regulated by a larger number of SNPs than expected. We name this novel property mRNA hubness in eQTL networks, and further term mRNAs with high hubness as master integrators. mRNA master integrators receive and coordinate the perturbation signals from large numbers of polymorphisms and respond to the personal genetic architecture integratively. This genetic signal integration contrasts with the mechanism underlying some Mendelian diseases, where a genetic polymorphism affecting a single protein hub produces a divergent signal that affects a large number of downstream proteins. Indeed, we verify that this property is independent of the hubness in protein networks for which these mRNAs are transcribed. Our findings provide novel insights into the pleiotropy of mRNAs targeted by complex disease polymorphisms and the architecture of the information flow between the genetic polymorphisms and transcriptomes of complex diseases.}}

abstract = {Abstract Modeling software systems using complex networks can be an effective technique for analyzing the complexity of software systems. To enhance the technique, the structure of a complex network can be extended by assigning a weight to the edges of the complex network to denote the strength of communicational cohesion between a pair of related software components. This paper proposes an approach to represent an object-oriented software system using a weighted complex network in order to capture its structural characteristics, with respect to its maintainability and reliability. Nodes and edges are modeled based on the complexities of classes and their dependencies. Graph theory metrics are applied onto the transformed network with the purpose to evaluate the software system. Comparative analysis is performed using 40 object-oriented software systems, with different levels of maintenance effort. We found that common statistical patterns from the software systems can be identified easily. It is when these software systems are grouped and compared based on their levels of maintenance effort that their statistical patterns are more distinguishable to represent some common behavior and structural complexity of object-oriented software. The evaluations indicate that the proposed approach is capable of identifying software components that violate common software design principles.}}

A simple pinning control strategy is proposed and some sufficient criteria to realize cluster synchronization with both static and adaptive control strength are given.

From this viewpoint, it is desirable that cities are planned through energy models able to achieve the efficiency in the use of sources and able to minimize GHG emissions. Hence, considering the modern cities as complex systems, the high variability of the energy demand is taken into account evaluating the dynamic evolution of the energy flows. Thus, this paper presents the development, evaluation and application of a flexible mathematical procedure able to characterize the energy profile of an urban area and its dynamic evolution through the implementation of the network theory. The obtained results allow proper scenario analysis for the definition of energy planning strategies focused on the promotion and installation of cogeneration systems and in favor of renewable sources.}}

In order to efficiently analyze froth image, froth texture is used to accurately and rapidly extract froth characteristics based on the statistics of image pixels. The characterization and identification of texture require a method that can express the context surrounding each pixel by combining local and global texture characteristics. To extract the distinctive froth texture features in different production states, a novel complex networks-based texture extraction and classification method for froth imaging is proposed in this paper. A network model is constructed by expressing pixels as network nodes and similarities between pixels as network links. This method automatically sets the optimal algorithm parameters for the complex network modeling of the froth images according to bubble sizes by using the Minkowski distance. Energy and entropy measurements are used to quantify the properties of the connectivity and topology of the froth-image network model. Copper froth images at different production states extracted from the flotation monitoring system in a flotation plant are used to test the froth-image network model. The experimental results show that the proposed method accurately describes the froth image texture and also robustly classifies the different production states.}}

The results show that the dominant evolution cycle of the market integration from the stable stage to the high shock stage is time-varying, featuring the weekly → weekly → short yearly → short quarterly → short monthly cycle, and the dominant evolution cycle of the market diversification is also time-varying, characterized by the short monthly → weekly → long yearly → weekly → weekly cycle. These findings provide a clearer reference decision-making cycle for decision makers to create a more efficient period-oriented strategy. Two larger stable homogeneous groups of regional oil markets and the dominant regional markets in the process of the market evolution are discovered, providing more details regarding the target monitoring regional market for the oil-related early warning strategy and hedging strategies.}}

However, many more characteristics can also be considered such as graph similarity, centrality, or flow properties. These properties have been utilized as feedback for algorithms whose goal is to ascertain plausible network models (also called generators) for a given network. However, a good set of network measures to employ that can be said to sufficiently capture network structure is not yet known. In this paper we provide an investigation into this question through a meta-analysis that quantifies the ability of a subset of measures to appropriately compare model (dis)similarity. The results are utilized as fitness measures for improving a recently proposed genetic programming (GP) framework that is capable of ascertaining a plausible network model from a single network observation. It is shown that the candidate model evaluation criteria of the GP system to automatically infer existing (man-made) network models, in addition to real-world networks, is improved.}}

The overall topological structures and functional features of a public transportation network, therefore, must be fully understood to assist the safety management of rail transit and planning for sustainable development. Based on the complex network theory, this study took the Beijing Subway system (BSS) as an example to assess the robustness of a subway network in face of random failures (RFs) as well as malicious attacks (MAs). Specifically, (1) the topological properties of the rail transit system were quantitatively analyzed by means of a mathematical statistical model; (2) a new weighted composite index was developed and proved to be valid for evaluation of node importance, which could be utilized to position hub stations in a subway network; (3) a simulation analysis was conducted to examine the variations in the network performance as well as the dynamic characteristics of system response in face of different disruptions. The results reveal that the BSS exhibits typical characteristics of a scale-free network, with relatively high survivability and robustness when faced with RFs, whereas error tolerance is relatively low when the hubs undergo MAs. In addition, illustrations of dynamic variations in the influence of the BSS under a series of MAs were provided by spatial analysis techniques of Geographical Information System (GIS), which directly verified the earlier conclusions. We believed the proposed methodology and the results obtained could contribute to a baseline for relevant research of transportation topological robustness.}}

When the network grows to some certain size, we introduce an SIR-like disease such as pandemic influenza H1N1/09 to the population. Due to its rapid spread, the population size changes slowly, and thus the disease spreads on correlated networks with approximately fixed size. To predict the disease evolution on correlated networks, we first review two node-based SIR models incorporating degree correlations and an edge-based SIR model without considering degree correlation, and then compare the predictions of these models with stochastic SIR simulations, respectively. We find that the edge-based model, even without considering degree correlations, agrees much better than the node-based models incorporating degree correlations with stochastic SIR simulations in many respects. Moreover, simulation results show that for networks with positive correlation, the edge-based model provides a better upper bound of the cumulative incidence than the node-based SIR models, whereas for networks with negative correlation, it provides a lower bound of the cumulative incidence.}}

In order to detect communities more accurately and reasonably, a novel algorithm is proposed based on cosine distance and core-node in this paper. Cosine distances between nodes are regarded as their similarity measure and network node vectors can be extracted directly from the similarity matrix without calculating eigenvectors. Core-nodes as the initial communities are found by cosine distance threshold and degree threshold. Furthermore, the initial communities are expanded by adding other nodes with the nearest cosine distance to core-nodes. Through changing degree and cosine distance thresholds constantly, the optimal community structure of complex networks can be obtained by optimizing modularity with high accuracy. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}}

However, it may suffer from a bad choice of initial seeds (also called centers) that seriously affect the clustering accuracy and the convergence rate. Additionally, in K-means, the number of communities should be specified in advance. Till now, it is still an open problem on how to select initial seeds and how to determine the number of communities. In this study, a new parameter-free community detection method (named K-rank-D) was proposed. First, based on the fact that good initial seeds usually have high importance and are dispersedly located in a network, we proposed a modified PageRank centrality to evaluate the importance of a node, and drew a decision graph to depict the importance and the dispersion of nodes. Then, the initial seeds and the number of communities were selected from the decision graph actively and intuitively as the ‘start' parameter of K-means. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over competing methods for community detection.}}

abstract = {Abstract The last decade witnessed a great development of the structural and dynamic study of complex systems described as a network of elements. Therefore, systems can be described as a set of, possibly, heterogeneous entities or agents (the network nodes) interacting in, possibly, different ways (defining the network edges). In this context, it is of practical interest to model and handle not only static and homogeneous networks but also dynamic, heterogeneous ones. Depending on the size and type of the problem, these networks may require different computational approaches involving sequential, parallel or distributed systems with or without the use of disk-based data structures. In this work, we develop an Application Programming Interface (APINetworks) for the modeling and treatment of general networks in arbitrary computational environments. To minimize dependency between components, we decouple the network structure from its function using different packages for grouping sets of related tasks. The structural package, the one in charge of building and handling the network structure, is the core element of the system. In this work, we focus in this API structural component. We apply an object-oriented approach that makes use of inheritance and polymorphism. In this way, we can model static and dynamic networks with heterogeneous elements in the nodes and heterogeneous interactions in the edges. In addition, this approach permits a unified treatment of different computational environments. Tests performed on a C++11 version of the structural package show that, on current standard computers, the system can handle, in main memory, directed and undirected linear networks formed by tens of millions of nodes and edges. Our results compare favorably to those of existing tools.

Nature of problem: The computational modeling and handling of complex systems, described as a network of interacting elements, is nowadays a topic of paramount importance. In the general case, it is necessary to represent static or dynamic, time dependent, sets of heterogeneous entities related through heterogeneous interactions. In turn, and depending on the size and nature of the problem, different computational approaches may be required. Thus, we can resort to sequential, parallel or distributed systems and to disk-based data structures. Different tools are available that satisfy one or several of these requirements. However, a unified approach for dealing with heterogeneous networks in arbitrary computational environments is still pending. Solution method: To address the above issues, we have developed an Application Programming Interface: APINetworks. The API is organized in several packages where the one responsible for the network structure acts as the core element. We resort to an object-oriented approach, that makes use of inheritance and polymorphism. In this way, we can model static and dynamic networks and include heterogeneous agents in the nodes and heterogeneous interactions in the edges. In addition, this approach permits a unified treatment, transparent to the user, of different computational environments: sequential, parallel, distributed, memory-based or disk-based.

We derive mean-field equations to characterize the dynamics of SEIR model on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Then a steady-state analysis is conducted to investigate the spreading threshold and the final rumor size. Simulations on both artificial and real networks show that a decrease of fuzziness can effectively increase the spreading threshold of the SEIR model and reduce the maximum rumor influence. In addition, the spreading threshold is independent of the attractiveness of rumor. Simulation results also show that the speed of rumor spreading obeys the relation "BA network &gt; WS network", whereas the final scale of spreading obeys the opposite relation.}}

One of the characteristics of the ULRs is high production declining rate, and thus enhanced oil recovery techniques such as Huff-n-Puff will ensue. In addition, the existence of complex fracture network has been proven by both field and simulation work. This study investigated the potential of CO2 huff-n-puff in ULRs with complex fracture networks. Two fracture characterization techniques for complex fracture network such as fractal-based, and microseismic-based were applied to reduce uncertainties of fracture networks and thus improve the accuracy of simulation input. In order to study complex CO2 recovery mechanism, lab-measured data was upscaled to the field-scale, and then used for evaluating production performance of a simple fracture network. Detailed sensitivity analysis showed that diffusion in the field scale is negligible compared with other recovery mechanisms such as oil swelling, gas expansion, viscosity reduction, etc. The following comparison between dual continuum and the explicit fracture modeling approaches highlights the importance of heterogeneity due to the explicit fractures. Dual continuum models yields less accurate pressure behavior than explicit discrete fracture models even though production behavior could be history matched.}}

In the beginning, the algorithm detects local communities; then through iterations and local neighborhood ratio function, final communities are detected by merging close related local communities. Analysis of simulation results on real and artificial networks shows the proposed algorithm detects well defined communities in both networks by wide margin.}}

Existing computational methods to detect protein complexes are usually based on specific network topological properties of PPI networks. However, due to the inherent complexity of the network structures, the identification of protein complexes may not be fully addressed by using single network topological property. In this study, we propose a novel MultiObjective Evolutionary Programming Genetic Algorithm (MOEPGA) which integrates multiple network topological features to detect biologically meaningful protein complexes. Our approach first systematically analyzes the multiobjective problem in terms of identifying protein complexes from PPI networks, and then constructs the objective function of the iterative algorithm based on three common topological properties of protein complexes from the benchmark dataset, finally we describe our algorithm, which mainly consists of three steps, population initialization, subgraph mutation and subgraph selection operation. To show the utility of our method, we compared MOEPGA with several state-of-the-art algorithms on two yeast PPI datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only find more protein complexes but also achieve higher accuracy in terms of fscore. Moreover, our approach can cover a certain number of proteins in the input PPI network in terms of the normalized clustering score. Taken together, our method can serve as a powerful framework to detect protein complexes in yeast PPI networks, thereby facilitating the identification of the underlying biological functions.}}

In particular, the model considers the linear combination of three possible routes of disease propagation between infected and susceptible individuals as well as two possible transmission types which describe how the susceptible vectors attack the infected individuals. A new technique based on the basic reproduction matrix is introduced to obtain the following results. First, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the global stability of the model through a unified approach. As a result, we are able to produce the exact basic reproduction number and the precise epidemic thresholds with respect to three spreading strengths, the curing strength or the immunization strength all at once. Second, the monotonicity of the basic reproduction number and the above mentioned epidemic thresholds with respect to all other parameters can be rigorously characterized. Finally, we are able to compare the effectiveness of various immunization strategies under the assumption that the number of persons getting vaccinated is the same for all strategies. In particular, we prove that in the scale-free networks, both targeted and acquaintance immunizations are more effective than uniform and active immunizations and that active immunization is the least effective strategy among those four. We are also able to determine how the vaccine should be used at minimum to control the outbreak of the disease.}}

Link prediction techniques based on heat and mass diffusion processes are employed to obtain predictions for products exported in the future. These baseline predictions are improved using a recent metric of country fitness and product similarity. The overall best results are achieved with a newly developed metric of product similarity which takes advantage of causality in the network evolution.}}

There are a number of measures proposed for this purpose, for instance, high-degree centrality measure reflects the importance of the network topology and has a reasonable runtime performance to find a set of nodes with highest degree, but they do not have a satisfactory dissemination potentiality in the network due to having many common neighbors ( CN ( 1 ) ) and common neighbors of neighbors ( CN ( 2 ) ). This flaw holds in other measures as well. In this paper, we compare high-degree centrality measure with other well-known measures using ten datasets in order to find a proportion for the common seeds in the seed sets obtained by them. We, thereof, propose an improved high-degree centrality measure (named DegreeDistance) and improve it to enhance accuracy in two phases, FIDD and SIDD, by put a threshold on the number of common neighbors of already-selected seed nodes and a non-seed node which is under investigation to be selected as a seed as well as considering the influence score of seed nodes directly or through their common neighbors over the non-seed node. To evaluate the accuracy and runtime performance of DegreeDistance, FIDD, and SIDD, they are applied to eight large-scale networks and it finally turns out that SIDD dramatically outperforms other well-known measures and evinces comparatively more accurate performance in identifying the most influential nodes.}}

First, based on fluctuation features of RMB exchange rate, we define the first type of fluctuation mode as one specific foreign currency against RMB in four days' fluctuating situations, and the second type as four different foreign currencies against RMB in one day's fluctuating situation. With the transforming method, we construct the unique-currency and multi-currency complex networks. Further, through analyzing the topological features including out-degree, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of fluctuation-mode complex networks, we find that the out-degree distribution of both types of fluctuation mode basically follows power-law distributions with exponents between 1 and 2. The further analysis reveals that the out-degree and the clustering coefficient generally obey the approximated negative correlation. With this result, we confirm previous observations showing that the RMB exchange rate exhibits a characteristic of long-range memory. Finally, we analyze the most probable transmission route of fluctuation modes, and provide probability prediction matrix. The transmission route for RMB exchange rate fluctuation modes exhibits the characteristics of partially closed loop, repeat and reversibility, which lays a solid foundation for predicting RMB exchange rate fluctuation patterns with large volume of data.}}

The eigenvalues of the graph spectrum are combined to create a shape descriptor or signature that is robust under rotation, scale, noise and occlusions. The graph spectrum is associated with its topological properties and can be used to recognize the patterns of a shape. The CNSS method has been tested with a 2D shape benchmark database and is employed for action human activity shapes. The method achieved very good results for discriminating object shapes in different classes, including in situations where there are objects with high levels of within-class variation, partial occlusion and noise contamination.}}

Suppose that the nodes possess nonlinear dynamics and split into several clusters, then an event-triggered control scheme is proposed for synchronization based on the information from stochastic sampling. Meanwhile, an equilibrium is considered to be the synchronization state or the virtual leader for each cluster, which can apply pinning control to the following nodes. Assume that a spanning tree exists in the subgraph consisting of the nodes belonging to the same cluster and the corresponding virtual leader, and the instants for updating controllers are determined by the given event-triggered strategy, then some sufficient conditions for cluster synchronization are presented according to the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality technique. Finally, a specific numerical example is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.}}

abstract = {Abstract 2-D, map-view topological analysis of ten natural and two analogue fault networks was undertaken. The fault arrays range from simple, low-displacement systems, to complex systems arising from multiple stages of deformation, or exhibiting complex local rotation of stresses. Classification of fault arrays was based on fault terminations (I-nodes), splaying and abutting geometries (Y-nodes) and cross-cutting relationships (X-nodes), which permit relatively quick and simple ways of analysing fault terminations and connectivity. Many of the fault networks are predominantly composed of I- and Y-nodes with at most only a minor X-node population, hence discrimination of significant differences between fault networks using just this type of analysis is limited. Subdividing Y-nodes into splaying (Ys), abutting (Ya) and cross-cutting (Yc) types, displaying the data on Ys-Ya-Yc node triangles, as well as generating equivalent networks defined by vertices and edges provides additional information for defining fault networks. Comparison of the Ys-Ya-Yc node triangle and the excess kurtosis of vertice degree distribution identifies seven distinct types of network that show meaningful differences. Such quantitative descriptions are useful for comparing the results of analogue and numerical models with natural examples as well as assessing fault network connectivity, which has implications for the structural interpretation of reservoirs and aquifers. A wide variety of factors contribute to variations in fault networks such as variations in strain, stress rotation with time, fabric inheritance, and stress deflection. While topology cannot be used to identify specific mechanisms, some topological characteristics can help narrow the likely mechanism particularly when used in conjunction with more traditional techniques and observations.}}

Mc-FCFLN network consists of two components: a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive one. A fully complex-valued functional link network (FCFLN) is a cognitive component and the self-regulatory learning method is its meta-cognitive component. As the network does not possess hidden layers, the multi-variable polynomials are represented in the input layer for capturing the nonlinear relationship between the input and the output sample. Moreover, when the sample is presented to the Mc-FCFLN network, the meta-cognitive component decides what to learn, when to learn, and how to learn depending on the knowledge gained by the FCFLN network and the novel information present in the sample. The network can learn sample one after the other and thus the drawback existing with the batch learning strategy can be eliminated while orthogonal least square principle is used for selecting the best polynomial and the recursive least square update is used for tuning the network. Multi-category and binary datasets chosen from the UCI machine learning repository is used for the validation of the proposed classifier. Lastly, a performance comparison of the Mc-FCFLN applied for classification problems shows better classification ability when compared with the other existing classifiers in the literature.}}

An active susceptible node can be infected by all its infected neighbors, while an inactive susceptible node can only be infected by its active infected neighbors. By means of ​mean-field approach and numerical simulations, we explore the critical phenomenon by the combined effects of activity rate and infection rate on spreading dynamics. We show that the critical threshold of infection rate is increased by node activity, and node activity also shows a critical phenomenon given certain infection rate. On the whole, there exists a critical curve consists of pairs of critical activity rate and infection rate. We also analyze theoretically the impact of activity rate and infection rate on the final size of spreading dynamics, which is verified by numerical simulations. This work complements our understanding of spreading dynamics with active nodes and may be used to develop more feasible and more economical methods to control spreading dynamics.}}

They can obtain the rumor from different sources like online social networks and then publish it on their personal sites. In our paper, we discuss this phenomenon in complex networks by adopting the concept of independent spreaders. Rather than getting the rumor from neighbors, independent spreaders learn it from other channels. We further develop the classic "ignorant-spreaders-stiflers" or SIR model of rumor diffusion process in complex networks. A steady-state analysis is conducted to investigate the final spectrum of the rumor spreading under various spreading rate, stifling rate, density of independent spreaders and average degree of the network. Results show that independent spreaders effectively enhance the rumor diffusion process, by delivering the rumor to regions far away from the current rumor infected regions. And though the rumor spreading process in SF networks is faster than that in ER networks, the final size of rumor spreading in ER networks is larger than that in SF networks.}}

A time-varying Lyapunov function/functional approach is applied to L 2 -gain analysis of the synchronization error systems. H infinity synchronization criteria are established to guarantee the synchronization to be robust with respect to disturbance in the sense that the L 2 -gain from the disturbance to the control output is satisfactorily small. For each type of coupling delays, an algorithm involving convex optimization is proposed to design distributed impulsive controllers achieving a suboptimal value of the sum of coupling strengths for a prescribed L 2 -gain.

In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of people in susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and rumor spreading dynamics. We first study the impact of community structure on people's susceptibility. Although the community structure can reduce the number of infected people for same infection rate, it will not significantly affect nodes' susceptibility. We find the susceptibility of individuals is sensitive to the choice of spreading dynamics. For SIR spreading, since the susceptibility is highly correlated to nodes' influence, the topological indicator k -shell can better identify highly susceptible individuals, outperforming degree, betweenness centrality and PageRank. In contrast, in rumor spreading model, where nodes' susceptibility and influence have no clear correlation, degree performs the best among considered topological measures. Our finding highlights the significance of both topological features and spreading mechanisms in identifying highly susceptible population.}}

We propose a method to enhance controllability of a directed network by changing the direction of a small fraction of links while keeping the total number of links unchanged. The main idea of the method is to find candidate links based on the matching path. Extensive numerical simulation on many modeled networks demonstrates that this method is effective. Furthermore, we find that the nodes linked to candidate links have a distinct character, which provide us with a strategy to improve the controllability based on the local structure. Since the whole topology of many real networks is not visible and we only get some local structure information, this strategy is potentially more practical compared to those that demand complete topology information.}}

The existing model fitting approaches mostly suffer from sensitivity to network perturbations, lack of the parameter estimation component, dependency on the size of the networks, and low accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we considered a broad range of network features and employed machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms, distance metric learning, nearest neighbor classification, and artificial neural networks. Our proposed method, which is named ModelFit, outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines with respect to accuracy and noise tolerance in different network datasets.}}

abstract = {Abstract Complex turbine (i.e., steam turbine with multiple controlled and uncontrolled extractions) is one of the most important components in industrial utility system. The function of complex turbine is to generate power electricity, provide steam for the processes, and heat boiler feedwater using uncontrolled extraction steam. Although many studies have focused on the modeling and optimization of utility systems of different scales, few works have been reported on the modeling and operation optimization for utility system containing multiple complex steam turbines. In this paper, a superstructure of utility network consists of multiple interconnected various types of complex turbines (ICSTUN) is constructed. The superstructure demonstrates not only an external utility network that supplies utility energy for the processes but also an internal utility network that supplies boiler feedwater. A systematic modeling approach is developed for robust simulation, validation and operation optimization of ICSTUN. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model based on an improved modeling principle of complex turbine is formulated for the operation optimization of ICSTUN. The MINLP model is able to simultaneously optimize the external and internal utility networks. A solving strategy incorporating model decomposition, model relaxation and case initialization is proposed to find a feasible solution. A large utility network in a petrochemical complex is studied to test the accuracy of the complex turbine model and the effectiveness of the proposed operation optimization methodology. The validation results of the complex turbine model show that the mean relative error between field operation data and simulation data is less than 1.18% and is acceptable in engineering application. The optimization of a single utility plant yields a maximum coal reduction rate of 4.59%, and the optimization of the total utility system consisting of two utility plants yields a maximum coal reduction rate of 6.01%. The optimization contribution is discussed in detail, and several conclusions and suggestions are presented.}}

A hybrid feedback control method is designed to achieve function projective synchronization for the complex network.

Furthermore, we also present a probability approach to the method of Lyapunov functionals to analyze function projective synchronization in the dynamical network under a particular assumption. Our approaches not only can replace the LaSalle-type theorem but also allow improvements of existing results in the literature. In particular, the study also presents an equivalent way of regarding Itô' integral, which may be a useful tool to deal with the problem of synchronization in variety of complex dynamical networks with stochastic effects.

In the real world, the probability of a node to be infected is varying with the network environment; the prior model is not suitable for this scenario. In this paper, we consider an actual epidemic spreading model in which the probability of a node to be infected is related with the number of the infected nodes among its neighbors. We develop an analytical model for this epidemic spreading, named environment aware SIS model (EA-SIS) considering the heterogeneous infection rates, and analytically investigate the epidemic spreading in complex networks. We find that the threshold of EA-SIS is smaller than SIS which means the virus is easier to spread out in the EA-SIS model. In addition, we study several existing immune strategies on the EA-SIS model and propose a novel immune strategy which is based on expected infection time, ETB, of the nodes around the infected nodes for EA-SIS. The simulation results show that the EA-SIS model is more efficient that the SIS model, also, the proposed immune strategy, ETB, is more effective than the local information method and is close to the target immune strategy.}}

To analyze the robustness of this complex interdependent supply chain network when it suffers from disruption events that can cause nodes to fail, we use a cascading failure process that focuses on load propagation. We consider load propagation via connectivity links as node failure spreads through one layer of an interdependent network, and we develop a priority redistribution strategy for failed loads subject to flow constraint. Using a giant component function and a one-to-one directed interdependence relation between nodes in a cyber-layer network and physical-layer network, we construct time-varied functional equations to quantify the dynamic process of failed loads propagation in an interdependent network. Finally, we conduct a numerical simulation for two cases, i.e., single node removal and multiple node removal at the initial disruption. The simulation results show that when we increase the number of removed nodes in an interdependent supply chain network its robustness undergoes a first-order discontinuous phase transition, and that even removing a small number of nodes will cause it to crash.}}

The correlation between the bivariate time series fluctuates over time. The transmission among the correlation modes exhibits a multiscale phenomenon, which provides richer information. To investigate the multiscale transmission of the correlation modes, this paper describes a hybrid model integrating wavelet analysis and complex network theory to decompose and reconstruct the original bivariate time series into sequences in a joint time–frequency domain and defined the correlation modes at each time–frequency domain. We chose the crude oil spot and futures prices as the sample data. The empirical results indicate that the main duration of volatility (32–64 days) for the strongly positive correlation between the crude oil spot price and the futures price provides more useful information for investors. Moreover, the weighted degree, weighted indegree and weighted outdegree of the correlation modes follow power-law distributions. The correlation fluctuation strengthens the extent of persistence over the long term, whereas persistence weakens over the short and medium term. The primary correlation modes dominating the transmission process and the major intermediary modes in the transmission process are clustered both in the short and long term.}}

This results in a complex-valued interval. We then model the resulted complex-valued interval time series via a FCRBFNN. Furthermore, we propose to evolve the FCRBFNN by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and discrete PSO for joint optimization of the structure and parameters.

abstract = {Abstract Community detection is of great importance to understand the structures and functions of networks. Overlap is a significant feature of networks and overlapping community detection has attracted an increasing attention. Many algorithms have been presented to detect overlapping communities. In this paper, we present an ant colony based overlapping community detection algorithm which mainly includes ants' location initialization, ants' movement and post processing phases. An ants' location initialization strategy is designed to identify initial location of ants and initialize label list stored in each node. During the ants' movement phase, the entire ants move according to the transition probability matrix, and a new heuristic information computation approach is redefined to measure similarity between two nodes. Every node keeps a label list through the cooperation made by ants until a termination criterion is reached. A post processing phase is executed on the label list to get final overlapping community structure naturally. We illustrate the capability of our algorithm by making experiments on both synthetic networks and real world networks. The results demonstrate that our algorithm will have better performance in finding overlapping communities and overlapping nodes in synthetic datasets and real world datasets comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms.}}

Additionally, sampled-data controller with time-varying sampling period is considered and is assumed to switch between m different values in a random way with given probability. Then, a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple integral terms is constructed and by using Jensen's inequality and reciprocally convex approach, sufficient conditions under which the dynamical network is exponentially mean-square stable are derived. When applying Jensen's inequality to partition double integral terms in the derivation of linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions, a new kind of linear combination of positive functions weighted by the inverses of squared convex parameters appears. In order to handle such a combination, an effective method is introduced by extending the lower bound lemma. To design the sampled-data controller, the synchronization error system is represented as a switched system. Based on the derived LMI conditions and average dwell-time method, sufficient conditions for the synchronization of switched error system are derived in terms of LMIs. Finally, numerical example is employed to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}}

Methods Medical records from 32 patients with TSC were retrospectively reviewed, including mutational analysis, neuroimaging findings, electroencephalogram findings, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Results Of these patients, six (18.75%) were diagnosed to have autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and 10 (31.25%) were diagnosed to have attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder. In the latter patients, there were no differences in the regional distribution of tuber burden. In addition to a high prevalence of cystic-like tubers, tubers in insular and temporal areas were associated with ASD. Nonsense mutations in the TSC2 gene group had a correlation with autistic behavior. In 26 (81.25%) patients with a history of epilepsy, infantile spasms and partial seizures were the predominant type of epilepsy. Most of them developed seizures prior to age 1 year. Conclusion ASD is a common comorbidity in TSC. Cortical tubers in the temporal lobe and insular area were associated with ASD. The presence of cystic-like tubers on magnetic resonance imaging may also offer a structural marker for ASD in TSC.}}

Detecting natural divisions in such complex networks is proved to be extremely NP-hard problem that recently enjoyed a considerable interest. Among the proposed methods, the field of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) reveals outperformed results. Despite the existing efforts on designing effective multi-objective optimization (MOO) models and investigating the performance of several MOEAs for detecting natural community structures, their techniques lack the introduction of some problem-specific heuristic operators that realize their principles from the natural structure of communities. Moreover, most of these MOEAs evaluate and compare their performance under different algorithmic settings that may hold unmerited conclusions. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, to reformulate the community detection problem as a MOO model that can simultaneously capture the intra- and inter-community structures. Secondly, to propose a heuristic perturbation operator that can emphasize the search for such intra- and inter-community connections in an attempt to offer a positive collaboration with the MOO model. One of the prominent multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (the so-called MOEA/D) is adopted with the proposed community detection model and the perturbation operator to identify the overlapped community sets in complex networks. Under the same MOEA/D characteristic settings, the performance of the proposed model and test results are evaluated against three state-of-the-art MOO models. The experiments on real-world and synthetic social networks of different complexities demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model to define community detection problem. Moreover, the results prove the positive impact of the proposed heuristic operator to harness the strength of all MOO models in both terms of convergence velocity and convergence reliability.}}

According to the structural characteristics of the networks, we propose two new attack strategies named IDB (initial degree and betweenness) and RDB (recalculated degree and betweenness). The strategies are originated from ID (initial degree distribution) and RD (recalculated degree distribution) strategies in which attacks are based on initial structural information of a network. The probability of node removals depends on a new metric combining degree centrality and betweenness centrality. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed strategies on one real-world network and three network models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategies are more efficient than the traditional ID and RD strategies. Specially, the WS small-world network behaves more sensitive to the proposed strategies. The attack efficiency of RDB strategy is improved by 20% to RD strategy, and IDB strategy is improved by 40% to ID strategy.}}

By exploiting the grammar, the generated network captures an activity's global temporal structure while avoiding a time-sliced manner model. In this network, the hidden variables are the start and end times of the component actions, which allows reasoning about duration and observation on interval/segment level. Exact inference can be achieved and yield the posterior probabilities of the timing variables as well as each frame's component label. Importantly, by using uninformative expected value of future observations, the network can predict the probability distribution of the timing of future component actions. We demonstrate this framework on vision tasks such as recognition and temporally segmentation of action sequence, or parsing and making future prediction online when running in streaming mode while observing an assembly task.}}

Cluster synchronization is considered as that in-phase burst synchronization occurs inside each group of the network but diversity may take place among different groups. It is found that both one-cluster and multi-cluster synchronization may exist for chemically excitatory coupled neuronal networks, however, only multi-cluster synchronization can be achieved for chemically inhibitory coupled neuronal networks. The rhythm dynamics of bursting neurons can be described by a quantitative characteristic, the width factor. We also study the effects of coupling schemes, the intrinsic property of neurons and the network topology on the rhythm dynamics of the small world neuronal network. It is shown that the short bursting type is robust with respect to the coupling strength and the coupling scheme. As for the network topology, more links can only change the type of long bursting neurons, and short bursting neurons are also robust to the link numbers.}}

Method The method is based on applying a range of recent BN developments targeted at helping experts build BNs given limited data. While most of the components of the method are based on established work, its novelty is that it provides a rigorous consolidated and generalised framework that addresses the whole life-cycle of BN model development. The method is based on two original and recent validated BN models in forensic psychiatry, known as DSVM-MSS and DSVM-P. Results When employed with the same datasets, the DSVM-MSS demonstrated competitive to superior predictive performance (AUC scores 0.708 and 0.797) against the state-of-the-art (AUC scores ranging from 0.527 to 0.705), and the DSVM-P demonstrated superior predictive performance (cross-validated AUC score of 0.78) against the state-of-the-art (AUC scores ranging from 0.665 to 0.717). More importantly, the resulting models go beyond improving predictive accuracy and into usefulness for risk management purposes through intervention, and enhanced decision support in terms of answering complex clinical questions that are based on unobserved evidence. Conclusions This development process is applicable to any application domain which involves large-scale decision analysis based on such complex information, rather than based on data with hard facts, and in conjunction with the incorporation of expert knowledge for decision support via intervention. The novelty extends to challenging the decision scientists to reason about building models based on what information is really required for inference, rather than based on what data is available and hence, forces decision scientists to use available data in a much smarter way.}}

Initially, a regular complex network is obtained by connecting two nodes if the Euclidean distance between their related pixels is equal or less than a given radius. For each connection, a weight is defined by the difference of the pixel intensities. Given the regular complex network, a function is applied to remove connections whose weight is equal to or below a given threshold. Finally, a feature vector is obtained by calculating the spatial and temporal average degree for networks transformed by different values of threshold and radius. The number of connections of pixels from the same frame and from different frames, respectively, gives the spatial and temporal degrees. Experimental results using synthetic and real dynamic textures have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}}

Set with theoretical parameters, they aim to discover the general evolution laws of supply networks, but the value of their research results in practical applications is weakened. Considering the features of complex supply networks, this paper builds the evolution model in the three dimensions of material, information, and time flows, and adopts a new methodology—agent-based computational experiment (Long, 2014) to implement the evolution model. In this paper, a three-dimensional-flow model and its modeling approaches are proposed. In this model, the approaches for static structure modeling and dynamic evolution modeling are given to support building the material flow model. A general approach for order hierarchical decomposition based on product process, and a coordination solution for agents' consistent knowledge understanding based on public and private ontology with partial information sharing are presented in the information flow modeling. To support collaborating time flows of agents in a distributed and heterogeneous virtual environment, a time flow collaboration scheme based on decoupled model and asynchronous parallel is proposed. The scheme not only ensures the event causality in the virtual world consistent with that in the real world, but also improves the efficiency of the agent-based computational experiment of supply networks to a great extent. In addition, this paper integrates the three-dimensional-flow model for supply network evolution into a reference architecture of agent-based computational experiment, and discusses the implementation solutions of its multiple layers. The architecture provides a more valuable reference to the three-dimensional-flow model implementation as well as the related studies.}}

Combining the heterogeneous mean-field theory with simulations, we show that there exist four regions with distinct nucleation scenarios depending on the values of h and λ : the system undergoes a two-step nucleation process from − 1 configuration to 0 configuration and then to 1 configuration (region I); nucleation becomes a one-step process without an intermediate metastable configuration directly from − 1 configuration to 1 configuration (region II(1)) or directly from 0 configuration to 1 configuration (region II(2)) depending on the sign of λ ; the metastability of the system vanishes and nucleation is thus irrelevant (region III). Furthermore, we show that in the region I nucleation rates for each step intersect that results in the occurrence of a maximum in the total nucleation rate.}}

The detection of communities has great significance for understanding the function and organization of networks. Generally, community detection can be formulated as a modularity optimization problem. However, traditional modularity optimization based algorithms have the resolution limit that they may fail to find communities which are smaller than a certain size. In this paper, we propose a cellular learning automata based algorithm for detecting communities in complex networks. Our algorithm models the whole network as an irregular cellular learning automata (ICLA) and reveals the optimal community structure through the evolution of the cellular learning automata. By interacting with both the global and local environments, our algorithm effectively solves the resolution limit problem of modularity optimization. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our algorithm is effective and efficient at detecting community structure in complex networks.}}

They are used for multiple crack identification in a cantilever beam in the frequency domain. The novelty of the paper is that, these complex-valued neural networks are first applied on inverse problems (damage identification) which come under the category of function approximation. The conventional CRBF network was used in the first stage of ICRBF network and in the second stage a reduced search space moving technique was employed for accurate crack identification. The effectiveness of proposed ICRBF neural network was studied first on a single crack identification problem and then applied to a more challenging problem of multiple crack identification in a cantilever beam with zero noise as well as 5% noise polluted signals. The results proved that, the proposed ICRBF and real-valued Improved RBF (IRBF) neural networks have identified the single and multiple cracks with less than 1% absolute mean percentage error as compared to conventional CRBF and RBF neural networks, mainly because of their second stage reduced search space moving technique. It appears that IRBF neural network is a good compromise considering all factors like accuracy, simplicity and computational effort.}}

abstract = {Abstract Researches of complex networks such as social networks are becoming popular in recent years. Due to the large scale and complex structure of these networks, analysis and studies on a complete network require a lot of computational resources and storage space, which will also consume a large amount of energy. Sampling algorithms provide a new green approach for this problem. Especially some researches related to network communities with high energy consumption can be directly conducted on the sampled networks, which maintain the community structure of original networks. In this paper, we propose a sampling algorithm named Improved Forest Fire Sampling algorithm based on PageRank (IFFST-PR) based on the idea of Forest Fire Sampling and PageRank algorithm. IFFST-PR can maintain the community structure of original networks. We select a set of key nodes called community cluster center, according to a coefficient named community coefficient. Besides, we adopt PageRank to decide the order of initiative sampling nodes. To make a comprehensive comparison of IFFST-PR with other 6 algorithms, we use network community profile and Kolmogorov–Smirno D statistics to prove the consistency between sampled networks and original networks. Experiments applied on 3 different data sets show that IFFST-PR has better performance in terms of most parameters defined in network community profile than those of the other 6 algorithms.}}

The fractal dimension of the acupoints and meridians complex network is determined by means of two independent methods: the first estimates the fractal dimension by means of the box counting and radius mass algorithms, the second performs a straightforward calculation of the dimension from applying the volume definition of fractal dimension to the graph. The estimated fractal dimension varied between 1.28 and 1.91, with correlation ratios of 0.999 in all cases. It was not possible to calculate the fractal dimension by the volume method since the graph volume did not vary in a power law relation to the distance. Therefore it is established that the acupoints and meridians network is not a fractal one. In comparison to other complex systems, the acupoints complex network has a complexity that is similar to the Caenorhabditis elegans metabolic one and to the embryonic cell lineage network, although lower than other biological networks.}}

Specifically, we remove approximately the longest simple path from a network iteratively until there are no paths left in the network. We propose two algorithms, the random augmenting approach (RPA) and the Hamilton-path based approach (HPA), for finding the approximately longest simple path in a network. Results demonstrate that steps of longest-path attacks increase with network density linearly for random networks, while exponentially increasing for scale-free networks. The more homogeneous the degree distribution is, the more fragile the network, which is different from the previous results of node or edge attacks. HPA is generally more efficient than RPA in the longest-path attacks of complex networks. These findings further help us understand the vulnerability of complex systems, better protect complex systems, and design more tolerant complex systems.}}

However, in many cases it is sufficient to control just a part of nodes. Because a community usually plays an independent role in a real complex system, the paper discusses a strategy to control target communities of a complex network. First, the paper shows that the process of controlling target communities will be influenced by their connections with the remainder of the network. Therefore, it is necessary to block the control signals transmitting through these interconnections. Second, the paper proposes a new kind of control nodes that selectively block signal transmissions, termed immune nodes. The immune nodes work along with the driver nodes to facilitate the control of target communities, even if the entire topology of a network is absent. Third, we propose a method to reduce the total number of driver nodes and control nodes by deliberately arranging the matching sequence of nodes. The experiments are carried out on a series of model networks and 11 real networks. The experimental results show that the absolute control cost of controlling communities is less than that of controlling the entire network, when the average degree of the network is low, but the ratio of immune nodes and driver nodes to all nodes increases.}}

Using Lyapunov׳s direct method, the problem of exponential synchronization of the complex spatio-temporal network is formulated as the feasibility problem of spatial differential linear matrix inequality (SDLMI) in space. The feasible solutions to this SDLMI in space can be approximately derived via the standard finite difference method and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization technique.

Similar to the sampled data control systems, we convert the discrete time coupling issue into an effective time-varying delayed coupling network. By constructing the Lyapunov function skillfully, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the realization of the synchronization pattern for all initial values based on the Lyapunov stability theorem and linear matrix inequalities. What is more, the maximum allowable sampling period for communication is obtained through a optimization problem. Numerical simulations are also exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the main result.}}

Different local modularity functions have been proposed in the scientific literature. In this work, we explore applying different ensemble approaches in order to combine different local modularity functions. Explored approaches include naive combine-and-rank approach, ensemble ranking approaches, and ensemble clustering. Experiments are conducted on different real and artificial benchmark networks for which ground truth community partitions are known. Results show that ensemble-ranking approaches provide better results than both state-of-the art approaches and other ensemble approaches.}}

abstract = {Abstract Model validation is a significant issue for the modelling of social network-based transportation models because of the many interacting components (the individuals, the environment, and now the network) in the model. In this paper we focus on a sensitivity analysis for such a model, which is part of a larger validation approach known as process validation. This approach investigates both the structure and behaviour of the model, to evaluate whether the model can be used for prediction. The paper draws on a novel set of experiments with an agent-based model which was developed to explore the effects of social networks on activity and travel behaviour. Several versions of the model were created, beginning with a single day model with no interaction, and then adding in multi-day runs with interactions, in order to demonstrate the validation process. The paper argues that testing the model at different levels of complexity increases confidence in the model and makes it easier to locate components or functionality that require improvement. It concludes by suggesting that this approach to sensitivity testing should be adopted for validation of complex transportation models.}}

The vibrationally averaged PES V00 is characterized by a global T-shaped minimum which occurs at R = 3.385 Å, θ = 90.0° with a well depth of −49.202 cm−1. Based on our three-dimensional PES, bound state calculations were performed for four isotopologues, i.e. 20Ne–14N2, 22Ne–14N2, 20Ne–15N2, 22Ne–15N2, and several intermolecular vibrational states were assigned by analyzing the wavefunctions. Moreover, the averaged structural parameters were determined and the pure rotational transition frequencies with J = 0–5 are predicted. The spectroscopic constants were determined by fitting the rotational energy levels. The theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental data and this work gives more accurate results than those determined previously for the Ne–N2 complex.}}

abstract = {Abstract Process monitoring in chemical industrial is a challenging task due to a larger number of measured variables and complex interactions among them. To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel process monitoring method combining complex network theory with principal component analysis (PCA) is developed. The proposed process monitoring method takes into account not only global information of measured variables, but also the relationships among them and their neighbors. The basic idea of proposed method is to first represent the chemical industrial process as a complex network and then to design its dynamic topological network feature to characterize the local structure information of each measured variable, and monitor the process with conventional global analysis techniques. To build the complex network model, the process measured variables are represented as network nodes. The kernel canonical correlation coefficients that correspond with different measured variables are averaged and represented as network edge. A dynamic change in the threshold method is applied to the evolution of complex network, based on which, the dynamic average degree (DAD) is designed to characterize the local structure information of measured variable. Two case studies including a simple simulation and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process are employed to evaluate the process monitoring performance of the proposed method. The results show that this method has improved fault detection rate (FDR) in comparison with other currently existing conventional process monitoring methods.}}

In order to experiment on the characteristic of overlapping communities, we propose a rewiring algorithm that can change the community structure from overlapping to non-overlapping while maintaining the degree distribution of the network. We simulate the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic process on synthetic scale-free networks and real-world networks by applying our rewiring algorithm. Experiments show that epidemics spread faster on networks with higher level of overlapping communities. Furthermore, overlapping communities' effect interacts with the average degree's effect. Our work further illustrates the important role of overlapping communities in the process of epidemic spreading.}}

The analysis in the paper employ results from the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side as introduced by Filippov. By using the framework of Filippov solution, differential inclusion theory, an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, several new sufficient conditions for global dissipativity, global exponential dissipativity and strictly ( Q , S , R ) -dissipativity are derived in the form of complex-valued as well as real-valued LMIs. Both real and complex-valued LMIs guarantee feasibility results for addressed MCVNNs. These LMIs can be solved by using standard available numerical packages. Moreover, the global attractive sets which are positive invariant are obtained. Finally, three numerical examples are established to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.}}

The most tailored tools to face this problem aim at managing networks of contradictions. They try to establish the starting point for an effective problem solving process. The task suffers from subjective evaluations or difficulties with applying complex algorithmic procedures. Besides, the existing approaches overlook the potential benefits descending from overcoming each single contradiction. The authors illustrate a strategy to prioritize technical contradictions, which includes metrics concerning customer value. More specifically, the implemented criteria feature the probability of succeeding in the marketplace. Thus, a business perspective is introduced in the problem solving process. The proposal has been experimented through an application to a mature phase included in the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical tablets. Said production phase, taken as the reference technical system, figures out 239 different contradictions. The application of the developed approach allowed to individuate contradictions whose solution has considerably influenced the technical evolution of the treated industrial sector.}}

Five kinds of flow pattern including bubble flow, bubble–slug flow, slug flow, slug–churn flow and churn flow are measured, and then constructed 178 corresponding flow pattern complex networks in order to reveal the dynamical characteristics of two-phase flow. It is found that different flow pattern complex network present different community structure, when the correspondence between the threshold and the mean of similarity matrix meet specific proportion. The results show that the power-law exponent of degree distribution and network information entropy of flow pattern complex network is sensitive to the flow pattern transition, which can be employed to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of two-phase flow.

Furthermore, the stability of virus-free equilibria is analyzed via a threshold value associated with the topology of the Internet and the model parameters. It is established that, if the threshold value is less than or equal to the unity, the virus-free equilibria are alternatively globally attractive, resulting in virus eradication, while if the threshold value is greater than unity, the antivirus-independent virus equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, leading to virus diffusion, while the antivirus-dependent virus equilibrium also is globally asymptotically stable. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the analytical results.}}

The main idea behind this approach is to compute once, locally and for few reference shapes, some representative finite element solutions for different values of the parameters and with a set of different suitable boundary conditions on the boundaries: these functions will represent the basis of a reduced space where the global solution is sought for. The continuity of the latter is assured by a classical domain decomposition approach. Test results on Poisson problem show the flexibility of the proposed method in which accuracy and computational time may be tuned by varying the number of reduced basis functions employed, or the set of boundary conditions used for defining locally the basis functions. The proposed approach simplifies the pre-computation of the reduced basis space by splitting the global problem into smaller local subproblems. Thanks to this feature, it allows dealing with arbitrarily complex network and features more flexibility than a classical global reduced basis approximation where the topology of the geometry is fixed.}}

In particular, we derive multivariate complex networks from different flow conditions and demonstrate that the generated networks corresponding to different flow patterns exhibit distinct topological structures. For each generated network, we exploit weighted clustering coefficient and closeness centrality to quantitatively probe the network topological properties associated with dynamic flow behavior. The results suggest that our multivariate complex network analysis allows quantitatively uncovering the transitions of distinct flow patterns and yields deep insights into the nonlinear dynamic behavior underlying gas–liquid flows.}}

Recently, genome-wide molecular measurements, data mining and bioinformatics approaches have provided the means to explore human diseases from a molecular basis. The exploration of diseases and a system of disease relationships based on the integration of genome-wide molecular data with the human interactome could offer a powerful perspective for understanding the molecular architecture of diseases. Recently, subnetwork markers have proven to be more robust and reliable than individual biomarker genes selected based on gene expression profiles alone, and achieve higher accuracy in disease classification. We have applied one of these methodologies to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) data that we have generated using a microarray and identified significant subnetworks associated with the disease.

The resulted networks, consequently, are analysed using the various network analysis tools present in literature in order to get a better insight on the processes, patterns and interactions occurring in climate system. In this regard we present ClimNet; a complete set of software tools to construct climate networks based on a wide range of linear (cross correlation) and nonlinear (Information theoretic) measures. The presented software will allow the construction of large networks' adjacency matrices from climate time series while supporting functions to tune relationships to different time-scales by means of symbolic ordinal analysis. The provided tools have been used in the production of various original contributions in climate research.

However, in these methods, several objects that are connected by high weights may be decomposed into different communities, even when they intuitively belong to a single community. In this case, it is more effective to classify the objects into the same community because they perform important roles in controlling and understanding the network. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose a method of detecting optimal community structures in a complex network using interaction-based edge clustering. Our approach is to consider network topology as well as interaction density when identifying overlapping and hierarchical communities. Additionally, we measure the differences between the quantity and quality of intra- and inter-community interactions to evaluate the quality of the community structure. We test our method on several benchmark networks with known community structures. Additionally, after applying our method to several real-world complex networks, we evaluate our method through comparison with other methods. We find that the community quality and the overlap quality for our method surpass the results of the other methods.}}

We survey three major lines of linguistic research from the complex network approach: 1) characterization of human language as a multi-level system with complex network analysis; 2) linguistic typological research with the application of linguistic networks and their quantitative measures; and 3) relationships between the system-level complexity of human language (determined by the topology of linguistic networks) and microscopic linguistic (e.g., syntactic) features (as the traditional concern of linguistics). We show that the models and quantitative tools of complex networks, when exploited properly, can constitute an operational methodology for linguistic inquiry, which contributes to the understanding of human language and the development of linguistics. We conclude our review with suggestions for future linguistic research from the complex network approach: 1) relationships between the system-level complexity of human language and microscopic linguistic features; 2) expansion of research scope from the global properties to other levels of granularity of linguistic networks; and 3) combination of linguistic network analysis with other quantitative studies of language (such as quantitative linguistics).}}

abstract = {Abstract Complex networks are popularly used to represent a lot of practical systems in the domains of biology and sociology, and the structure of community is one of the most important network attributes which has received an enormous amount of attention. Community detection is the process of discovering the community structure hidden in complex networks, and modularity Q is one of the best known quality functions measuring the quality of communities of networks. In this paper, a multi-agent genetic algorithm, named as MAGA-Net, is proposed to optimize modularity value for the community detection. An agent, coded by a division of a network, represents a candidate solution. All agents live in a lattice-like environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice point. A series of operators are designed, namely split and merging based neighborhood competition operator, hybrid neighborhood crossover, adaptive mutation and self-learning operator, to increase modularity value. In the experiments, the performance of MAGA-Net is validated on both well-known real-world benchmark networks and large-scale synthetic LFR networks with 5000 nodes. The systematic comparisons with GA-Net and Meme-Net show that MAGA-Net outperforms these two algorithms, and can detect communities with high speed, accuracy and stability.}}

Further, adaptive strategy is adopted to relax the restrictions on the impulsive intervals and reduce the control cost. Noticeably, the proposed adaptive pinning impulsive control scheme is universal for different dynamical networks to some extent. The impulsive instants are chosen by solving a series of maximum problems subject to the derived conditions.

The communities with hierarchical and overlapping structures and the special nodes like hubs and outliers are all common structure features to the networks. Network structure investigation has attracted considerable research effort recently. However, existing studies have only partially explored the structure features. In this paper, a label propagation based integrated network structure investigation algorithm (LINSIA) is proposed. The main novelty here is that LINSIA can uncover hierarchical and overlapping communities, as well as hubs and outliers. Moreover, LINSIA can provide insight into the label propagation mechanism and propose a parameter-free solution that requires no prior knowledge. In addition, LINSIA can give out a soft-partitioning result and depict the degree of overlapping nodes belonging to each relevant community. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.}}

According to the radical kinetic scheme, a simulation system of the ethylene cracking process has been developed include the feedstock reconstruction model, detailed kinetic schemes generator, and the reactor simulation model. As the complex networks research has grown steadily for its potential to represent, characterize and model a wide range of intricate natural systems and phenomena, a modified PageRank algorithm is applied to represent the topological structure and dynamic system characteristic of ECR networks. As a result, the hubs and authorities in reaction networks are illustrated by the algorithm and correction coefficients derived from these hubs is applied in detailed kinetic schemes generator.

abstract = {Abstract Current complex engineering software systems are often composed of many components and can be built based on a multiagent approach, resulting in what are called complex multiagent software systems. In a complex multiagent software system, various software agents may cite the operation results of others, and the citation relationships among agents form a citation network; therefore, the importance of a software agent in a system can be described by the citations from other software agents. Moreover, the software agents in a system are often divided into various groups, and each group contains the agents undergoing similar tasks or having related functions; thus, it is necessary to find the influential agent group (not only the influential individual agent) that can influence the system outcome utilities more than the others. To solve such a problem, this paper presents a new model for finding influential agent groups based on group centrality analyses in citation networks. In the presented model, a concept of extended group centrality is presented to evaluate the impact of an agent group, which is collectively determined by both direct and indirect citations from other agents outside the group. Moreover, the presented model addresses two typical types of agent groups: one is the adjacent group where agents of a group are adjacent in the citation network, and the other is the scattering group where agents of a group are distributed separately in the citation network. Finally, we present case studies and simulation experiments to prove the effectiveness of the presented model.}}

Three key indices of a complex network are listed and we relate them with the train service plan.

A computing case is performed to illustrate the applications of the evaluation model and the algorithm.

However, the relationship also presents fluctuation which draws our attention. This paper designed a complex network approach for examining the dynamics of the co-movement between crude oil futures and spot prices. We defined the co-movement modes by a coarse-graining procedure and analyzed the transformation characteristics between the modes by weighted complex network models and evolutionary models. We analyzed the parameters of these models by using the West Texas Intermediate crude oil future prices and the Daqing (China) crude oil spot prices from November 25, 2002 to March 22, 2011 as sample data. The results indicate that the co-movement modes of the crude oil futures and spot prices are clustered around a few critical modes during the evolution. The co-movement of the crude oil prices has the characteristic of grouping, and the conversion of the co-movement modes requires an average of 5–7 days. There are some important transitional phases in the evolution of prices, and the results validate the current trend of rising oil prices. This research may provide information for the oil price decision-making process, and more importantly, provides a new approach for examining the co-movement between variables.}}

We analyze theoretical models (random, small-world and scale-free) and real networks (a collaboration network and a metabolic networks) along with the shortest path length, vertex degree, local cluster coefficient and betweenness centrality measures. In such an analysis, we propose the use of three stochastic quantifiers: the Kullback–Leibler divergence and the Jensen–Shannon and Hellinger distances. The sensitivity of these measures was analyzed with respect to the following perturbations: edge addition, edge removal, edge rewiring and node removal, all of them applied at different intensities. The results reveal that the evaluated measures are influenced by these perturbations. Additionally, hypotheses tests were performed to verify the behavior of the degree distribution to identify the intensity of the perturbations that leads to break this property.}}

Then two maximal sub-graphs having the key pair-vertices can be merged into a new larger sub-graph using some belonging degree functions. Furthermore we extend the modularity function to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In addition, overlapping nodes between communities are founded successfully. Finally we report the comparison between the modularity and the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm with some other existing algorithms.

The crystal structure of the binuclear Cu(II) complex has been determined by X-ray single-crystal diffraction technique. Both copper(II) metal centers are bridged by pyrazine. The coordination environment around each copper(II) atom can be described as a distorted octahedral geometry. The axial positions of each Cu(II) complex are occupied by two water molecules and equatorial positions are occupied by a tridentate chelidamic acid dianion and a pyrazine molecule that functions as a linear bidentate ligand bridging two Cu(II) complexes to form a dimer. Hydrogen bonding and CO⋯π interactions link the binuclear Cu(II) complex generating the 3D infinite network. These assemblies are described and analyzed by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations since they play an important role in the construction of three-dimensional supramolecular frameworks. The protonation constants of pyrazine and chelidamic acid as the building blocks of the proton transfer systems (H2chel-pyz) and their corresponding stability constants were determined by potentiometric studies. The stoichiometry and stability constants of H2chel-pyz complex with Cu2+ was investigated by potentiometric technique in aqueous solution.

Human behavior such as contact precautions and social distancing clearly influence disease prevalence, but disease prevalence can in turn alter human behavior, forming a coupled, nonlinear system. Moreover, in many cases, the spatial structure of the population cannot be ignored, such that social and behavioral processes and/or transmission of infection must be represented with complex networks. Research on studying coupled disease–behavior dynamics in complex networks in particular is growing rapidly, and frequently makes use of analysis methods and concepts from statistical physics. Here, we review some of the growing literature in this area. We contrast network-based approaches to homogeneous-mixing approaches, point out how their predictions differ, and describe the rich and often surprising behavior of disease–behavior dynamics on complex networks, and compare them to processes in statistical physics. We discuss how these models can capture the dynamics that characterize many real-world scenarios, thereby suggesting ways that policy makers can better design effective prevention strategies. We also describe the growing sources of digital data that are facilitating research in this area. Finally, we suggest pitfalls which might be faced by researchers in the field, and we suggest several ways in which the field could move forward in the coming years.}}

Full geometry optimizations of PRP by the QM/MM model have been carried out starting from the geometry of heavy atoms determined by the recent high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment on PSII refined to 1.9 Å resolution. The optimized MnMn and CaMn distances by large-scale QM/MM are consistent with the EXAFS results, removing out the discrepancy between the refined XRD and EXAFS. Computational results from QM/MM calculations have demonstrated the labile nature of the MnaO(5)Mnd bond of the CaMn4O5 cluster in the OEC of PSII which allows left (L)-opened, quasi-central (CQ)-, and right (R)-opened structures. This confirms the feasibility of the left- and right-hand scenarios for water oxidation in the OEC of PSII that are dependent on the hydrogen bonding networks. The QM/MM computations have elucidated the networks structures: hydrogen bonding O…O(N) and O…H distances and O(N)H…O angles in PRP, together with the ClO(N) and Cl…H distances and O(N)H…Cl angles for chloride anions. The obtained hydrogen bonding networks are fully consistent with the results from XRD and available experiments such as EXAFS, showing the reliability of our theoretical system model that is crucial for investigations of functions of PSII such as water oxidation. The QM/MM computations have elucidated possible roles of chloride anions in OEC of PSII for proton transfers. The QM/MM computational results have provided useful information for the understanding and explanation of several experimental results obtained with mutants of the OEC of PSII. The possible implications of the present results are discussed in relation to our theoretical system models of PSII, strong or weak perturbations of the system structures by mutations, damage-free X-ray free-electron laser structure of PSII, and bioinspired working hypotheses for the development of artificial water oxidation systems which use 3d transition metal complexes.}}

abstract = {Abstract We study the problem of evolutionary escape that is the process whereby a population under sudden changes in the selective pressures acting upon it try to evade extinction by evolving from previously well-adapted phenotypes to those that are favoured by the new selective pressure. We perform a comparative analysis between results obtained by modelling genotype space as a regular hypercube (H-graphs), which is the scenario considered in previous work on the subject, to those corresponding to a complex genotype–phenotype network (B-graphs). In order to analyse the properties of the escape process on both these graphs, we apply a general theory based on multi-type branching processes to compute the evolutionary dynamics and probability of escape. We show that the distribution of distances between phenotypes in B-graphs exhibits a much larger degree of heterogeneity than in H-graphs. This property, one of the main structural differences between both types of graphs, causes heterogeneous behaviour in all results associated to the escape problem. We further show that, due to the heterogeneity characterising escape on B-graphs, escape probability can be underestimated by assuming a regular hypercube genotype network, even if we compare phenotypes at the same distance in H-graphs. Similarly, it appears that the complex structure of B-graphs slows down the rate of escape.}}

Mathematical formulas are derived and differential equations are solved to analyze the equilibrium of the propagation dynamics. Stability is evaluated in terms of the balance factor G and it is shown that equilibrium where the number of nodes in different states does not change, is globally asymptotically stable if G ⩾ 1. The theoretical results derived are verified by numerical simulations. We also investigate the effect of some network parameters, e.g. node density and node movement speed, on the failure propagation dynamics in complex dynamical communication networks to gain insights for effective measures of control of the scale and duration of the failure propagation in complex dynamical communication networks.}}

Centrality measures are used to rank node influence in a spreading dynamics. Here we propose a node influence measure based on the centrality of a node and its neighbors' centrality, which we call the neighborhood centrality. By simulating the spreading processes in six real-world networks, we find that the neighborhood centrality greatly outperforms the basic centrality of a node such as the degree and coreness in ranking node influence and identifying the most influential spreaders. Interestingly, we discover a saturation effect in considering the neighborhood of a node, which is not the case of the larger the better. Specifically speaking, considering the 2-step neighborhood of nodes is a good choice that balances the cost and performance. If further step of neighborhood is taken into consideration, there is no obvious improvement and even decrease in the ranking performance. The saturation effect may be informative for studies that make use of the local structure of a node to determine its importance in the network.}}

Centralized logging allows keeping track of events occurring in ICT networks. Therefore a central log store is essential for timely detection of problems such as service quality degradations, performance issues or especially security-relevant cyber attacks. There exist various software tools such as security information and event management (SIEM) systems, log analysis tools and anomaly detection systems, which exploit log data to achieve this. While there are many products on the market, based on different approaches, the identification of the most efficient solution for a specific infrastructure, and the optimal configuration is still an unsolved problem. Today׳s general test environments do not sufficiently account for the specific properties of individual infrastructure setups. Thus, tests in these environments are usually not representative. However, testing on the real running productive systems exposes the network infrastructure to dangerous or unstable situations. The solution to this dilemma is the design and implementation of a highly realistic test environment, i.e. sandbox solution, that follows a different – novel – approach. The idea is to generate realistic network event sequence (NES) data that reflects the actual system behavior and which is then used to challenge network analysis software tools with varying configurations safely and realistically offline. In this paper we define a model, based on log line clustering and Markov chain simulation to create this synthetic log data. The presented model requires only a small set of real network data as an input to understand the complex real system behavior. Based on the input׳s characteristics highly realistic customer specified NES data is generated. To prove the applicability of the concept developed in this work, we conclude the paper with an illustrative example of evaluation and test of an existing anomaly detection system by using generated NES data.}}

New method An integrated approach to quantify rhythmic, balancing and coupling neural behaviors based upon power spectral analysis, power ratio analysis and cross-frequency power coupling analysis was presented. Deep brain local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the thalamus of patients with neuropathic pain and dystonic tremor. t-Test was applied to assess the difference between the two patient groups. Results The rhythmic behavior measured by power spectral analysis showed significant power spectrum difference in the high beta band between the two patient groups. The balancing behavior measured by power ratio analysis showed significant power ratio differences at high beta band to 8–20 Hz, and 30–40 Hz to high beta band between the patient groups. The coupling behavior measured by cross-frequency power coupling analysis showed power coupling differences at (theta band, high beta band) and (45–55 Hz, 70–80 Hz) between the patient groups. Comparison with existing method The study provides a strategy for studying the brain states in a multi-dimensional behavior space and a framework to screen quantitative characteristics for biomarkers related to diseases or nuclei.

However, the acquaintance immunization strategy fails to take the time-varying factor and local information of nodes into consideration, which limits its effectiveness in some specific network topology. Our improved immunization strategy is based on a new mathematical model Network Structure Index (NSI), which digs deep to measure the connection property and surrounding influence of a node׳s neighbor nodes to better determine the importance of nodes during immunization. Both mathematical derivation and the simulation program tested on various network topology support our idea that this improved acquaintance immunization strategy protects more nodes from infection and immunizes important nodes more efficiently than the original strategies. As to say, our strategy has more adaptability and achieves a more reasonable balanced point between cost and effectiveness.}}

The main metrics we study are the timing effect of combating rumor and the identification of influential nodes, which are what an efficient strategy against rumor may concern about. The results indicate that, there exists robust time dependence of anti-rumor dynamics and the timing threshold emerges as a consequence of launching the anti-rumor at different delay time after the beginning of rumor spreading. The timing threshold as a critical feature is further verified on a series of Barabási–Albert scale-free networks (BA networks), where anti-rumor dynamics arises explicitly. The timing threshold is a network-dependent quantity and its value decreases as the average degree of the BA network increases until close to zero. Meanwhile, coreness also constitutes a better topological descriptor to identify hubs. Our results will hopefully be useful for the understanding of spreading behaviors of rumor and anti-rumor and suggest a possible avenue for further study of interplays of multiple pieces of information on complex network.}}

Specifically the detection of link failures in a network synchronization process from noisy measurements at a single network component is considered. By phrasing the detection task as a Maximum A Posteriori Probability hypothesis testing problem, we are able to obtain conditions under which the detection is (1) improved over the a priori and (2) asymptotically perfect, in terms of the network spectrum and graph. We find that, in the case where the detector has knowledge of the network's state, perfect detection is possible under general connectivity conditions regardless of the measurement location. When the detector does not have state knowledge, a remote signature permits improved but not perfect detection, under the same connectivity conditions. At its essence, detectability is achieved because of the close connection between a network's topology, its eigenvalues and local response characteristics.}}

Nodes newly introduced in these modules tended to attach to themselves (clustering) and existing high in-degree nodes. We proposed the alpha β Model to generate call graphs for different kernel modules. The model preserved asymmetry in the degree distributions and simulated the new node behaviors. Last, we discussed how the alpha β Model could be used effectively to study the robustness of complex networks.}}

Improvements in high-throughput technologies have resulted in a large number of available protein–protein interactions. By taking advantage of these interaction data, researchers have proposed many computational methods to identify essential proteins at the network level. Most of these approaches focus on the topology of a static protein interaction network. However, the protein interaction network changes with time and condition. This important inherent dynamics of the protein interaction network is overlooked by previous methods. In this paper, we introduce a new method named CDLC to predict essential proteins by integrating dynamic local average connectivity and in-degree of proteins in complexes. CDLC is applied to the protein interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results show that CDLC outperforms five other methods (Degree Centrality (DC), Local Average Connectivity-based method (LAC), Sum of ECC (SoECC), PeC and Co-Expression Weighted by Clustering coefficient (CoEWC)). In particular, CDLC could improve the prediction precision by more than 45% compared with DC methods. CDLC is also compared with the latest algorithm CEPPK, and a higher precision is achieved by CDLC. CDLC is available as Supplementary materials. The default settings of active threshold and alpha-parameter are 0.8 and 0.1, respectively.}}

The alteration of view angle modifies the PNVG and its properties such as the average node degree, average link length of the graph as well as cluster quantity of built graph, etc. We calculated and analyzed different PNVG properties depending on the view angle for different types of the time series such as the random (uncorrelated, correlated and fractal) and cardiac rhythm time series for healthy and ill patients. Investigation of different PNVG properties shows that the view angle gives a new approach to characterize the structure of the time series that are invisible in the conventional version of the algorithm. It is also shown that the PNVG approach allows us to distinguish, identify and describe in detail various time series.}}

The results indicate that the global oil export core network displays a scale-free behaviour, in which the trade position of nodes presents obvious heterogeneity and the ‘hub nodes' play a ‘bridge' role in the formation process of the trade network. The current global oil trade network can be divided into three trading blocs, including the ‘South America-West Africa-North America' trading bloc, the ‘Middle East–Asian–Pacific region' trading bloc, and ‘the former Soviet Union–North Africa–Europe' trading bloc. Geopolitics and diplomatic relations are the two main reasons for this regional oil trade structure. Moreover, the global oil trade network presents a ‘robust but yet fragile' characteristic, and the impacts of trade interruption always tend to spread throughout the whole network even if the occurrence of export disruptions is localised.}}

A common tendency in the literature is to see sustainable supply chain management as something that is undertaken by a focal firm at the end of the chain. Even though many scholars point to the need for cooperative approaches, focal firms are still considered to manage supply chains from one fixed and coherent vantage point: the managerial outlook of the focal firm itself, understood as a structurally coherent, top-down controlled unit. Through an illustration from the Swedish retail sector, we argue that such a vantage point is problematic. We suggest a deeper analysis of focal firms and sustainable supply chain management in terms of a network perspective employed mainly in the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) literature. The adopted network perspective recognizes both internal and external complexity of sustainable supply chain management, implying, for example, difficulties to control entire organizations and the existence of multiple supply chains to manage. It is also suggested that sustainable supply networks may be a viable concept to use when dealing with sustainability issues related to production, since it relates sustainability in the supply chain to the more general responsibility context of firms.}}

The experimental results on a number of benchmark networks show the effectiveness of this method and the evolution of network topology is captured. Furthermore, we explore how network structure affects its controllability and find that the sparser a network is, the more control nodes are needed to control it and the larger the differences between node degrees, the more control nodes are needed to achieve the full control. Our framework provides an alternative to controllability optimization and can be applied to arbitrary networks without any limitations.}}

Identifying the most influential nodes in a network can be useful in many applications like immunization of nodes in case of epidemic spreading, during intentional attacks on complex networks. A lot of research is being done to devise centrality measures which could efficiently identify the most influential nodes in a network. There are two major approaches to this problem: On one hand, deterministic strategies that exploit knowledge about the overall network topology, while on the other end, random strategies are completely agnostic about the network structure. Centrality measures that can deal with a limited knowledge of the network structure are of prime importance. Indeed, in practice, information about the global structure of the overall network is rarely available or hard to acquire. Even if available, the structure of the network might be too large that it is too much computationally expensive to calculate global centrality measures. To that end, a centrality measure is proposed here that requires information only at the community level. Indeed, most of the real-world networks exhibit a community structure that can be exploited efficiently to discover the influential nodes. We performed a comparative evaluation of prominent global deterministic strategies together with stochastic strategies, an available and the proposed deterministic community-based strategy. Effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by performing experiments on synthetic and real-world networks with community structure in the case of immunization of nodes for epidemic control.}}

Based on the fracture mechanics, the criterion for initiation and propagation of a fracture was introduced to analyze the tendency of a propagating angle and factors affecting propagating pressure. On this basis, a mathematic model with a complex fracture network was established to investigate how the fracture network form changes with different parameters, including rock mechanics, in-situ stress distribution, fracture properties, and frac treatment parameters. The solving process of this model was accelerated by classifying the calculation nodes on the extending direction of the fracture by equal pressure gradients, and solving the geometrical parameters prior to the iteration fitting flow distribution. With the initiation and propagation criterion as the bases for the propagation of branch fractures, this method decreased the iteration times through eliminating the fitting of the fracture length in conventional 3D fracture simulation. The simulation results indicated that the formation with abundant natural fractures and smaller in-situ stress difference is sufficient conditions for fracture network development. If the pressure in the hydraulic fractures can be kept at a high level by temporary sealing or diversion, the branch fractures will propagate further with minor curvature radius, thus enlarging the reservoir stimulation area. The simulated shape of fracture network can be well matched with the field microseismic mapping in data point range and distribution density, validating the accuracy of this model.}}

For better understanding the underlying design principles of LOS, we explore the coupling correlations of components in LOS from aspects of topology and function. The result shows that the component for device drivers has a strong manifestation in topology while a weak manifestation in function. However, the component for process management shows the contrary phenomenon. Moreover, in an effort to investigate the impact of system failures on networks, we make a comparison between the networks traced from normal and failure status of LOS. This leads to a conclusion that the failure will change function calls which should be executed in normal status and introduce new function calls in the meanwhile.}}

In this paper, we study the impact of maximal vertex coverage (MVC) attack in large complex networks, where the attacker aims at deleting as many edges of the network as possible by attacking a small fraction of nodes. First, we present two metrics to measure the impact of MVC attack. To compute these metrics, we propose an efficient randomized greedy algorithm with near-optimal performance guarantee. Second, we generalize the MVC attack into an uncertain setting, in which a node is deleted by the attacker with a prior probability. We refer to the MVC attack under such uncertain environment as the probabilistic MVC attack. Based on the probabilistic MVC attack, we propose two adaptive metrics, and then present an adaptive greedy algorithm for calculating such metrics accurately and efficiently. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 real datasets. The results show that P2P and co-authorship networks are extremely robust under the MVC attack while both the online social networks and the Email communication networks exhibit vulnerability under the MVC attack. In addition, the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for computing the proposed metrics.}}

It currently serves as a research tool in a broad range of human brain studies in normal and pathological conditions, as is the case of epilepsy. To date, most fMRI studies aimed at characterizing brain activity in response to various active paradigms. More recently, a number of strategies have been used to characterize the low-frequency oscillations of the ongoing fMRI signals when individuals are at rest. These datasets have been largely analyzed in the context of functional connectivity, which inspects the covariance of fMRI signals from different areas of the brain. In addition, resting state fMRI is progressively being used to evaluate complex network features of the brain. These strategies have been applied to a number of different problems in neuroscience, which include diseases such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Hence, we herein aimed at introducing the subject of complex network and how to use it for the analysis of fMRI data. This appears to be a promising strategy to be used in clinical epilepsy. Therefore, we also review the recent literature that has applied these ideas to the analysis of fMRI data in patients with epilepsy.

The decomposition approaches are hierarchical and identify nested sets of nodes with increasing centrality properties. While most studies have been concerned with unweighted networks, i.e. k -core analysis, recent works have introduced network decomposition methods that apply to weighted networks. Here, we investigate the relationship between k -core decomposition for unweighted networks and s -core decomposition for weighted networks by systematically employing a link-weight scheme that gradually discretizes the link weights. We applied this approach to the Erdős–Rényi model and the scale-free configuration model for five different weight distributions, and two empirical networks, the US air traffic network and a Facebook network. We find that (1) both uniformly random and positively correlated link-weight distributions give rise to highly stable s -core decompositions with respect to discretization levels. (2) For negatively correlated link-weight distributions, the resulting s -core decomposition has no similarity to the k -cores. Since several combinations of network topology and link-weight distributions give rise to a core-structure that is highly similar to the full s -core for a large range of link-discretization levels, it is possible to significantly speed up the numerical s -core analysis for these situations.}}

However, little is known about the behaviors of these networks under intentional attacks guided by damage (damage attack), in which adversaries choose the vertex with the largest damage to attack. In this article, we systematically investigate damage attack and behaviors of real networks as well as synthetic networks against damage attack. Empirical study shows that for real networks in a wide range of domains there exists a critical-point before which damage attack is more destructive than degree attack. This is further explained by the fact that degree attack tends to produce networks with more heterogeneous damage distribution than damage attack. Results in this article strongly suggest that damage attack is one of the most destructive attacks and deserves additional study. Our understanding about damage attack may also shed light on efficient solutions to protect real networks against damage attack.}}

The understanding of the pattern of the crude oil prices' mutual propagation is essential for analyzing the development of global oil trade. Previous research has focused mainly on the fuzzy long- or short-term one-to-one propagation of bivariate oil prices, generally ignoring various patterns of periodical multivariate propagation. This study presents a wavelet-based network approach to help uncover the multipath propagation of multivariable crude oil prices in a joint time–frequency period. The weekly oil spot prices of the OPEC member states from June 1999 to March 2011 are adopted as the sample data. First, we used wavelet analysis to find different subseries based on an optimal decomposing scale to describe the periodical feature of the original oil price time series. Second, a complex network model was constructed based on an optimal threshold selection to describe the structural feature of multivariable oil prices. Third, Bayesian network analysis (BNA) was conducted to find the probability causal relationship based on periodical structural features to describe the various patterns of periodical multivariable propagation. Finally, the significance of the leading and intermediary oil prices is discussed. These findings are beneficial for the implementation of periodical target-oriented pricing policies and investment strategies.}}

In particular we collect the browsing records of millions of users on 1000 Web forums in two months. In the constructed networks, nodes are threads and edges represent the switch of users between threads in an hour. The investigated network properties include the number of threads N , the number of users U V , and the number of clicks, P V . We find scaling functions P V ∼ U V θ 1 , P V ∼ N θ 3 , and U V ∼ N θ 2 , in which the scaling exponents are always greater than 1. This means that (1) the studied networks maintain a self-similar flow structure in time, i.e., large networks are simply the scale-up versions of small networks; and (2) large networks are more "productive", in the sense that an average user would generate more clicks in the larger systems. We propose a revised version of Zipf's law to quantify the time-invariant flow structure of attention networks and relate it to the observed scaling properties. We also demonstrate the applied consequences of our research: forum-classification based on scaling properties.}}

The dynamics between human activity and technological systems impact upon many processes in society and nature. This involves non-linear dynamics requiring an understanding of how technology and human behaviour influence each other and co-evolve. Conventionally, technological and behavioural systems are analyzed as separate entities. We develop an integrated theoretical and methodological approach termed techno-behavioural dynamics focussing on networked interactions between technology and behaviour across multiple system states. We find that positive feedback between technology learning, evolving preferences and network effects can lead to tipping points in complex sociotechnical systems. We also demonstrate how mean-field and agent-based models are complimentary for capturing a hierarchy of analytical resolutions in a common problem domain. Assessing and predicting co-evolutionary dynamics between technology and human behaviour can help avoid systems lock-in and inform a range of adaptive responses to environmental and societal risk.}}

The coupled networks are supposed to be faulted randomly and perturbed by bounded time delays and disturbances. Moreover, additive controller gain variations that can also be considered as actuator bias faults are proposed. Adaptive sliding mode compensation control schemes were developed to update control gains in order to eliminate these non-ideal factors. Then, a class of distributed robust adaptive sliding mode controllers was constructed to automatically compensate for the faulted and variational effects based on the information from adaptive schemes. On the basis of Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that average tracking of the resulting adaptive complex networked systems can be achieved. An example is provided to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sliding mode design technique.}}

Delay-dependent asymptotically stability condition is established for the system of the estimation error, which can be readily solved by using the LMI toolbox in MATLAB, the solvability of derived conditions depends on not only the size of the delay and the sampling period, but also the probability of taking values of the sampling period.

The retarded, neutral and distributed delays are considered to be interval mode-dependent and time-varying, while the sampling period is assumed to be time-varying and bounded. By the interval dividing approach, a new augmented stochastic Lyapunov functional is constructed, which contains some triple-integral terms to reduce the conservativeness. Then the delay-range-dependent and rate-dependent exponential stability conditions for the closed-loop error system are obtained by the Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability theory, integral matrix inequalities and reciprocally convex lemma. Based on these new stability conditions, the sampled-data exponential synchronization controllers are found in terms of the solutions to linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed theoretic result.}}

In this paper, we first deduce the mathematical relationship between eigenvalue perturbation and its corresponding eigenvector perturbation for network reconstructions. Afterwards, two perturbed forms of eigenvector spectrum, global perturbation and local perturbation, are defined, such that we can examine the impacts of eigenvector perturbations on network robustness, and compare those to the impacts of topological perturbations on robustness. Meanwhile, the theoretical ranges of the allowed values of two eigenvector perturbation factors are derived in terms of the accurate reconstruction condition of networks, and validated by experimental simulations. By comparison our finding is that the eigenvector perturbations we define seem equivalent to topological perturbations.}}

The results show that the high clustering coefficient, short characteristic path length and large collection of reachable destinations of the Chinese ATMN can only emerge when several layers are merged together. Moreover, we compare two main types of layers corresponding to major and low-cost airlines. It is found that the small-world property and the rich-club effect of the Chinese ATMN are mainly caused by those layers corresponding to major airlines. Our work will highlight a better understanding of the Chinese air transportation network.}}

We show that considerable savings in computation time can be achieved by first filtering the input network based on correlations between cheap and more costly centrality metrics. Running the costly metric on the smaller resulting filtered network yields significant gains in computation time.

The impedance of the MCN film humidity sensor was varied by approximately three orders of magnitude in the RH range from 12% to 95% with a high level of linearity. The response and recovery times of the sensor were approximately 30 s and 50 s, respectively.

abstract = {Abstract The analysis of dynamics in traffic flow is an important step to achieve advanced traffic management and control in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Complexity and periodicity are definitely two fundamental properties in traffic dynamics. In this study, we first measure the complexity of traffic flow data by Lempel–Ziv algorithm at different temporal scales, and the data are collected from loop detectors on freeway. Second, to obtain more insight into the complexity and periodicity in traffic time series, we then construct complex networks from traffic time series by considering each day as a cycle and each cycle as a single node. The optimal threshold value of complex networks is estimated by the distribution of density and its derivative. In addition, the complex networks are subsequently analyzed in terms of some statistical properties, such as average path length, clustering coefficient, density, average degree and betweenness. Finally, take 2 min aggregation data as example, we use the correlation coefficient matrix, adjacent matrix and closeness to exploit the periodicity of weekdays and weekends in traffic flow data. The findings in this paper indicate that complex network is a practical tool for exploring dynamics in traffic time series.}}

In this paper, we present an effective control method based on adaptive PID neural network and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO algorithm is introduced to initialize the neural network for improving the convergent speed and preventing weights trapping into local optima. To adapt the initially uncertain and varying parameters in the control system, we introduce an improved gradient descent method to adjust the network parameters. The stability of our controller is analyzed according to the Lyapunov method. The simulation of complex nonlinear multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system is presented with strong coupling. Empirical results illustrate that the proposed controller can obtain good precision with shorter time compared with the other considered methods.}}

Motivated by the preservation of the scale-free property, thermodynamic stability and self-duality, we generalize the original extensive mapping of the BB fitness model by using the nonextensive Kaniadakis κ -distribution. Through numerical simulation and mean-field calculations we show that deviations from extensivity do not compromise qualitative features of the phase transition. Analysis of the critical temperature yields a monotonically decreasing dependence on the nonextensive parameter κ .}}

However, when the time scale of the measurement becomes larger than one month, we find that the modular structure from CC cannot correctly reflect the known industrial classification and their hierarchy. In addition the measured maximum modularity, Q m a x , for TE is always larger than that for CC, which indicates that TE is a better weight measure than CC for the system with asymmetric relationship.}}

The sampling coupled network is converted into an effective perturbed coupling network. The perturbations and nonlinearities of nodes are supposed to be influenced by some internal and external factors of networks, which are depended on the transmitted signals and restricted by some constant bounds respectively. An adaptive mechanism is designed to estimate the dependency rate of signals and constant bounds. Then the robust adaptive compensation controllers are constructed to automatically eliminate the effects of perturbations and nonlinearities based on the estimations, and simultaneously to specify the L 2 performance of networks. Through Lyapunov functions and adaptive schemes, the achievement of asymptotic synchronization of the closed-loop adaptive complex networks is obtained with satisfying a specified L 2 performance criterion. Finally, numerical simulations are included to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}}

Nevertheless, there are few studies where the core dimensions of resilience would have been studied in safety critical network activities. This paper claims that engineering resilience into a system is largely about steering the development of culture of the system towards better ability to anticipate, monitor, respond and learn. Thus, safety culture literature has relevance in resilience engineering field. This paper analyzes practical and theoretical challenges in applying the concept of safety culture in a complex, dynamic network of subcontractors involved in the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Finland, Olkiluoto 3. The concept of safety culture is in focus since it is widely used in nuclear industry and bridges the scientific and practical interests. This paper approaches subcontractor networks as complex systems. However, the management model of the Olkiluoto 3 project is to a large degree a traditional top-down hierarchy, which creates a mismatch between the management approach and the characteristics of the system to be managed. New insights were drawn from network governance studies.}}

An interesting possibility emerged that a network could be synchronized by both negative and positive feedback control simultaneously. By bridging synchronizability and synchronizing response speeds with a settling time index, we have developed timed synchronized region (TSR) as a substitute for the classical synchronized region to study finite time synchronization. As for the last condition, a graphical method was developed to estimate control gain with the minimum synchronization time (CGMST). Each condition has examples provided for illustration and verification.}}

abstract = {Abstract Typically, contagion strength is modeled by a transmission rate λ , whereby all nodes in a network are treated uniformly in a mean-field approximation. However, local agents react differently to the same contagion based on their local characteristics. Following our recent work (Montakhab and Manshour, 2012 [42]), we investigate contagion spreading models with local dynamics on complex networks. We therefore quantify contagions by their quality, 0 ⩽ alpha ⩽ 1 , and follow their spreading as their transmission condition (fitness) is evaluated by local agents. Instead of considering stochastic dynamics, here we consider various deterministic local rules. We find that initial spreading with exponential quality-dependent time scales is followed by a stationary state with a prevalence depending on the quality of the contagion. We also observe various interesting phenomena, for example, high prevalence without the participation of the hubs. This special feature of our "threshold rule" provides a mechanism for high prevalence spreading without the participation of "super-spreaders", in sharp contrast with many standard mechanism of spreading where hubs are believed to play the central role. On the other hand, if local nodes act as agents who stop the transmission once a threshold is reached, we find that spreading is severely hindered in a heterogeneous population while in a homogeneous one significant spreading may occur. We further decouple local characteristics from underlying topology in order to study the role of network topology in various models and find that as long as small-world effect exists, the underlying topology does not contribute to the final stationary state but only affects the initial spreading velocity.}}

In this context, the robustness of network infrastructures, e.g. air transport networks, are a central issue in transport geography. Disruption of communication links by intentional causes (e.g., terrorist attack on an airport) or unintentional (e.g., weather inclemency) could be crucial for countries, regions and even the airlines affected themselves. Policymakers and the management of airlines and alliances should be able to reduce the effects of such interruptions in order to ensure good communication through air transport (i.e., maximize the robustness of their network at a reasonable cost). The literature review of the study of air transport route networks through an analysis of complex networks has highlighted a lack of contributions to the study of the topology and the robustness of such networks which contrasts, with advances undertaken for other transport networks or communication systems. This survey suggests areas in which research should be undertaken, based on the existing literature in other areas and from three different perspectives: global route networks, airline alliances, airlines and airports so as to help towards a better understanding of air traffic and, therefore, to be able to assess the potential damage of any airport being inoperative for a continent, country or airline.}}

We justify the importance of the widespread coupled oscillator model as a locally canonical model and describe some selected applications relevant to control scientists, including vehicle coordination, electric power networks, and clock synchronization. We introduce the reader to several synchronization notions and performance estimates. We propose analysis approaches to phase and frequency synchronization, phase balancing, pattern formation, and partial synchronization. We present the sharpest known results about synchronization in networks of homogeneous and heterogeneous oscillators, with complete or sparse interconnection topologies, and in finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings.

TOPSIS as a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) technique has been an important branch of decision making since then. In addition, TOPSIS is first applied to identify influential nodes in a complex network in this open issue. In different types of networks in which the information goes by different ways, we consider several different centrality measures as the multi-attribute of complex network in TOPSIS application. TOPSIS is utilized to aggregate the multi-attribute to obtain the evaluation of node importance of each node. It is not limited to only one centrality measure, but considers different centrality measures, because every centrality measure has its own disadvantage and limitation. Then, we use the Susceptible–Infected (SI) model to evaluate the performance. Numerical examples are given to show the efficiency and practicability of the proposed method.}}

Taking IEEE 300 power grid with line capacity set proportional to tolerant parameter tp as example, the results show that there exists a critical node attack intensity A I = 0.147 , above which the three models produce almost identical topology-based vulnerability results under each attack strategy at any t p ⩾ 1 , while producing identical flow-based vulnerability results from PTM and DCPFM occurs at A I &gt; 0.147 , and A I &gt; 0.73 for BBM and DCPFM, which indicates that the PTM can better approach the DCPFM for flow-based vulnerability analysis under intentional attacks. Similar results are also found for intentional edge attacks and other power grids.}}

abstract = {Abstract Ranking nodes by their spreading ability in complex networks is a fundamental problem which relates to wide applications. Local metric like degree centrality is simple but less effective. Global metrics such as betweenness and closeness centrality perform well in ranking nodes, but are of high computational complexity. Recently, to rank nodes effectively and efficiently, a semi-local centrality measure has been proposed as a tradeoff between local and global metrics. However, in semi-local centrality, only the number of the nearest and the next nearest neighbors of a node is taken into account, while the topological connections among the neighbors are neglected. In this paper, we propose a local structural centrality measure which considers both the number and the topological connections of the neighbors of a node. To evaluate the performance of our method, we use the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model to simulate the epidemic spreading process on both artificial and real networks. By measuring the rank correlation between the ranked list generated by simulation results and the ones generated by centrality measures, we show that our method can rank the spreading ability of nodes more accurately than centrality measures such as degree, k -shell, betweenness, closeness and local centrality. Further, we show that our method can better distinguish the spreading ability of nodes.}}

What's more, when such a disaster happens, it can spread in a wide range with ubiquitous presence of a large-scale networked system. Therefore, the emergency/disaster management faces new challenges that the decision-makers have extra difficulties in perceiving the disaster dynamic spreading processes under this networked environment. This study tries to use the complex networks theory to tackle this complexity and the result shows the theory is a promising approach to support disaster/emergency management by focusing on simulation experiments of small world networks and scale free networks. The theory can be used to capture and describe the evolution mechanism, evolution discipline and overall behavior of a networked system. In particular, the complex networks theory is very strong at analyzing the complexity and dynamical changes of a networked system, which can improve the situation awareness after a disaster has occurred and help perceive its dynamic process, which is very important for high-quality decision making. In addition, this study also shows the use of the complex networks theory can build a visualized process to track the dynamic spreading of a disaster in a networked system.}}

In general, a complex network is considered as a graph of real world phenomena such as biological networks, ecological networks, technological networks, information networks and particularly social networks. Recently, major studies are reported for the characterization of social networks due to a growing trend in analysis of online social networks as dynamic complex large-scale graphs. Due to the large scale and limited access of real networks, the network model is characterized using an appropriate part of a network by sampling approaches. In this paper, a new sampling algorithm based on distributed learning automata has been proposed for sampling from complex networks. In the proposed algorithm, a set of distributed learning automata cooperate with each other in order to take appropriate samples from the given network. To investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm, several simulation experiments are conducted on well-known complex networks. Experimental results are compared with several sampling methods in terms of different measures. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the others.}}

Explicit equations for the time evolution of the total number of nodes and for the relative node frequencies are given. It is shown that, in the continuous limit, the master equation reduces to a Fokker–Planck equation (FPE). The basic dynamical function for its stationary solution is the ratio between its drift and diffusion coefficients. When this ratio is approximated by partial fractions (Padé's approximants), a hierarchy of stationary solutions of the FPE is obtained analytically, which are expressed as an exponential times the product of powers of monomials and binomials. It is also shown that if the difference between birth and death transition probabilities goes asymptotically to zero, the exponential factor in the solution is absent. Fits to real complex network probability distribution functions are shown. Comparison with rank-ordered data shows that, in general, the value of this exponential factor is close to unity, evidencing crossovers among power-law scale invariant regimes which might be associated to an underlying criticality and are related to a generalization of the beta distribution. The time dependent solution is also obtained analytically in terms of hyper-geometric functions. It is also shown that the FPE has similarity solutions. The limitations of the approach here presented are also discussed.}}

abstract = {Abstract Interacting with the pre-existing natural fractures, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing along horizontal wells creates complex fracture networks in the reservoirs. The flow behavior of these created networks is significantly different from that of traditional single or multiple planar fractures due to complex interplay of flow caused by the interconnected fractures. Therefore, modelling the flow behavior of such fracture networks is essential if one intends to evaluate well performance or characterize fracture properties. In this paper, we present a semi-analytical model for the transient behavior of complex fracture networks in which hydraulic and natural fractures can interconnect with arbitrary angles. To model the flow behavior more rigorously, the fractures within the network are represented explicitly rather than idealized as dual-porosity media with the matrix around them. This approach allows us to concentrate on the details of network properties, especially for the complex geometry and varying conductivity within the fracture. In the model, the transient responses are obtained from coupling a reservoir flow model and a fracture network flow model dynamically. Source functions in Laplace domain and superposition principle are adopted to model the flow behavior in reservoir analytically and the transient flow equation in the network is solved by finite difference method numerically. Furthermore, Star-Delta transformation commonly used in discrete fracture network simulation (DFN) is adopted to solve the interplay of flow between the interconnected fractures. The validation of the semi-analytical model is demonstrated in comparison to the solution of ECLIPSE reservoir simulator for orthogonal network. The parameter analysis indicates that the planar penetration coefficient of natural fractures and the varying fracture conductivity have a great effect on the transient responses and drainage pattern for orthogonal networks. Finally, a field example from the Barnett Shale shows the capacity and practical use of the semi-analytical model to evaluate well performance and stimulation effectiveness of complex fracture networks in unconventional reservoirs.}}

This paper investigates the properties of v / c in complex small-world and scale-free networks by introducing the congestion effects, described by link cost functions. The relationship between v / c and the degree of the node is mainly discussed. Finally, a simple strategy is presented to balance the tradeoff between traffic congestion and a waste of capacity.}}

Furthermore, the dynamic behaviors of the controlled system can also be changed by choosing appropriate control parameters.

Otherwise, the disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable and in the meantime there exists uniquely an endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable. A series of numerical experiments are given to illustrate the theoretical results. We also consider the SIRS model in the clustered scale-free networks to examine the effect of network community structure on the epidemic dynamics.}}

Recent studies have proved that the whole network can be sufficiently steered by injecting control signals into a minimum set of driver nodes, and the minimum numbers of driver nodes for many real networks are high, indicating that it is difficult to control them. For some large natural and technological networks, it is impossible and not feasible to control the full network. For example, in biological networks like large-scale gene regulatory networks it is impossible to control all the genes. This prompts us to explore the question how to choose partial networks that are easy for controlling and important in networked systems. In this work, we propose a method to achieve this goal. By computing the minimum driver nodes densities of the partial networks of Erdös–Rényi (ER) networks, scale-free (SF) networks and 23 real networks, we find that our method performs better than random method that chooses nodes randomly. Moreover, we find that the nodes chosen by our method tend to be the essential elements of the whole systems, via studying the nodes chosen by our method of a real human signaling network and a human protein interaction network and discovering that the chosen nodes from these networks tend to be cancer-associated genes. The implementation of our method shows some interesting connections between the structure and the controllability of networks, improving our understanding of the control principles of complex systems.}}

Here, by developing a series of algorithms, this study provided a whole anatomical neural network of the macaque monkey.

Results revealed that the areas including the striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, prefrontal lobe, thalamus, hippocampus, visual cortex, insula, etc., showed relatively notable drifts in their own patterns. The present study also demonstrated that the current targets of DBS shared a common feature: their centrality values being relatively low in the normal brain while intensely drifting with PD.}}

The presented algorithms have a number of advantages over other traditional mesh-based methods such as reduction of the computational cost, speed up of the execution time, and data integration with the a priori knowledge. Furthermore, the presented techniques are applicable when the differential equations governing a system or dynamic engineering process are not fully understood. The proposed algorithms learn to compute the unknown or free parameters of the equation from observations of the process behavior, hence a more precise theoretical description of the process is obtained.

Recent studies of layered models have shown that individuals belonging to many different networks can affect the spreading process on one network. In this paper, we take this phenomenon into consideration and discuss its influence on rumor diffusion in complex networks by introducing independent spreaders. Independent spreaders are nodes that know the rumor from other channels rather than their neighbors. A new stochastic technique is used to obtain the dynamics of rumor diffusion. Results reveal that independent spreaders boost the process by bringing the rumor to regions remote from current spreaders. In order to accelerate diffusion, we find that improving the network connectivity is more efficient than adding more independent spreaders.}}

To investigate its complex regulation process, the RNA-Seq study of rice embryo was conducted at three time points of 0, 12 and 48 h post imbibition (HPI). Dynamic transcriptional alterations were observed, especially in the early stage (0–12 HPI). Seed related genes, especially those encoding desiccation inducible proteins and storage reserves in embryo, decreased drastically after imbibition. The expression profiles of phytohormone related genes indicated distinct roles of abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroid (BR) in germination. Moreover, network analysis revealed the importance of protein phosphorylation in phytohormone interactions. Network and gene ontology (GO) analyses suggested that transcription factors (TFs) played a regulatory role in functional transitions during germination, and the enriched TF families at 0 HPI implied a regulation of epigenetic modification in dry seeds. In addition, 35 germination-specific TF genes in embryo were identified and seven genes were verified by qRT-PCR. Besides, enriched TF binding sites (TFBSs) supported physiological changes in germination. Overall, this study expands our comprehensive knowledge of multiple regulation factors underlying rice seed germination.}}

These are of value in various applications, especially in the case of large social and information networks. However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also discuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks.}}

Especially, research on biological networks like functional spatiotemporal brain activations and changes, caused by neuropsychiatric pathologies, is promising. Analyzing those so-called complex networks, the calculation of meaningful measures can be very long-winded depending on their size and structure. Even worse, in many labs only standard desktop computers are accessible to perform those calculations. Numerous investigations on complex networks regard huge but sparsely connected network structures, where most network nodes are connected to only a few others. Currently, there are several libraries available to tackle this kind of networks. A problem arises when not only a few big and sparse networks have to be analyzed, but hundreds or thousands of smaller and conceivably dense networks (e.g. in measuring brain activation over time). Then every minute per network is crucial. For these cases there several possibilities to use standard hardware more efficiently. It is not sufficient to apply just standard algorithms for dense graph characteristics. This article introduces the new library FALCON developed especially for the exploration of dense complex networks. Currently, it offers 12 different measures (like clustering coefficients), each for undirected-unweighted, undirected-weighted and directed-unweighted networks. It uses a multi-core approach in combination with comprehensive code and hardware optimizations. There is an alternative massively parallel GPU implementation for the most time-consuming measures, too. Finally, a comparing benchmark is integrated to support the choice of the most suitable library for a particular network issue.}}

The k-shell index, which is the topological location of a node in a network, is a more efficient measure at capturing the spreading ability of a node than are the degree and betweenness centralities. However, the k-shell decomposition fails to yield the monotonic ranking of spreaders because it assigns too many nodes with the same k-shell index. In this paper, we propose a novel measure, coreness centrality, to estimate the spreading influence of a node in a network using the k-shell indices of its neighbors. Our experimental results on both real and artificial networks, compared with an epidemic spreading model, show that the proposed method can quantify the node influence more accurately and provide a more monotonic ranking list than other ranking methods.}}

But how effective are these models to capture their real performance response is still a question worthy of research. Taking the Chinese railway system as an example, this paper selects three typical complex network based models, including purely topological model (PTM), purely shortest path model (PSPM), and weight (link length) based shortest path model (WBSPM), to analyze railway accessibility and flow-based vulnerability and compare their results with those from the real train flow model (RTFM). The results show that the WBSPM can produce the train routines with 83% stations and 77% railway links identical to the real routines and can approach the RTFM the best for railway vulnerability under both single and multiple component failures. The correlation coefficient for accessibility vulnerability from WBSPM and RTFM under single station failures is 0.96 while it is 0.92 for flow-based vulnerability; under multiple station failures, where each station has the same failure probability fp, the WBSPM can produce almost identical vulnerability results with those from the RTFM under almost all failures scenarios when fp is larger than 0.62 for accessibility vulnerability and 0.86 for flow-based vulnerability.}}

Most previous studies are mainly focused on the analysis based on the random walk strategy, whose entropy rate is bounded by the logarithm of the largest node degree of a given graph. In this paper, we take into account a novel strategy named Lévy walk and derive the general expression of entropy rate of Lévy walk on networks. We present numerical evidences for how the Lévy walk strategy delivers an efficient diffusion process on networks and significantly increases the entropy rate compared with the random walk strategy. It is further demonstrated that the capability of Lévy walk heavily relies on the network topology as well as the amount of information available regarding the network structure. Specifically, the behavior of Lévy walk is highly sensitive to the distribution of shortest distances of the network and its variation. To address this finding, we thereby give a theoretical explanation of the relationship between the variation of shortest distances and the entropy rate of Lévy walk. This work may help to enrich our understanding of the behavior of Lévy walk and further guide us to find an efficient diffusion process on networks.}}

Then, we evaluate the properties of each node from the resulting networks by calculating the cumulative distribution of characteristic parameters such as degree, clustering coefficient, etc. Based on the maximum vertical distance of each pair of distributions, global similarity testing methods are proposed with consideration of the inhomogeneity of parameter distributions and the scale of the networks. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the strategy in terms of robustness and topological information mining. The methodology described here can be applied to the identification of physical designs of circuits that may contain suspected patent infringement, and it is suitable for a wide range of circuits and systems.}}

P d reflects the interactive effect between the weight fluctuation and variation of nodes and links (topological structure) for each real network. For airport networks the exponent β is 0.4 and the creation probability P d is equal to 0.018 (China), 0.025 (US), 0.03 (Brazil) and 0.04 (Europe).

The energy international trade network is formed through the energy imports and exports among countries. From the characteristics of the network we can know the changes in energy trade patterns. According to the international energy trade data which include crude oil, coal and natural gas data published by The United Nations Statistics Division from 1996 to 2012, with the state as the node and the energy flows of trade for the side, this article constructed directed energy international trade complex network with out-weighted edges. This article calculated such complex network properties as node degree, network structure entropy, average clustering coefficient, and average nearest neighbor degree of the energy international trade complex network. Based on these characteristics, this article analyzed the degree distribution, heterogeneity, clustering, and vertex intensity correlation of the energy international trade complex network. We find that countries increased tightness and strengthened interdependence when they carry out the international energy trade. Transportation costs and customs tax, etc. will not have much impact on the import and export of fossil fuels. It will be more frequently trading with each other among countries' partner who have smaller population or lower economic strength. Small countries tend to make energy trade relations with regional hubs in local area. Global trading countries have a lot of partners around the world. If energy war, crisis or other issues occur in these countries, it is likely to spread to other countries, so that the global fossil energy trade will be affected.}}

However, the sheer sizes of large-scale networks have been the main hurdle in such analysis and applications. Recently, a coarse graining scheme based on network synchronization was proposed to reduce the network size while preserving the synchronizability of the original network. In this research, we investigate the effects of the coarse graining process on synchronizability over complex clustered networks. Numerous experiments demonstrate a close correlation between the degree of clustering of the initial network and the ability of spectral coarse graining in preserving the network synchronizability. It is found that synchronizability can be well preserved after applying the spectral coarse graining if the considered network has a clear cluster structure, whereas this is not so for networks with vague clustering. Since most real-world networks have prominent cluster structures, this research provides new insights into understanding large-scale dynamical networks and analyzing their complex topological characteristics as well as synchronization mechanisms.}}

This paper proposes an alternative OWD model that adds a systemic approach, by using Bayesian networks algorithms to discover a directed two level network of variables nested in subnetworks of determinants. The network was inferred by using subsamples of the 2013 version of the American Community Survey. Network analysis methods applied to the model provided new insights concerning single ODW relevance and the roles that are useful to focus selective welfare interventions; they also offered a big picture that is fundamental to reason about the unpremeditated universal character of the selective US welfare policies.}}

abstract = {Abstract Society is now, more than ever, highly dependent on the large-scale networks that underpin its functions. In relatively recent times, significant failures have occurred on large-scale networks that have a considerable impact upon sizable proportions of the world's inhabitants. The failure of infrastructure has, in turn, begot a subsequent loss of services supported by that network. Consequently, it is now vitally important to evaluate the robustness of such networks in terms of the services supported by the network in question. Evaluating network robustness is integral to service provisioning and thus any network should include explicit indication of the impact upon service performance. Traditionally, network robustness metrics focused solely on topological characteristics, although some new approaches have considered, to a degree, the services supported by such networks. Several shortcomings of these new metrics have been identified. With the purpose of solving the drawbacks of these metrics, this paper presents a new measure called endurance, which quantifies the level of robustness supported by a specific topology under different types of multiple failure scenarios, giving higher importance to perturbations affecting low percentages of elements of a network. In this paper, endurance of six synthetic complex networks is computed for a range of defined multiple failure scenarios, taking into account the connection requests that cannot be satisfied. It is demonstrated that our proposal is able to quantify the robustness of a network under given multiple failure scenarios. Finally, results show that different types of networks react differently depending on the type of multiple failure.}}

Six network performance metrics, including four new metrics, are applied to quantify networks' diffusion speed, diffusion scale, homogeneity, and diameter. In order to efficiently identify nodes whose removal maximally destroys a network, i.e., minimizes network performance, ten structured heuristic node removal strategies are designed using different node centrality metrics including degree, betweenness, reciprocal closeness, complement-derived closeness, and eigenvector centrality. These strategies are applied to remove nodes from the September 11, 2001 hijackers' network, and their performance are compared to that of a random strategy, which removes randomly selected nodes, and the locally optimal solution (LOS), which removes nodes to minimize network performance at each step. The computational complexity of the 11 strategies and LOS is also analyzed. Results show that the node removal strategies using degree and betweenness centralities are more efficient than other strategies.}}

We examine the effect of different topologies and connection delays on the hyperexcitability phenomenon in networks having recurrent synaptic AMPA (fast) excitation (in the absence of synaptic inhibition) and demonstrate the emergence of additional time scales.}}

A novel lemma on exponential stability of impulsive delayed differential equations was established, in which the impulsive functions exhibit multiple time-varying delays. By utilizing the proposed lemma, Lyapunov functions, the stochastic analysis techniques, and the Kronecker product, general criteria ensuring global exponential synchronization in mean square of the addressed TS fuzzy complex networks are obtained. Moreover, the theory of function minimum value is utilized to reduce the conservativeness of the obtained synchronization criteria, which also makes them simple and easy to be verified in practical applications. Results of this paper improve and extend some existing ones.

abstract = {Abstract The quest for a model that is able to explain, describe, analyze and simulate real-world complex networks is of uttermost practical, as well as theoretical, interest. In fact, networks can be a natural way to represent many phenomena; often, they arise from a complex interweaving of some features of the nodes. For example, in a co-authorship network, a link stems more easily between authors with similar interests; similarly, in a genetic regulatory network, links are affected by the different biological functions of the regulators. In this paper we introduce and study a novel network model that is based on a latent attribute structure: this model, inspired by a generalization of the Indian Buffet process, is simple and contains a small number of parameters, with a clear and intuitive role. Each node is characterized by a number of features and the probability of the existence of an edge between two nodes depends on the features they share; the number of possible features is not fixed a priori and can grow indefinitely. Moreover, a random fitness parameter is introduced for each node in order to determine its ability to transmit its own features to other nodes; this behavior is added on top of a process of Indian-Buffet type. Because of the fitness property, a node's connectivity does not depend on its age alone, so that also "young but fit" nodes are able to compete and succeed in propagating their features and acquiring links. We also show how, considering the resulting bipartite node-attribute network, it is possible to gain some insight about which nodes were originally the most "fit". Our model for this bipartite network depends on few parameters, that are characterized by their straightforward interpretation and by the availability of proper estimators. Even if the parameters are easy to interpret and tune, the model is general enough to represent complex phenomena—e.g., homophily, heterophily, or any interplay between features. We provide some theoretical as well as experimental results regarding the power-law behavior of the model and the proposed tools for the estimation of the parameters. We also show, through a number of experiments, how the proposed model naturally captures most local and global properties (e.g., degree distributions, connectivity and distance distributions) real networks exhibit.}}

However, current approaches are often constrained by the availability of required data, and may not be able to incorporate the many varied factors that influence this risk. Systems models, based on Bayesian networks (BNs), are emerging as an effective complementary approach that overcomes these limitations. Objectives This article aims to provide a comparative evaluation of the capabilities and challenges of current QMRA methods and BN models, and a scoping review of recent published articles that adopt the latter for microbial risk assessment. Pros and cons of systems approaches in this context are distilled and discussed. Methods A search of the peer-reviewed literature revealed 15 articles describing BNs used in the context of QMRAs for foodborne and waterborne pathogens. These studies were analysed in terms of their application, uses and benefits in QMRA. Discussion The applications were notable in their diversity. BNs were used to make predictions, for scenario assessment, risk minimisation, to reduce uncertainty and to separate uncertainty and variability. Most studies focused on a segment of the exposure pathway, indicating the broad potential for the method in other QMRA steps. BNs offer a number of useful features to enhance QMRA, including transparency, and the ability to deal with poor quality data and support causal reasoning. Conclusion The method has significant untapped potential to describe the complex relationships between microbial environmental exposures and health.}}

In this paper, we have demonstrated the occurrence of multi-stable states in a system of identical phase oscillators that are dynamically coupled. We find that the multi-stable state is comprised of a two cluster synchronization state where the clusters are in anti-phase relationship with each other and a desynchronization state. We also find that the phase relationship between the oscillators is asymptotically stable irrespective of whether there is synchronization or desynchronization in the system. The time scale of the coupling affects the size of the clusters in the two cluster state. We also investigate the effect of both the coupling asymmetry and plasticity asymmetry on the multi-stable states. In the absence of coupling asymmetry, increasing the plasticity asymmetry causes the system to go from a two clustered state to a desynchronization state and then to a two clustered state. Further, the coupling asymmetry, if present, also affects this transition. We also analytically find the occurrence of the above mentioned multi-stable–desynchronization–multi-stable state transition. A brief discussion on the phase evolution of nonidentical oscillators is also provided. Our analytical results are in good agreement with our numerical observations.}}

Rather than the common Lipschitz-type function, a more general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to characterize the nonlinearities in the networks. The purpose of the addressed H infinity state estimation problem is to design a state estimator such that, for all admissible nonlinear disturbances, missing measurements as well as coupling delays, the dynamics of the augmented systems is guaranteed to be exponentially mean-square stable and attenuated to a given H infinity performance level. By constructing a novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and utilizing convex optimization method as well as Kronecker product, we derive the sufficient conditions under which the desired state estimator exists.

On a macroeconomic level, developing countries are increasing production; while on a microeconomic level, speculative traders are becoming more involved in the market. Agricultural products have a diverse array of factors that can affect the price (i.e. political, government, population, weather, supply and demand). Commodity prices can suffer from extreme volatility in the short term, changing as much as 50% in one year. This research uses the soybean crush spread as a model. The soybean complex adds an interesting component as the underlying soybean product can be crushed into soymeal and soy oil. All three products (soybeans, soymeal, and soy oil) currently have contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The crush margin represents the profit margin a processor will receive from crushing the soybeans into the underlying products (soymeal and soy oil). This research adds to the literature of agricultural price forecasting models, using artificial intelligence and nonlinear modeling. The performance of different neural network architectures and inputs to discover desirable returns for both speculative trading and hedging are investigated.}}

In this paper, we use complex network theory to study traffic time series, which provide a new insight into traffic flow analysis. Firstly, the phase space, which describes the evolution of the behavior of a nonlinear system, is reconstructed using the delay embedding theorem. Secondly, in order to convert the new time series into a complex network, the critical threshold is estimated by the characteristics of a complex network, which include degree distribution, cumulative degree distribution, and density and clustering coefficients. We find that the degree distribution of associated complex network can be fitted with a Gaussian function, and the cumulative degree distribution can be fitted with an exponential function. Density and clustering coefficients are then researched to reflect the change of connections between nodes in complex network, and the results are in accordance with the observation of the plot of an adjacent matrix. Consequently, based on complex network analysis, the proper range of the critical threshold is determined. Finally, to mine the nodes with the closest relations in a complex network, the modularity is calculated with the increase of critical threshold and the community structure is detected according to the optimal modularity. The work in our paper provides a new way to understand the dynamics of traffic time series.}}

For all other parameters, the heterogeneous networks are always highly vulnerable to the failure of high-degree nodes; this point is the same as in the structural robustness analysis. We also find that with random inactivation, heterogeneous networks are always more robust than the corresponding homogeneous networks with the same average degree except for one special parameter.

Extending previous methods to locally assess the symmetry of nodes is not straightforward.

We develop two topological transformations that allow a concise characterization of the different types of symmetry appearing on networks and apply these concepts to six network models, namely the Erdős–Rényi, Barabási–Albert, random geometric graph, Waxman, Voronoi and rewired Voronoi. Real-world networks, namely the scientific areas of Wikipedia, the world-wide airport network and the street networks of Oldenburg and San Joaquin, are also analyzed in terms of the proposed symmetry measurements. Several interesting results emerge from this analysis, including the high symmetry exhibited by the Erdős–Rényi model. Additionally, we found that the proposed measurements present low correlation with other traditional metrics, such as node degree and betweenness centrality. Principal component analysis is used to combine all the results, revealing that the concepts presented here have substantial potential to also characterize networks at a global scale. We also provide a real-world application to the financial market network.}}

In our study, we analyze the potential impact of carpooling as a collective phenomenon emerging from people׳s mobility, by network analytics. Based on big mobility data from travelers in a given territory, we construct the network of potential carpooling, where nodes correspond to the users and links to possible shared trips, and analyze the structural and topological properties of this network, such as network communities and node ranking, to the purpose of highlighting the subpopulations with higher chances to create a carpooling community, and the propensity of users to be either drivers or passengers in a shared car. Our study is anchored to reality thanks to a large mobility dataset, consisting of the complete one-month-long GPS trajectories of approx. 10% circulating cars in Tuscany. We also analyze the aggregated outcome of carpooling by means of empirical simulations, showing how an assignment policy exploiting the network analytic concepts of communities and node rankings minimizes the number of single occupancy vehicles observed after carpooling.}}

abstract = {Abstract Recently, many network-based methods have been developed and successfully applied to cluster data. Once the underlying network has been constructed, a clustering method can be applied over its vertices and edges. In this paper, the concept of pinning control in complex networks is applied to cluster data. Firstly, an adaptive method for constructing sparse and connected networks is proposed. Secondly, a dissimilarity measure is computed via a dynamic system in which vertices are expected to reach a consensus state regarding a reference trajectory. The reference is forced into the system by pinning control. A theoretical analysis was carried out to prove the convergence of the dynamic system under certain parameter constraints. The results using real data sets have showed that the proposed method performs well in the presence of clusters with different sizes and shapes comparing to some well-known clustering methods.}}

The regulatory mechanism behind respective miRNA patterns is only partially understood. Moreover, "preserved" miRNAs, i.e., miRNAs that are not dysregulated in any disease, and their biological impact have been explored to a very limited extent. We set out to systematically determine their role in regulatory networks by defining groups of highly-dysregulated miRNAs that contribute to a disease signature as opposed to preserved housekeeping miRNAs. We further determined preferential targets and pathways of both dysregulated and preserved miRNAs by computing multi-layer networks, which were compared between housekeeping and dysregulated miRNAs. Of 848 miRNAs examined across 1049 blood samples, 8 potential housekeepers showed very limited expression variations, while 20 miRNAs showed highly-dysregulated expression throughout the investigated blood samples. Our approach provides important insights into miRNAs and their role in regulatory networks. The methodology can be applied to systematically investigate the differences in target genes and pathways of arbitrary miRNA sets.}}

Promptly identifying bank distress and contagion issues is of great importance to the regulators. This paper proposes a methodology that can be used additionally to the standard methods of bank supervision or the new ones proposed to be implemented. By this, one can reveal the degree of banks' connectedness and thus identify "core" instead of just "big" banks. Core banks are central in the network in the sense that they are shown to be crucial for network supervision. Core banks can be used as gauges of bank distress over a sub-network and promptly raise a red flag so that the central bank can effectively and swiftly focus on the corresponding neighborhood of financial institutions. In this paper we demonstrate the proposed scheme using as an example the asset returns variable. The method may and should be used with alternative variables as well.}}

In this paper, we contribute to the endeavor of developing such a reference dataset, and present original synthetic traces that are generated from high-resolution real-world traffic counts. They describe road traffic in quasi-stationary state on three highways near Madrid, Spain, for different time-spans of several working days. To assess the potential impact of the traces on networking studies, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of the vehicular network topology they yield.

Materials and Methods Study participants included 233 women and 191 men with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome or chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome in a multicenter study. They completed a battery of measures, including items asking whether pain worsened with bladder filling (painful filling) or whether the urge to urinate was due to pain, pressure or discomfort (painful urgency). Participants were categorized into 3 groups, including group 1—painful filling and painful urgency (both), 2—painful filling or painful urgency (either) and 3—no painful filling or painful urgency (neither). Results Of the men 75% and of the women 88% were categorized as both or either. These bladder characteristics were associated with more severe urological symptoms (increased pain, frequency and urgency), a higher somatic symptom burden, depression and worse quality of life (3-group trend test each p &lt;0.01). A gradient effect was observed across the groups (both &gt; either &gt; neither). Compared to those in the neither group men categorized as both or either reported more frequent urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome symptom flares, catastrophizing and irritable bowel syndrome, and women categorized as both or either were more likely to have a negative affect and chronic fatigue syndrome. Conclusions Men and women with bladder symptoms characterized as painful filling or painful urgency had more severe urological symptoms, more generalized symptoms and worse quality of life than participants who reported neither characteristic, suggesting that these symptom characteristics might represent important subsets of patients with urological chronic pelvic pain syndromes.}}

The obtained result implies that the network will achieve exponential synchronization for appropriate communication delays if the network's weighted adjacency matrix is of scrambling property and the coupling strength is large enough. Note that, our synchronization condition is very new, which would be easy to check in comparison with those previously reported LMIs. Moreover, we extend the result to the case when the interaction topology is switching. The maximal allowable upper bounds of communication delays are obtained in each case.

Increasing either average node degree or homogeneity of degree distribution will facilitate epidemic spreading. When packet generation rate ρ is small, increasing ρ favors epidemic spreading. However, when ρ is large enough, traffic congestion appears which inhibits epidemic spreading.}}

During the ant colony search, the method uses a new fitness function to percept local environment and employs a pheromone diffusion model as a global information feedback mechanism to realize information exchange among ants. A significant advantage of our method is that the locations in the grid environment and the connections of the complex network structure are simultaneously taken into account in ants moving. Experimental results on computer-generated and real-world networks show the capability of our method to successfully detect community structures.}}

It can be found in various disciplines of the social sciences, most notably in political science, psychology, and communication research. Due to the fuzzy nature of frames, identifying them has proven to be quite complex. Here, we perform framing analysis on a corpus of news texts on the population and family planning issue in the Philippines by operating two varying approaches: human-based and computer-assisted. A singular holistic approach to framing is initially implemented where coders/domain experts classify each news text to a specific pre-defined frame. This traditional approach is known to raise serious issues on the reliability and validity of the results mainly due to human's intrinsic biases. To address such issues, we propose a novel technique that synergically combines the method of Matthes and Kohring (2008) and complex networks approach. In our model, the codings of texts are cast as a network of content analytic variables (CAVs). Our proposed method tackles the clustering issue that MK raised, which plagues framing scholars in the quantitative identification of news frames in texts. Moreover, the research is significant on a societal level as it also aims to gain perspective for reasons on the lack of progress in discussions about suitable population policies in most developing countries like the Philippines.}}

However it has now been recognized that many real-networks, such as power grids, transportation systems, and communication infrastructures interact and depend on other networks. Here, we will present a review of the framework developed in recent years for studying the vulnerability and recovery of networks composed of interdependent networks. In interdependent networks, when nodes in one network fail, they cause dependent nodes in other networks to also fail. This is also the case when some nodes, like for example certain people, play a role in two networks, i.e. in a multiplex. Dependency relations may act recursively and can lead to cascades of failures concluding in sudden fragmentation of the system. We review the analytical solutions for the critical threshold and the giant component of a network of n interdependent networks. The general theory and behavior of interdependent networks has many novel features that are not present in classical network theory. Interdependent networks embedded in space are significantly more vulnerable compared to non-embedded networks. In particular, small localized attacks may lead to cascading failures and catastrophic consequences. Finally, when recovery of components is possible, global spontaneous recovery of the networks and hysteresis phenomena occur. The theory developed for this process points to an optimal repairing strategy for a network of networks. Understanding realistic effects present in networks of networks is required in order to move towards determining system vulnerability.}}

Examples include biochemical, pharmacokinetic, epidemiological, ecological, social, neural, and multi-agent networks. A common approach to modeling such networks is by a master equation that governs the dynamic evolution of the joint probability mass function of the underlying population process and naturally leads to Markovian dynamics for such process. Due however to the nonlinear nature of most reactions and the large size of the underlying state-spaces, computation and analysis of the resulting stochastic population dynamics is a difficult task. This review article provides a coherent and comprehensive coverage of recently developed approaches and methods to tackle this problem. After reviewing a general framework for modeling Markovian reaction networks and giving specific examples, the authors present numerical and computational techniques capable of evaluating or approximating the solution of the master equation, discuss a recently developed approach for studying the stationary behavior of Markovian reaction networks using a potential energy landscape perspective, and provide an introduction to the emerging theory of thermodynamic analysis of such networks. Three representative problems of opinion formation, transcription regulation, and neural network dynamics are used as illustrative examples.}}

Here we show that a MADS-box gene, XAANTAL2 (XAL2/AGL14), is necessary and sufficient to induce flowering, and its regulation is important in FM maintenance and determinacy. xal2 mutants are late flowering, particularly under short-day (SD) condition, while XAL2 overexpressing plants are early flowering, but their flowers have vegetative traits. Interestingly, inflorescences of the latter plants have higher expression levels of LFY, AP1, and TFL1 than wild-type plants. In addition we found that XAL2 is able to bind the TFL1 regulatory regions. On the other hand, the basipetal carpels of the 35S::XAL2 lines lose determinacy and maintain high levels of WUS expression under SD condition. To provide a mechanistic explanation for the complex roles of XAL2 in SAM transitions and the apparently paradoxical phenotypes of XAL2 and other MADS-box (SOC1, AGL24) overexpressors, we conducted dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN) and epigenetic landscape modeling. We uncovered a GRN module that underlies VM, IM, and FM gene configurations and transition patterns in wild-type plants as well as loss and gain of function lines characterized here and previously. Our approach thus provides a novel mechanistic framework for understanding the complex basis of SAM development.}}

abstract = {Abstract A growing number of systems are represented as networks whose architecture conveys significant information and determines many of their properties. Examples of network architecture include modular, bipartite, and core-periphery structures. However inferring the network structure is a non trivial task and can depend sometimes on the chosen null model. Here we propose a method for classifying network structures and ranking its nodes in a statistically well-grounded fashion. The method is based on the use of Belief Propagation for learning through Entropy Maximization on both the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and the degree-corrected Stochastic Block Model (dcSBM). As a specific application we show how the combined use of the two ensembles—SBM and dcSBM—allows to disentangle the bipartite and the core-periphery structure in the case of the e-MID interbank network. Specifically we find that, taking into account the degree, this interbank network is better described by a bipartite structure, while using the SBM the core-periphery structure emerges only when data are aggregated for more than a week.}}

Most contemporary community detection algorithms employs single optimization criteria (i.e.., modularity), which may not be adequate to represent the structures in complex networks. We suggest community detection process as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) for investigating the community structures in complex networks. To overcome the limitations of the community detection problem, we propose a new multi-objective optimization algorithm based on enhanced firefly algorithm so that a set of non-dominated (Pareto-optimal) solutions can be achieved. In our proposed algorithm, a new tuning parameter based on a chaotic mechanism and novel self-adaptive probabilistic mutation strategies are used to improve the overall performance of the algorithm. The experimental results on synthetic and real world complex networks suggest that the multi-objective community detection algorithm provides useful paradigm for discovering overlapping community structures robustly.}}

Thus, it is of interest to understand network-structural features whose presence enforces dull, stable behavior and whose absence permits the dynamical richness that might be necessary for life. We present conditions on a network's Species-Reaction Graph that ensure a high degree of stable behavior, so long as the kinetic rate functions satisfy certain weak and natural constraints. These graph-theoretical conditions are considerably more incisive than those reported earlier.}}

This method results in confusion over the invulnerability of various types of complex networks. By normalizing network performance and defining a baseline, this paper defines the invulnerability index as the integral of the normalized network performance curve minus the baseline. This quantitative method seeks to measure network invulnerability under both edge and node attacks and provides a definition on the distinguishment of the robustness and fragility of networks. To demonstrate the proposed method, three small-world networks were selected as test beds. The simulation results indicate that the proposed invulnerability index can effectively and accurately quantify network resilience and can deal with both the node and edge attacks. The index can provide a valuable reference for determining network invulnerability in future research.}}

We consider a simple distributed communication protocol, which is based on gossip and on the local knowledge each node has about resources hold by its neighbors. In particular, upon reception (or generation) of a novel query, a node relays the message to those neighbors that have resources whose profile matches the query. Moreover, the node gossips the query to other remaining neighbors, so that the query can be disseminated through the overlay. A mathematical analysis is provided to estimate the number of nodes receiving the query (and consequently, the portion of query hits), based on the network topology, resource availability and gossip probability. Results show that the use of unstructured networks, coupled with simple dissemination protocols, represent a viable approach to build P2P resource discovery systems.}}

All complexes were characterized by NMR in solution, vibrational spectroscopy, and by X-ray diffraction studies. The molecular structures of the complexes revealed different coordination patterns of the diamino ligands; L1 just displayed a κ2N mode meanwhile L2 exhibited a wide variety of patterns (κ2N, κNκS, and κ2NκS) forming chelate rings of five- or eight-members. The presence of N–H functions in the ligand moieties enhanced the formation of extended hydrogen-bond networks; these supramolecular arrangements were mainly discussed at unitary and binary levels and sorted according to the molecular coordination patterns observed.}}

Then two indicators, Model Bias and Model Accuracy, are proposed to assess the effectiveness of BN in model validation, ensuring the model predictions are not significantly different from the actual observations. Finally we extend the safety control process to the entire life cycle of risk-prone events in model application, rather than restricted to pre-accident control, but during-construction continuous and post-accident control are included. Adapting its reasoning features, including forward reasoning, importance analysis and background reasoning, decision makers are provided with systematic and effective support for safety control in the overall work process. A frequent safety problem, ground settlement during Wuhan Changjiang Metro Shield Tunnel Construction (WCMSTC), is taken as a case study. Results demonstrate the feasibility of BN model, as well as its application potential. The proposed model can be used by practitioners in the industry as a decision support tool to increase the likelihood of a successful project in complex environments.}}

Given a seismic data, the procedure of constructing an earthquake network proposed by Abe and Suzuki (2004) contains as a single parameter the size of the cells, into which a geographical region under consideration is divided. Then, the characteristics of the network depend on the cell size, in general. Here, the dependency of the clustering coefficient, C , of network on the cell size is studied. Remarkably, C of the earthquake networks constructed from the seismic data taken from California, Japan and Iran well coincide for each value of the rescaled dimensionless cell size. It is found that the networks in California and Japan are three-dimensional, whereas the one in Iran is rather two-dimensional. In addition, the values of C of all these three networks monotonically converge to C ≈ 0.85 as the dimensionless cell size becomes larger than a common value, highlighting a universal aspect of the concept of earthquake network. An implication of the result to understanding the physics of seismicity is discussed.}}

Based on the assumption that protein complexes are highly connected areas in PINs, many algorithms were proposed to identify protein complexes from PINs. However, most of these approaches neglected that not all proteins in complexes are highly connected, and proteins in PINs with different topological properties may form protein complexes in different ways and should be treated differently. In this paper, we proposed a double-layer clustering method based on the power-law distribution (PLCluster). To calculate the centrality scores of nodes, we proposed a Dense-Spread Centrality method. The centrality scores calculated by Dense-Spread Centrality method follow a power-law distribution. Based on the power-law distribution of the centrality scores, PLCluster divides the nodes into two categories: the nodes with very high centrality scores and the nodes with lower centrality scores. Then different strategies are applied to nodes in different categories for detecting protein complexes from the PIN, respectively. Furthermore, the predicted protein complexes, which are inconsistent with the fact that all proteins in a protein complex should be in the same subcellular compartment, are filtered out. Compared with other nine existing methods on a high reliable yeast PIN, PLCluster shows great advantages in terms of the number of known complexes that are identified, Sensitivity, Specificity, f-measure and the number of perfect matches.}}

Thirty-five volunteers were scanned with a 3 T MRI while they imagined a sequence of ankle movements (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, varus and valgus) before and after mental practice. Subjects were distributed in two groups: the first group executed regular movements whereas the second group made fast movements. We applied the general linear model (GLM) and model-free, exploratory tensorial independent component analytic (TICA) approaches to identify plastic post-training effects on brain activation. GLM showed that post-training imagination of movement was accompanied by a dual effect: a specific recruitment of a medial prefronto-cingulo-parietal circuit reminiscent of the default-mode network, with the left putamen, and a decreased activity of a lateral fronto-parietal network. Training-related subcortical changes only consisted in an increased activity in the left striatum. Unexpectedly, no difference was observed in the cerebellum. TICA also revealed involvement of the left executive network, and of the dorsal control executive network but no significant differences were found between pre- and post-training phases. Therefore, repetitive motor mental imagery induced specific putamen (motor rehearsal) recruitment that one previously observed during learning of overt movements, and, simultaneously, a specific shift of activity from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (attention, working memory) to the medial posterior parietal and cingulate cortices (mental imagery and memory rehearsal). Our data complement and confirm the notion that differential and coupled recruitment of cognitive networks can constitute a neural marker of training effects.}}

Analyzing regional metabolism within this network assists observers to understand the concept in a broader context. Some qualitative tools such as simple matrix operations have been adopted to explore such networks but related research is highly fragmented. Here the emphasis is put on a qualitative network model (QNM) that integrates the existing tools into a unified analytical framework. The tools in the QNM are organized into three levels: (1) dominance analysis focuses on how to measure the performance of each component of a network; (2) consistency analysis is used to test whether the interactions between network components are contradictory to the desired development direction for regional metabolism; and (3) sustainability analysis returns three sustainability benchmarks for regional metabolism. With the aid of these tools, QNM can comprehensively explore such networks from multiple perspectives. To test the QNM construct, we conducted a case study on the regional metabolism of bio-fuels from locally grown plant crops, a hotspot in regional environmental research. In the case study we screened key components for inconsistent variables, identified the relationships between components, and rated the sustainability of the regional bio-fuel metabolism system suggested by the model. This study demonstrated that our research approach can inform bio-fuel policy making. The QNM is helpful in the understanding of regional metabolism in the broader context of SENCE theory and may be used to improve regional environmental management and policy-making.}}

The first investigation reveals that the outage of the second (backup) 400 kV Bina–Gwalior–Agra line on 29 July 2012 led to the cascading failure through the grid, which can be simulated and explained from the perspective of the complex networks theory. In this paper, a new model of a power grid involving the active and reactive power loads is proposed and then used to analyze the cascading behavior of power grids, which is also used to explain the reason of the blackout happening in India. Furthermore, some strategic advices are given for improving the stability and security of power grids, especially Indian power grids.}}

Robustness, thus, is an essential characteristic that GRNs need to fulfill in order to maintain viability and reproducibility in a species. In the present work we analyze the robustness of the patterning for the ocellar complex formation in Drosophila melanogaster fly. We have systematically pruned the GRN that drives the development of this visual system to obtain the minimum pathway able to satisfy this pattern. We found that the mechanism underlying the patterning obeys to the dynamics of a 3-nodes network motif with a double negative feedback loop fed by a morphogenetic gradient that triggers the inhibition in a French flag problem fashion. A Boolean modeling of the GRN confirms robustness in the patterning mechanism showing the same result for different network complexity levels. Interestingly, the network provides a steady state solution in the interocellar part of the patterning and an oscillatory regime in the ocelli. This theoretical result predicts that the ocellar pattern may underlie oscillatory dynamics in its genetic regulation.}}

In this paper, we prove that the minimum driver vertices driven by different inputs are not sufficient to ensure the full control of the network when the associated graph contains the inaccessible strongly connected component which has perfect matching and propose an algorithm to identify a minimum controlled vertex set for network with arbitrary structure using convenient graph and mathematical tools. And the simulation results show that the controllability of network is correlated to the number of inaccessible strongly connected components which have perfect matching and these results promote us to better understand the relationship between the network's structural characteristics and its control.}}

abstract = {Abstract The appearance of macro-engineering and mega-project have led to the increasing complexity of modern electromechanical systems (EMSs). The complexity of the system structure and failure mechanism makes it more difficult for reliability assessment of these systems. Uncertainty, dynamic and nonlinearity characteristics always exist in engineering systems due to the complexity introduced by the changing environments, lack of data and random interference. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the reliability assessment of complex systems. In view of the dynamic characteristics within the system, it makes use of the advantages of the dynamic fault tree (DFT) for characterizing system behaviors. The lifetime of system units can be expressed as bounded closed intervals by incorporating field failures, test data and design expertize. Then the coefficient of variation (COV) method is employed to estimate the parameters of life distributions. An extended probability-box (P-Box) is proposed to convey the present of epistemic uncertainty induced by the incomplete information about the data. By mapping the DFT into an equivalent Bayesian network (BN), relevant reliability parameters and indexes have been calculated. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method is utilized to compute the DFT model with consideration of system replacement policy. The results show that this integrated approach is more flexible and effective for assessing the reliability of complex dynamic systems.}}

It has been shown in Wang and Elia (2012) that such networked system generates a collective Lévy flight behavior when part of the system loses mean square (MS) stability. We focus on spatially invariant architectures to gain more insights into how model parameters affect emergence of this complex scale-invariant behavior, and to seek structures robust to communication constraints. Specifically, we develop a computational expression for checking MS stability, which is scalable with the number of unreliable links. We derive the closed form formulas from this expression in the limiting case of zero and large delays, and in the case of large number of nodes. In the limit of large delays, we derive various results that are independent of the network size and its specific interconnections. We find that small inter-agent coupling improves the robustness of the system. Networks with larger connectivity tend to be more fragile in the presence of fading connections for fixed inter-agent coupling. That gossiping improves the robustness and that the lattice is the most robust among the spatially invariant systems with generalized circulant interconnections.}}

In this study, we propose an approach to the quantification of this communication, with the aid of the Information Theory, and model seismicity as a Complex Network.

The other model on the complex emotion classification also achieves promising results. We thoroughly analyze the impact of vocabulary quality and topic quantity to emotion and intensity prediction in our experiments. The distribution of topics such as Friend and Job are found to be sensitive to the documents' emotions, which we call emotion topic variation in this paper.

These results have been obtained both considering exchanges between nearest neighbors or in a mean field scheme. In the present paper we study the effect of distributing the agents on a complex network. We have considered archetypical complex networks: Erdös–Rényi random networks and scale-free networks. The presence of a poverty line with finite wealth is preserved but spatial correlations are important, particularly between the degree of the node and the wealth.

The most successful approach to describe how coherent behavior emerges in these complex systems is given by the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. This model has been traditionally studied in complete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, complex systems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as complex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the field of synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we provide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global dynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which encompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis of several numerical results. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments on variations of the Kuramoto model in networks, including the presence of noise and inertia. The rich potential for applications is discussed for special fields in engineering, neuroscience, physics and Earth science. Finally, we conclude by discussing problems that remain open after the last decade of intensive research on the Kuramoto model and point out some promising directions for future research.}}

This method is assessed on the pre-AF epicardial signals of canine which includes the normal group A (no further AF will happen), the mild group B (the following AF time is less than 180 s) and the severe group C (the following AF time is more than 180 s). 25 optimal features are selected out of 180 features from each sample. With these features, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 99.40%, 99.70% and 99.60%, respectively, which are the best among the recurrence based methods. The results suggest that the proposed method can predict AF accurately and thus can be prospectively used in the postoperative evaluation.}}

The complex network as well as discrete element methods (DEM) is adopted, in which the contact network and the force network are mainly considered. Comparing the contact network to the microstructure evolution, we find that pores always form in a large contact polygon. In the force network, the normal contact forces distribute extremely non-uniform. An interesting phenomenon is that a ring-like structure of force chain emerges spontaneously in the sintering force networks, whose life expectance is much longer than other linear force chains. Furthermore, a high contact force is more likely to form at a new contact site. To our knowledge, it is the first time to study force distributions and microstructure evolutions in sintering from the complex network point of view, which should be a promising method for further investigating the complex sintering process in the future.}}

We explore the hypothesis that increasing complexity in mega-regions implies less demands on resources needed to generate organized information, thereby making the systems more efficient and stable. This article aims to identify structural indicators for measuring urban networks at the mega-regional scale. We use night-time light data from the broad band near-visible infrared channel of the DMSP-OLS to monitor the dynamics of urbanization. We study the urban networks as graphs, where nodes are cities, and the main road and railway infrastructures represent the edges. We propose four indicators for measuring the complexity, polycentricity, efficiency and stability of networks of cities. These indicators are derived from studies and approaches such as the use of graphs and small-world networks that other authors have carried out to explain similar structures. In the article we apply the structural indicators to 12 European mega-regions. The main conclusion is that mega-regional urban systems respond to increasing complexity by adapting their relational structures to become more efficient and stable, and become more sustainable forms of organization. Consequently, it could be necessary to re-direct land use policies towards improving sustainability at the level of the mega-region.}}

The uneven distribution of the production and consumption of fossil fuel makes the fossil fuel flows between countries by international trade. This study aims to quantitatively analyse the features and evolution of the international trade of fossil fuel by complex network and emergy. We transform the trade quantity of coal, crude oil and natural gas into emergy by transformity and the sum of the three emergies is the emergy of fossil fuel. The complex network models of the integrated fossil fuel trade as well as the trade of coal, crude oil and natural gas are built up based on the value of emergy. We analyse the trade relationships, trade quantity, trade density, and hierarchy structure of the networks. We find that the number of trade relationships and the trade quantities follow the power law distribution; countries with many export relationships tend to have many import relationships; the centralization of trade quantity is becoming more intense for fossil fuel, crude oil and coal, but less intense for natural gas; the pattern of top relationships is diversified; the trade density of fossil fuel is increasing; and countries with more than 20 trade relationships tend to have a hierarchy structure. Our findings implicate that as the hierarchy structure is becoming more ordered, the statuses of the countries are clearer, and thus it is easier for policy makers to identify the roles of their own countries or the roles of other countries. Coal is the "cheapest" fuel measuring by "energy cost" and is the most widely traded type of fossil fuel. When two countries exchange fossil fuel and money in the international trade, they should look further into the energy cost of them and reconsider the effectiveness of the trade. Our study can also reveal the trade strategy of the countries.}}

A time-varying and switching network topology, constructed by the adaptive graph Laplacian matrix, relaxes the standard requirement of consensus stability, even permitting exponential synchronization on an unbalanced digraph or a weakly connected digraph that can sporadically lose connectivity. The time-varying graph Laplacian matrix is adapted by an adaptive control scheme based on relative positions and errors of synchronization and tracking. The adaptive graph Laplacian is integrated with a phase synchronization controller that synchronizes the relative motions of EL systems moving in elliptical orbits, thereby yielding a smaller synchronization error than an uncoupled tracking control law in the presence of bounded disturbances and modeling errors. An example of reconfiguring hundreds of spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit shows the effectiveness of the proposed phase synchronization controller for a large number of complex EL systems moving in periodic elliptical orbits.}}

This paper reveals a new measure for assessing the influence effect based on influence scope maximization, which can complement the traditional measure of the expected number of influenced nodes. A novel method for identifying influential nodes in complex networks with community structure is proposed. This method uses the information transfer probability between any pair of nodes and the k-medoid clustering algorithm. The experimental results show that the influential nodes identified by the k-medoid method can influence a larger scope in networks with obvious community structure than the greedy algorithm without reducing the expected number of influenced nodes.}}

The topology of this system is described by task-resource network and modeled as directed and weighted graph, in which nodes represent various tasks and edges denote the resources exchanged among tasks. Using the properties of node degree distribution, strength distribution and other weighted quantities, we demonstrate the heterogeneity of the network and point out the relation between structural characters of vertices and the functionality of corresponding tasks. The above phenomena indicate that the design requirements and principles of production process contribute to the heterogeneous features of the network. Besides, betweenness centrality of nodes can be used as an importance indicator to provide additional information for decision making. The correlations between structure and weighted properties are investigated to further address the influence brought by production schemes in system connectivity patterns. Cascading failures model is employed to analyze the robustness of the network when targeted attack happens. Two capacity assignment strategies are compared in order to improve the robustness of the network at certain cost. The refinery system displays more reliable behavior when the protecting strategy considers heterogeneous properties. This phenomenon further implies the structure-activity relationship of the refinery system and provides insightful suggestions for process system design. The results also indicate that robustness analysis is a promising application of methodologies from complex networks to process system engineering.}}

As artificial network structures, we consider scale-free networks constructed through preferential attachment and Watts–Strogatz networks. Numerical simulations show that scale-free networks with degree-based social power on the hub nodes have an optimal case where the largest number of the nodes reaches a consensus. However, given power to a random selection of nodes could not improve consensus properties. Introducing social power in Watts–Strogatz networks could not significantly change the consensus profile.}}

We find that the growth of the clustering coefficient and that of the number of edges are approximately scaled with the development of shear strength and hydraulic conductivity, which could possibly be utilized to estimate and formulate a friction law and the evolution of shear distribution over asperities. Moreover, the frictional interface is mapped in the global–local parameter space of the corresponding functional friction network, showing the evolution path and, eventually, the residual stage. Furthermore, we show that with respect to shear direction, parallel aperture patches are more adaptable to environmental stimuli than perpendicular profiles. We characterize the pure-contact profiles using the same approach. Unlike the first case, the later networks show a growing trend while in the residual stage; a saturation of links is encoded in contact networks.}}

abstract = {Abstract Modeling natural Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN) receives more and more attention in applied geosciences, from oil and gas industry, to geothermal recovery and aquifer management. The fractures may be either natural, or artificial in case of well stimulation. Accounting for the flow inside the fracture network, and accounting for the transfers between the matrix and the fractures, with the same level of accuracy is an important issue for calibrating the well architecture and for setting up optimal resources recovery strategies. Recently, we proposed an original method allowing to model transient pressure diffusion in the fracture network only [1]. The matrix was assumed to be impervious. A systematic approximation scheme was built, allowing to model the initial DFN by a set of N unknowns located at each identified intersection between fractures. The higher N, the higher the accuracy of the model. The main assumption was using a quasi steady state hypothesis, that states that the characteristic diffusion time over one single fracture is negligible compared with the characteristic time of the macroscopic problem, e.g. change of boundary conditions. In that context, the lowest order approximation N = 1 has the form of solving a transient problem in a resistor/capacitor network, a so-called pipe network. Its topology is the same as the network of geometrical intersections between fractures. In this paper, we generalize this approach in order to account for fluxes from matrix to fractures. The quasi steady state hypothesis at the fracture level is still kept. Then, we show that in the case of well separated time scales between matrix and fractures, the preceding model needs only to be slightly modified in order to incorporate these fluxes. The additional knowledge of the so-called matrix to fracture transfer function allows to modify the mass matrix that becomes a time convolution operator. This is reminiscent of existing space averaged transient dual porosity models.}}

To this aim, we first derive a model for the finite-precision ACLMS updating equations. Then, using the established energy conservation argument, we derive a closed-form expression, in terms of the excess mean-square error (EMSE) metric which explains how the quantized ACLMS (QACLMS) algorithm performs in the steady-state. We further derive the required conditions for mean stability of the QACLMS algorithm. The derived expression, supported by simulations, reveals that unlike the infinite-precision case, the EMSE curve for QACLMS is not monotonically increasing function of the step-size parameter. We use this observation to optimize the step-size learning parameter. Simulation results illustrate the theoretical findings.}}

Here, we report the crystal structure of Spt16N from a plant origin (Spt16Nca, Cicer arietinum) and its comparisons with the known Spt16N structures from yeasts and human. The inter-domain angle in Spt16Nca is significantly different from that of the yeast and human Spt16N structures. Normal mode analysis and classical molecular dynamics simulations reveal inter-domain movement in Spt16Nca and later also shows conformational flexibility of the critical loops. Spt16Nca binds to histone H3/H4 complex, similar to its orthologs from yeast and human origins. Further, conservation of electrostatic surface potentials in Spt16N structures from evolutionary distinct domains of eukaryotes (plant, human and fungi) have provided the potential sites on Spt16N for histone interactions. The structural comparisons with M24 peptidases show that the hydrophobic pocket shielded by a flexible loop of C-terminal domain of Spt16N that may be functionally important.}}

This paper studies the public transport networks of 330 cities in China based on the space P concept. Statistical results show that the degree distribution of all networks can be described by an exponential function. It reveals that the evolution mechanism of public transport network is randomly connected instead of preferential attached. All the networks show typical small-world behaviors which characterized by larger clustering coefficient and smaller average shortest path. A transition between the dissortative small networks N&lt;1,000 and assortative large networks N7gt;1,000 is observed. Average clustering coefficient of nodes with degree k decreases with k as a power law, shows that city bus transfer networks are well characterized by hierarchical modularity.

One of the explanations is that interaction with other people trains the brain, thereby enhancing cognitive functioning. However, research on the relationship between personal networks and cognitive functioning is not yet conclusive. While previous studies have focused on the size of personal networks as a proxy of cognitive stimulation, little attention has been paid to the complexity of the personal network. Adults embedded in a broad range of network relationships (i.e., various relationship types) are likely to be exposed to a wider range of stimuli than adults embedded in a homogeneous network including similar relationship types. We expect that higher numbers of personal relationship types rather than a higher number of similar contacts relate to higher levels of cognitive functioning and slower cognitive decline. Data are from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) and include 2959 Dutch participants aged 54 to 85 at baseline in 1992 and six follow-ups covering a time span of twenty years. Cognitive functioning is assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and for network complexity we use the Social Network Index. We test our expectations using fixed-effects regression models. The results reveal that a reduction in network complexity is associated with a reduction in cognitive functioning, which is neither explained by size of the network nor by presence of specific relationship types. However, enhanced complexity has only a marginal buffering effect on decline in cognitive functioning. We conclude that network characteristics and cognitive functioning are intertwined and that their association is mostly cross-sectional in nature.}}

Current monitoring systems are well capable to monitor such large scale installations for simple situations like failing routers, links or abnormal link utilization. However, current systems fail to provide near real-time in-depth root cause analysis for nation scale networks. This is particularly important in cases where the monitoring dashboard is flooded with notifications caused by side-effects of one bigger failure. In our project we develop a processing system capable of providing this root cause analysis in a timely fashion even for large telecommunications networks. To cope with these challenges we defined a specialized processing model for the detection and analysis of complex error situations which is largely based on event stream processing mechanisms. In this paper we discuss the first stage of this process and its initial implementation.}}

Various sampling techniques like a Page Rank random walk, a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain and others serve to collect information about the nodes. The paper contributes to the comparison of sampling techniques in complex networks by means of the first hitting time, that is the minimal time required to reach a large node. Both the mean and the distribution of the first hitting time is shown to be determined by the so called extremal index. The latter indicates a dependence measure of extremes and also rejects the cluster structure of the network. The clustering is caused by dependence between nodes and heavy-tailed distributions of their degrees. Based on extreme value theory we estimate the mean and the distribution of the first hitting time and the distribution of node degrees by real data from social networks. We demonstrate the heaviness of the tails of these data using appropriate tools. The same methodology can be applied to other complex networks like peer- to-peer telecommunication systems.}}

The evaluation results of polar CVNN model prove to be more adequate to accurately describe the nonlinear dynamic magnitude and phase distortions of RSOA, compared to double-input double-output real-valued neural network (RVNN) rectangular structure. Additionally, significant reduction of the computational cost is achieved in comparison to the RVNN approach.}}

And we numerically find the optimal value of the parameter, at which two types of networks can reach the strongest robust level against cascading failures.

Our results may be very useful for constructing the optimal protection strategy in realistic networks and for leading to insights into the mitigation of cascading failures.}}

A new method based on the local degree central node to detect the local community is proposed. In our method, the local community is not discovered from the given starting node, but from the local degree central node that is associated with the given starting node. Experiments show that the local central nodes are key nodes of communities in complex networks and the local communities detected by our method have high accuracy. Our algorithm can discover local communities accurately for more nodes and is an effective method to explore community structures of large networks.}}

In this paper, we discuss an elastic model to enhance the control of undirected networks and study the controllability of random networks with built-in gradually varied modularity as well as real-world networks to elaborate the correlation between the networks' controllability and modularity. The results show that it is easier to control the networks with stronger modularity than that of weaker modularity, and the networks with larger size communities probably need more driver nodes to control than that of smaller size communities when we fix both the number of nodes and the number of links of the networks. In addition, the robustness analysis indicates that the model enhances the resistance of networks against link failure. This work shows that the controllability of complex networks is highly associated with the networks' degree distribution as well as the networks' modularity, which gives a new insight into the understanding of controllability and modularity of complex networks.}}

The theoretical results in this paper have generalized the synchronization-based identification method that has been reported in several literatures on identifying integer order complex networks. We further derive the sufficient condition that ensures successful network identification. An uncertain complex network with four fractional-order Lorenz systems is employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The numerical results show that this approach is applicable for online monitoring of the static or changing network topology. In addition, we present a discussion to explore which factor would influence the identification process. Certain interesting conclusions from the discussion are obtained, which reveal that large coupling strengths and small fractional orders are both harmful for a successful identification.}}

In this network model, color edges imply that both the outer coupling topology and the inner interactions between any pair of nodes may be different, and color nodes mean that local dynamics may be different. Based on the stability theory of fractional-order systems, the scheme of synchronization for fractional-order colored complex dynamical networks is presented. To achieve the synchronization of a complex fractional-order edge-colored network, the open-plus-closed-loop (OPCL) strategy is adopted and effective controllers for synchronization are designed. The open-plus-closed-loop (OPCL) strategy avoids the need for computation of eigenvalues of a very large matrix. Then, a synchronization method for a class of fractional-order colored complex network, containing both colored edges and colored nodes, is developed and some effective synchronization conditions via close-loop control are presented. Two examples of numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.}}

The improvements are three-fold: (1) in the optimization problem formulation, we introduce a third objective function to minimize the impacts of the switching off operations onto the existing network topology; (2) in the optimization problem formulation, we use the final results of cascades, rather than only a short horizon of one step cascading, to evaluate the effects of the switching off strategies; (3) in the optimization algorithm, the fast non-dominated sorting mechanisms are incorporated into the MBDE algorithm: a new algorithm, namely non-dominated sorting binary differential evolution algorithm (NSBDE) is then proposed.

Fiber optic communication networks have primarily been used for DASs in Korea because of their huge bandwidth and dielectric noise immunity. However, the fiber optic communication network has some shortcomings, particularly that its installation cost and communication fees are expensive. This paper proposes a complex communication network, where WLANs are linked into a fiber optic network to expand DASs in distribution lines inexpensively. A DAS wireless bridge (DWB) is designed for the proposed communication network using IEEE 802.11a WLAN technology. Feasibility of the proposed network is checked experimentally.}}

However there is increasing importance of social, economic and technical networks whose structures are not under the direct control of the designers, but evolve as a result of decisions and behaviors of individual self- directed entities. These networks are endogenous in nature, where the local characteristics and behaviors of nodes affect the overall structures. The structure of a network affects its properties, and the properties affect the system's performance. Hence, the problem of designing such endogenously evolving networks involves determining the node-level characteristics and behaviors through appropriate incentives to achieve the desired system-level performance. In this paper, our goal is to illustrate the problem of designing endogenously evolving networks, and to present a specific illustrative example. We perform a conceptual exploration of the problem, present the current state of the art and identify research gaps. The illustrative example involves designing an endogenous network with two objectives, robustness to random node failure and resilience to targeted attack, considering specific node-level characteristics, additional attractiveness, as the design variables. The impact of the design variables on the performance of the network, and potential applications are discussed.}}

abstract = {Abstract In some cities, concerns over the sustainability of the water distribution system have led to different strategies to cope with the demand in terms of quantity and quality. The Barcelona Metropolitan Area drinking water distribution system is supplied with water from different sources (two rivers, the Mediterranean Sea and groundwater) and is treated with different technologies (classical chlorination, membrane filtering, etc.). Different blending processes occur along the network to homogenize the water quality, both chemically and organoleptically. An appropriate technology that can recognize the water source and blends in real time along the network is crucial for global system management. This study presents a principal component analysis method capable of discriminating samples with respect to their original source and blends using Ultraviolet–Visible data from a spectrophotometric probe and a small number of physicochemical parameters. The study began with principal component analysis of 37 physicochemical parameters obtained through standard laboratory procedures to distinguish among sources and blends. Further, the study investigated the possibility of discriminating the same sources and blends using only fingerprints obtained by a spectrophotometric probe. A high correlation coefficient of 0.85 revealed that the information contained in the spectra is comparable to the information provided by more expensive laboratory analyses. Moreover, the discrimination capacity of this method on Ultraviolet–Visible data was slightly improved by adding three additional physicochemical parameters: conductivity, fluoride and boron concentrations. Generally, the new model could distinguish the two primary water origins of the Barcelona Metropolitan Area – the Llobregat and the Ter Rivers. The contribution of desalinated seawater and groundwater was also distinguishable in the blends containing river water. Moreover, during the method development, the influence of the water sources and blending on the occurrence and speciation of different trihalomethanes along the city was evaluated. Water from the Llobregat River tends to form brominated trihalomethanes, while water from the Ter River tends to form chlorinated trihalomethanes. The results of this study confirm that the chemometric analysis of a number of selected parameters can provide a sufficient amount of information to operate complex distribution systems using water blending. This method will contribute to the early identification of events, as well as to the operation and management of the network and evaluation of the sustainability of the system by providing information on water quality.}}

Study Design A self-administered survey was conducted from January through May 2011 among obstetricians from 21 hospitals that included 30 questions regarding their knowledge, attitudes, and practice of the 3 evidence-based interventions and the 14-item short version of the Team Climate for Innovation survey. Frequency of use of each intervention was ascertained from an obstetrical cohort of women between January 2010 and February 2011. Results A total of 329 obstetricians (74% response rate) who managed 16,946 deliveries within the obstetrical cohort participated in the survey. More than 90% of obstetricians reported that they incorporated each intervention into routine practice. Actual frequency of administration in women eligible for the treatments was 93% for corticosteroids, 39% for progesterone, and 71% for magnesium sulfate. Provider satisfaction with quality of treatment evidence was 97% for corticosteroids, 82% for progesterone, and 57% for magnesium sulfate. Obstetricians perceived that barriers to treatment were most frequent for progesterone (76%), 30% for magnesium sulfate, and 17% for corticosteroids. Progesterone use was more frequent among patients whose provider reported the quality of the evidence was above average to excellent compared with poor to average (42% vs 25%, respectively; P &lt; .001), and they were satisfied with their knowledge of the intervention (41% vs 28%; P = .02), and was less common among patients whose provider reported barriers to hospital or pharmacy drug delivery (31% vs 42%; P = .01). Corticosteroid administration was more common among patients who delivered at hospitals with 24 hours a day–7 days a week maternal-fetal medicine specialist coverage (93% vs 84%; P = .046), Conclusion Obstetricians in Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network hospitals frequently use these evidence-based interventions; however, progesterone use was found to be related to their assessment of evidence quality. Neither progesterone nor the other interventions were associated with overall climate of innovation within a hospital as measured by the Team Climate for Innovation. National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference Statements may also have an impact on use; there is such a statement for antenatal corticosteroids but not for progesterone for preterm prevention or magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection.}}

Qualification includes environmental testing such as temperature, vibration, and shock to support a stochastic argument about the suitability of a design. Qualification is becoming more complex and restricted yet available new technologies are not fully utilized. Technology has advanced to the state where 6DOF vibration shakers and control systems capable of high frequency tests are possible, but the problem using these systems is far more complex than traditional single degree of freedom (SDOF) tests. This challenges systems engineers as they strive to plan qualification in an environment where technical, environmental, and political constraints are coupled with the traditional cost, risk and schedule constraints. New technologies are also available for systems engineers to combine technical understanding with cost, risk and schedule factors to aid in decision making for complex problems such as qualification planning. BN models may provide the framework to aid Systems Engineers in planning qualification efforts with complex constraints. This paper discusses related work, the current approach and results of this research.}}

Nodes were removed sequentially according to the importance criterion defined by the attack strategy, and we used the size of the largest connected component (LCC) as a measure of network damage. We found that the efficiency of attack strategies (fraction of nodes to be deleted for a given reduction of LCC size) depends on the topology of the network, although attacks based on either the number of connections of a node or betweenness centrality were often the most efficient strategies. Sequential deletion of nodes in decreasing order of betweenness centrality was the most efficient attack strategy when targeting real-world networks. The relative efficiency of attack strategies often changed during the sequential removal of nodes, especially for networks with power-law degree distribution.}}

It is of crucial importance in many fields, from economics to biology and from urban planning to social sciences, to identify the most (or the less) influent nodes in a network using centrality measures. However, defining the centrality of actors in interconnected complex networks is not trivial. In this paper, we rely on the tensorial formalism recently proposed to characterize and investigate this kind of complex topologies, and extend two well known random walk centrality measures, the random walk betweenness and closeness centrality, to interconnected multilayer networks. For each of the measures we provide analytical expressions that completely agree with numerically results.}}

It is discovered that the update gains, the time delay, the network size and the network topology have influence on the synchronization effect. Furthermore, projective lag synchronization of the dynamical networks can still be efficiently realized in presence of noise and parameter perturbations.

Preferential attachment in the BA model operates on the assumption that a node which has more links has a better likelihood to create new links. In this work, we expand the PA mechanism by treating it as a cyclic mechanism which is linked to both direct and indirect neighbours of a node. The assumption behind this extension is that the preference of nodes is influenced by their indirect neighbours as well. We show that traditional PA can be absorbed as a special case of this new growth model, which we name ‘cyclic preferential attachment' (CPA). We also discuss the properties of simulated networks that were generated based on CPA. Finally, we compare and contrast the CPA based networks with the traditional PA based networks and several real-world networks of similar sizes and link-to-node ratios, and show that CPA offers more flexibility in modeling real world networks.}}

To this end, we first adopt two widely used quantities as the measures for the dissimilarity between vertices. The dissimilarity is then transformed into its corresponding distance in a Euclidean space via the non-metric multidimensional scaling. We applied the proposed method to real-world as well as models of complex networks. We empirically found that real-world complex networks were embedded in a Euclidean space of relatively lower dimensions and the configuration of vertices in the space was mostly characterized by the self-similarity of a multifractal. In contrast, by applying the same scheme to the network models, we found that, in general, higher dimensions were needed to embed the networks into a Euclidean space and the embedding results usually did not exhibit the self-similar property. From the analysis, we learn that the proposed method serves a way not only to visualize the complex networks in a Euclidean space but to characterize the complex networks in a different manner from conventional ways.}}

The obtained results suggest that the exponential of the Minkowski distance is the most suitable metric to quantify the similarities between pairs of objects. In addition, the community identification method based on the greedy optimization provides the best cluster solution.

The inheritance of the visibility graph from the original time series was further explored in the paper. We found that degree distributions of visibility graphs extracted from Pseudo Brownian Motion series obtained by the Frequency Domain algorithm exhibit exponential behaviors, in which the exponential exponent is a binomial function of the Hurst index inherited in the time series. Our simulations presented that the quantitative relations between the Hurst indexes and the exponents of degree distribution function are different for different series and the visibility graph inherits some important features of the original time series. Further, we convert some quarterly macroeconomic series including the growth rates of value-added of three industry series and the growth rates of Gross Domestic Product series of China to graphs by the visibility algorithm and explore the topological properties of graphs associated from the four macroeconomic series, namely, the degree distribution and correlations, the clustering coefficient, the average path length, and community structure. Based on complex network analysis we find degree distributions of associated networks from the growth rates of value-added of three industry series are almost exponential and the degree distributions of associated networks from the growth rates of GDP series are scale free. We also discussed the assortativity and disassortativity of the four associated networks as they are related to the evolutionary process of the original macroeconomic series. All the constructed networks have "small-world" features. The community structures of associated networks suggest dynamic changes of the original macroeconomic series. We also detected the relationship among government policy changes, community structures of associated networks and macroeconomic dynamics. We find great influences of government policies in China on the changes of dynamics of GDP and the three industries adjustment. The work in our paper provides a new way to understand the dynamics of economic development.}}

Patients with an ISS ≥ 16 would be transferred to the regional Major Trauma Centre (level 1). Our premise was that trauma units (level 2) would no longer manage complex foot and ankle injuries thereby obviating the need for a foot and ankle specialist service. Methods Retrospective analysis of the epidemiology of foot and ankle injuries, using the Gloucestershire trauma database, from a trauma unit with a population of 750,000. Rates of open fractures, complex foot and ankle injuries and requirement for stabilisation with external fixation were reviewed before and after the introduction of the regional Trauma Network. Secondly, using the Trauma Audit &amp; Research Network (TARN) database, all foot and ankle injuries triaged to the regional Major Trauma Centre (MTC) were reviewed. Results Incidence of open foot and ankle injuries was 2.9 per 100,000 per year. There were 5.1% open injuries before the network and 3.2% after (p &gt; 0.05). Frequency of complex foot and ankle injuries was 4.2% before and 7.5% after the network commenced, showing no significant change. There was no statistically significant change in the numbers of patients with complex foot and ankle injuries treated by application of external fixators. Analysis of TARN data revealed that only 18% of patients with foot and ankle injuries taken to the MTC had an ISS ≥ 16. The majority of these patients were identified as requiring plastic surgical intervention for open fractures (69%) or were polytrauma patients (43%). Only 4.5% of patients had isolated, closed foot and ankle injuries. Conclusion We found that at the trauma unit there was no decrease in the numbers of complex foot and ankle injuries, open fractures, or the applications of external fixators, following the introduction of the Trauma Network. These patients will continue to attend trauma units as they usually have an ISS &lt; 16. Our findings suggest that there is still a need for foot and ankle specialists at trauma units, in order to manage patients with complex foot and ankle injuries.}}

Through a mean-field approximation and large-scale numerical simulations, we find that postponing the transition from the infectious to the recovered states can largely reduce the epidemic threshold, therefore promoting the outbreak of epidemics. On the other hand, if we consider nonuniform transmission among individuals, the epidemic threshold increases, thus inhibiting the spreading process. When both mechanisms are at work, the latter might prevail, hence resulting in an increase of the epidemic threshold with respect to the standard case, in which both ingredients are absent. Our findings are of interest for a better understanding of how diseases propagate on structured populations and to a further design of efficient immunization strategies.}}

We model a network generated by three mechanisms that are present in various networked systems; growth, global rewiring and local rewiring. During a rewiring phase a node is randomly selected, one of its out-going edges is detached from its destination then re-attached to the network in one of two possible ways; either globally to a randomly selected node, or locally to a descendant of a descendant of the originally selected node. Although the probability of attachment to a node increases with its connectivity, the probability of detachment also increases, the result is an exponential degree distribution with a small number of outlying nodes that have extremely large degree. We explain these outliers by identifying the circumstances for which a set of nodes can grow to very high degree.}}

The main aim of this research is to develop FSC estimation in complex alpine-forested environments using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology as a fusion framework between multi-sensor remotely sensed data at medium temporal/spatial resolution (e.g.16-day revisit time; 30 m; Landsat), and high spatial resolutions (e.g.1 m; IKONOS). This research is the first known attempt to develop a multi-scale estimator of FSC from surface equivalent reference data derived from IKONOS multispectral data. It is also the first endeavor to estimate FSC values by combining terrain and snow/non-snow reflectance data. The plasticity of the developed ANN Landsat-FSC model accommodates alpine-forest heterogeneity, and renders unbiased, comprehensive, and precise FSC estimates. The accuracy of the ANN Landsat based FSC is characterized by: (1) very low error values (mean error ~ 0.0002; RMSE ~ 0.10; MAE ~ 0.08 FSC), (2) high correlation with the ground equivalent reference datasets derived from 1 m resolution IKONOS images (r2 ~ 0.9), and (3) robust FSC estimation that is independent of terrain/vegetation alpine heterogeneity. The latter is supported by a spatially uniform distribution of errors, and lack of correlation between terrain (slope, aspect, terrain shadow distribution), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the error (r2 = 0).}}

New method We have inquired whether such patterns of action potentials (spikes) can be extracted from extracellular activity sampled simultaneously from many neurons across the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb (OB). Spikes were sampled from urethane-anaesthetized rats over a 6 h recording session, or a period lasting as long as permitted by the physiological condition of the animal. Breathing was recorded to mark peak inhalation and exhalation. Results Complex T-patterns of up to ∼20 elements were identified with functional connections often spanning the full extent of the array. A considerable proportion of these sequences incorporated breathing. Comparison with existing methods In contrast to sequence detection by synfire, the incidence of sequences detected in our real data is very much greater than in the same data when randomized either by shuffling, or an alternative procedure preserving the interval structure of each spike train, and so more conservative. Further, when recordings were terminated before completion of the full recording session, the relative pattern detection in real and randomized data was a strong indicator of physiological condition—in recordings leading up to the preparation becoming physiologically unstable, the number of patterns detected in real data approached that in the randomized data. Conclusions We conclude that such sequences are an important physiological property of the neural system studied, and suggest that they may form a basis for encoding sensory information.}}

Signal streams of ex vivo networks contain spikes and bursts of varying amplitude and duration. Despite the random interactions inherent in dissociated cultures, neurons are capable of establishing functional ex vivo networks that transmit signals among synaptically connected neurons, undergo developmental maturation, and respond to exogenous stimulation by alterations in signal patterns. These characteristics indicate that a considerable degree of organization is an inherent property of neurons. We demonstrate herein that (1) certain signal types occur more frequently than others, (2) the predominant signal types change during and following maturation, (3) signal predominance is dependent upon inhibitory activity, and (4) certain signals preferentially follow others in a non-reciprocal manner. These findings indicate that the elaboration of complex signal streams comprised of a non-random distribution of signal patterns is an emergent property of ex vivo neuronal networks.}}

abstract = {Network models that can capture the underlying network's topologies and functionalities are crucial for the development of complex network algorithms and protocols. In the engineering community, the performances of network algorithms and protocols are usually evaluated by running them on a network model. In most if not all reported work, the criteria used to determine such a network model rely on how close it matches the network data in terms of some basic topological characteristics. However, the intrinsic relations between a network topology and its functionalities are still unclear. A question arises naturally: For a network model which can reproduce some topological characteristics of the underlying network, is it reasonable and valid to use this model to be a test-bed for evaluating the network's performances? To answer this question, we take a close look at several typical complex network models of the AS-level Internet as examples of study. We find that although a model can represent the Internet in terms of topological metrics, it cannot be used to evaluate the Internet performances. Our findings reveal that the approaches using topological metrics to discriminate network models, which have been widely used in the engineering community, may lead to confusing or even incorrect conclusions.}}

Unfortunately, a lot of factors influence methane emission (chemical structure of metabolites, time, methane, gas pressure, microbiome composition, diet, etc.). We propose a new chemometric methodology to integrate different laboratory experiments in this field. Firstly, we report (1) new laboratory experiments to measure by separating (1a) methane production (gas phase), (1b) volatile fatty acid (VFA) distribution (liquid phase) and (1c) fatty acid (FA) distribution in rumen microbiome. Next, we also report a new (2) chemometric methodology that integrates all the data in a single theoretical model. The laboratory work includes two experimental sections (a) to measure the methane production, pH, gas pressure, temperature and (b) FA distribution. Section (b) includes two different experimental parts: chromatographic determination of internal peak areas (IPA%) of (b.1) long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and (b.2) VFA. In all studies, we can use different treatments, distribution phases (media, bacteria, or protozoan microbiome), cis/trans patterns, experimental protocols, etc. Next, we combined perturbation theory (PT), linear free-energy relationships (LFER), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to develop linear and non-linear models of perturbations in methane production–fatty acid distribution network. The best PT-LFER model found presented values of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy &gt; 0.94, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) &gt; 0.894 for 545,695 cases of perturbations in experimental data. This methodology may be useful to quantify the effect of perturbations due to the changes in experimental conditions in the study of fatty acid distribution when we need to carry out parallel experiments in different phases.}}

Managers and researchers are trying to dig out the major factors that lead to employees' promotion and resignation.

In this paper, we successfully collect a data set consisting of all the employees' work-related interactions (action network, AN for short) and online social connections (social network, SN for short) of a company, which inspires us to reveal the correlations between structural features and employees' career development, namely promotion and resignation. Through statistical analysis, we show that the structural features of both AN and SN are correlated and predictive to employees' promotion and resignation, and the AN has higher correlation and predictability. More specifically, the in-degree in AN is the most relevant indicator for promotion, while the k -shell index in AN and in-degree in SN are both very predictive to resignation. Our results provide a novel and actionable understanding of enterprise management and suggest that to enhance the interplays among employees, no matter work-related or social interplays, can be helpful to reduce staffs' turnover risk.}}

However, the fundamental question of how the synchronizability of the networks relates to accelerated growth and ad hoc property in the evolving processes remains underexplored. Here we study the ad hoc dynamical models with accelerated growth where the total number of edges increases faster than linearly with network size. By adopting three attachment mechanisms: random, rewired, and preferential attachment, we investigate the second-largest eigenvalues and the ratios of the extremal eigenvalues of coupled matrices in the accelerated models with different evolving parameters. For the new models, we demonstrate the robustness and fragility of synchronization against random and specific attacks by numerical simulations. We find that accelerated growth represents a convenient tool for improving the synchronizability of an evolving network. Furthermore, we show that not only network synchronization but also topological periodicity has robustness and fragility against random failures and specifical removal of the nodes, respectively. In particular, when ad hoc property is suggested in the evolving networks, we find that the deletion of nodes is easier to change network synchronizability and robustness compared to the addition of nodes.}}

In this work, we propose a dynamical definition of network robustness based on Information Theory, that considers measurements of the structural changes caused by failures of the network's components. Failures are defined here as a temporal process defined in a sequence. Robustness is then evaluated by measuring dissimilarities between topologies after each time step of the sequence, providing a dynamical information about the topological damage. We thoroughly analyze the efficiency of the method in capturing small perturbations by considering different probability distributions on networks. In particular, we find that distributions based on distances are more consistent in capturing network structural deviations, as better reflect the consequences of the failures. Theoretical examples and real networks are used to study the performance of this methodology.}}

Several particular results are searched: which ports are currently rising or dwindling in throughput; how is the structure of their network dynamics; and how to describe the resemblances and differences between these two transport patterns. In a densely connected logistic scheme, like the current maritime transport network, classic statistical techniques cannot show an accurate measure of the regional and global importance of a port or a route, within the deeply interrelated global market. The influence of a given harbor must be put in relation with the whole set of the network nodes. Standard statistic tools also cannot explain the chronological evolution of a complex system such this, needed of an importance metric and a proper visualization treatment. Graph theory provides powerful mathematical tools in order to achieve such requirements. Several calculations (degree and centrality) can be performed on each node, in order to describe clearly the structure and evolution of the complex system formed by ports of call and routes performed between them. Besides this, new software representation tools, like Gephi and Tulip, allow the immediate and deep comprehension of the relations between all the elements of the graph computed, and the temporal evolution of the whole network. In this paper we will apply these methodologies to the entire database of containership and general cargo vessel positions in three periods: March 2008–February 2009, March 2009–February 2010 and March 2010–February 2011. The relevance of the time intervals for this analysis, in terms of length and immediacy, will lead us to an accurate and dynamic diagnostic for the evolution during the crisis years in the transport patterns of the two traffics considered.}}

Based on Barbalat's lemma, some sufficient synchronization criteria are derived by applying the nonlinear feedback control. Although previous work studied function projective synchronization on complex dynamical networks, the dynamics of the nodes are coupled partially linear chaotic systems. In our work, the dynamics of the nodes of the complex networks are any chaotic systems without the limitation of the partial linearity. In addition, each network can be undirected or directed, connected or disconnected, and nodes in either network may have identical or different dynamics. The proposed strategy is applicable to almost all kinds of complex networks. Numerical simulations further verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed synchronization method. Numeric evidence shows that the synchronization rate is sensitively influenced by the feedback strength, the time delay, the network size and the network topological structure.}}

The ANN models trained and validated by representative data generally outperform those by using random data. Sobols' sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate contributions of different uncertainty sources to model performance. Results indicate that the major uncertainty source is from ANN model parameter initialization. Hence an ANN model training strategy is designed in order to reduce the main uncertainty source: models are trained for many runs with random model parameter initializations and the model with the best performance is adopted.}}

In this model, by minimizing the initial and operating costs of energy supply system, capacity of various components, and optimal operation strategy are determined using continuous variables, and binary decision variables describe the existence/absence of each considered component and its on/off operation status. A distributed energy supply system is made up of district heating and cooling networks, gas turbines as the prime mover for CHP systems, photovoltaic systems (PV) and conventional equipments also, such as boilers and absorption and compression chillers. In this configuration, the required heat is obtained from natural gas consumption by cogeneration system and auxiliary boilers. Four different scenarios were defined to assess the impact of the use of photovoltaic and CCHP systems in the energy supply system in the residential complex. The economic and environmental results obtained from the scenarios revealed saving in costs and reduction in CO2 emissions in the optimal cogeneration system compared with using boilers to produce heat and of buying electricity from the grid.}}

In this review, we provide an update on the recent advances in XB development to summarize the role of XB in the assembly of metal-containing supramolecular networks. We begin by introducing the reader to halogen-related interactions by highlighting a selection of typical organic supramolecular networks. Next, we present an overview of metal-containing supramolecular networks based on XB in metal halide/pseudohalide, metal 2,2′-dipyridylamino/s-triazine, metal quinolylsalicylaldimine, metal thiacalixarene, metal tetrathiafulvalenium (TTF), metal porphyrin, and metal iodo-benzenecarboxylic acid systems. The conclusions describe the potential applications of halogen-bonded supramolecular networks.

Each uninfected vertex with at least r ≥ 1 infected neighbors becomes infected, remaining so forever.

The study is based on the methodological triangulation of hybrid web indicators resulting from a social network analysis, a semantic network analysis, and a link impact analysis, all conducted using big data mined from social media during the 13-month period. To examine the emergence and evolution of communication patterns around NKS on Twitter, all tweets that contained the Korean word for NKS and were publicly accessible were collected, amounting to a data set of 79,028 unique vertices and 1,866,085 edges. Our findings include the following. First, network density increased gradually over the period, reflecting a continuous decrease in the number of users participating in discussions around NKS. Second, according to quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) correlations, the semantic network characteristics of those discussions also changed over time, partly due to some systematic interference from members and supporters of the conservative party. Third, in this context Twitter served as a space where individual listeners interacted directly with the podcast and fellow listeners—a space that podcasts themselves do not provide. Fourth, the NKS phenomenon was characterized by the wide range of offline activities in which listeners were encouraged to participate alongside the podcast, such as books authored by panelists, public talks, and fundraising events. Such activities were marked not only by their critical content but also by elements of playfulness.}}

Under suitable conditions, two coupled networks can reach the hybrid synchronization, i.e., the outer synchronization between the drive and response networks, and the inner synchronization in each network simultaneously. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization scheme.}}

Simulation results show that the estimation performance is largely dependent on the topological properties of the networks, such as the average path length, the clustering coefficient and the degree distribution, indicating that the network topology indeed plays an important role in distributed estimation.

There are different ways to define similarity for grouping similar texts into clusters, as the concept of similarity may depend on the purpose of the task. For instance, in topic extraction similar texts mean those within the same semantic field, whereas in author recognition stylistic features should be considered. In this study, we introduce ways to classify texts employing concepts of complex networks, which may be able to capture syntactic, semantic and even pragmatic features. The interplay between various metrics of the complex networks is analyzed with three applications, namely identification of machine translation (MT) systems, evaluation of quality of machine translated texts and authorship recognition. We shall show that topological features of the networks representing texts can enhance the ability to identify MT systems in particular cases. For evaluating the quality of MT texts, on the other hand, high correlation was obtained with methods capable of capturing the semantics. This was expected because the golden standards used are themselves based on word co-occurrence. Notwithstanding, the Katz similarity, which involves semantic and structure in the comparison of texts, achieved the highest correlation with the NIST measurement, indicating that in some cases the combination of both approaches can improve the ability to quantify quality in MT. In authorship recognition, again the topological features were relevant in some contexts, though for the books and authors analyzed good results were obtained with semantic features as well. Because hybrid approaches encompassing semantic and topological features have not been extensively used, we believe that the methodology proposed here may be useful to enhance text classification considerably, as it combines well-established strategies.}}

The result shows that there are no dominant venture capital firms in China which act as hubs in the VC network, and multi-company syndication is not popular in China, meaning that the relationships among venture capital companies are weak. The network is robust under either random or intentional attack, and possesses small world property. We also find from its community structure that, venture capital companies are more concentrated in developed districts but the links within the same district are scarce as compared to the links between different developed districts, indicating that venture capital companies are more willing to syndicate with companies in other developed districts. Furthermore, venture capital companies which invest in the same industry have closer relations within their communities than those which do not invest in the same industry.}}

A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the obtained result. Numerical simulations illustrate that cluster synchronization performance for fractional-order complex dynamical networks is influenced by inner-coupling matrix, control gain, coupling strength and topological structures of the networks.}}

In this paper, we present a fully complex-valued functional link network (CFLN) with multivariate polynomials as the nonlinear functions. Unlike multilayer neural networks, the CFLN is free from local minima problem, and it offers very fast learning of parameters because of its linear structure. Polynomial based CFLN does not require an activation function which is a major concern in the complex-valued neural networks. However, it is important to select a smaller subset of polynomial terms (monomials) for faster and better performance since the number of all possible monomials may be quite large. Here, we use the orthogonal least squares (OLS) method in a constructive fashion (starting from lower degree to higher) for the selection of a parsimonious subset of monomials. It is argued here that computing CFLN in purely complex domain is advantageous than in double-dimensional real domain, in terms of number of connection parameters, faster design, and possibly generalization performance. Simulation results on a function approximation, wind prediction with real-world data, and a nonlinear channel equalization problem exhibit that the OLS based CFLN yields very simple structure having favorable performance.}}

We present a novel methodology to assess how compliant networks are to being perfect core-periphery structures. The approach is flexible, allowing for the identification of multiple cores in networks. We verify that the interbank network presents a high disassortative mixing pattern, suggesting preferential attachment of highly connected financial institutions to others with few connections. We use the clustering coefficient to assess the substitutability of financial institutions. We find that large banking institutions are counterparties that are easily substitutable in normal times. We uncover that the rich-club effect is strongly present in the community comprising the large banking institutions, as they normally form near-clique structures. Since they play the role of liquidity providers in the interbank market, this interconnectedness effectively endows the network with robustness, as participants that are with liquidity issues can easily substitute counterparties that are liquidity suppliers. This substitutability will likely vanish during periods of stress, increasing systemic risk and the likelihood of cascade failures.}}

McFCRN has two components: a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive component. A Fully Complex-valued Relaxation Network (FCRN) with a fully complex-valued Gaussian like activation function ( s e c h ) in the hidden layer and an exponential activation function in the output layer forms the cognitive component. The meta-cognitive component contains a self-regulatory learning mechanism which controls the learning ability of FCRN by deciding what-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn from a sequence of training data. The input parameters of cognitive components are chosen randomly and the output parameters are estimated by minimizing a logarithmic error function. The problem of explicit minimization of magnitude and phase errors in the logarithmic error function is converted to system of linear equations and output parameters of FCRN are computed analytically. McFCRN starts with zero hidden neuron and builds the number of neurons required to approximate the target function. The meta-cognitive component selects the best learning strategy for FCRN to acquire the knowledge from training data and also adapts the learning strategies to implement best human learning components. Performance studies on a function approximation and real-valued classification problems show that proposed McFCRN performs better than the existing results reported in the literature.}}

Here we investigate the scaling of density in complex networks under two classical box-covering renormalizations–network coarse-graining–and also different community-based renormalizations. The analysis on over 50 real-world networks reveals a power-law scaling of network density and size under adequate renormalization technique, yet irrespective of network type and origin. The results thus advance a recent discovery of a universal scaling of density among different real-world networks [P.J. Laurienti, K.E. Joyce, Q.K. Telesford, J.H. Burdette, S. Hayasaka, Universal fractal scaling of self-organized networks, Physica A 390 (20) (2011) 3608–3613] and imply an existence of a scale-free density also within–among different self-similar scales of–complex real-world networks.

We start here by analyzing the cumulative statistical distributions of the distance-sum of nodes in random and real-world networks. From this analysis we conclude that statistical distributions do not reveal the distance-sum heterogeneity in networks. Thus, we motivate an index of distance-sum heterogeneity based on a hypothetical consensus model in which the nodes of the network try to reach an agreement on their distance-sum values. This index is expressed as a quadratic form of the combinatorial Laplacian matrix of the network. The distance-sum heterogeneity index φ(G) gives a natural interpretation of the Balaban index for any kind of graph/network. We conjecture here that among graphs with a given number of nodes φ(G) is maximized for a graph with a structure resembling the agave plant. We also found the graphs that maximize φ(G) for a given number of nodes and links. Using this index and a normalized version of it we studied random graphs as well as 57 real-world networks. Our findings indicate that the distance-sum heterogeneity index reveals important structural characteristics of networks which can be important for understanding the functional and dynamical processes in complex systems.}}

We aimed to explore the potential molecular mechanism of T2DM. Material and methods GSE38642 microarray data downloaded from gene expression omnibus was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Profiling of complex functionality (ProfCom) was used to analyze the complex function and mine T2DM signature genes. Finally, the differential expression network (DEN) was constructed. Results We identified 147 DEGs including 59 up- and 88 down-regulated genes. With increasing of degree, the specificity of functional description of DEGs was higher. GO term of "integral to membrane and immune response (not receptor activity) not regulation of immune response" in degree 4 was enriched by 6 DEGs, while the GO term of "immune response" in degree 1 was enriched by 12 DEGs. Two complex functions of integral to membrane an immune response and response to glucose stimulus were enriched by 11 T2DM signature genes including ARG2, GLP1R, PFKFB2, PTPRN, ACSL5, CCR7, IL2RA, IL7R, IL1R2, IL1RL1 and CHST4. Finally, DEN including 11 signature genes and 491 edges was obtained. Conclusion The identified DEGs especially 11 signature genes such as PTPRN, GLP1R, CCR7 and IL2RA may play important roles in the pathogenesis of T2DM.}}

Its main virulence factor is an extracellular polysaccharide capsule whose structure, assembly and dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we apply improved protocols for sample preparation and recently-developed scanning microscopy techniques to visualize the ultrastructure of the C. neoformans capsule at high-resolution (up to 1 nm) and improved structural preservation. Although most capsule structures in nature consist of linear polymers, we show here that the C. neoformans capsule is a ‘microgel-like' structure composed of branched polysaccharides. Moreover, we imaged the capsule-to-cell wall link, which is formed by thin fibers that branch out of thicker capsule filaments, and have one end firmly embedded in the cell wall structure. Together, our findings provide compelling ultrastructural evidence for a branched and complex capsule conformation, which may have important implications for the biological activity of the capsule as a virulence factor.}}

Understanding their design principles and mechanisms of processing information is essential to grasp the molecular basis of virtually all biological processes. This is particularly challenging for human pathologies like cancers, as essentially each tumor is a unique disease with vastly deranged signaling networks. However, even in normal cells we know almost nothing. A few ‘signalosomes', like the COP9 and the TCR signaling complexes have been described, but detailed structural information on their architectures is largely lacking. Similarly, many growth factor receptors, for example EGF receptor, insulin receptor and c-Met, signal via huge protein complexes built on large platform proteins (Gab, Irs/Dok, p130Cas[BCAR1], Frs families etc.), which are structurally not well understood. Subsequent higher order processing events remain even more enigmatic. We discuss here methods that can be employed to study signaling architectures, and the importance of too often neglected features like macromolecular crowding, intrinsic disorder in proteins and the sophisticated cellular infrastructures, which need to be carefully considered in order to develop a more mature understanding of cellular signal processing.}}

The relevant subgraphs in these networks, called network motifs, are demonstrated to show core aspects of network functionality and can be used to analyze complex networks based on their topological fingerprint. We propose a novel approach of classifying social networks based on their topological aspects using motifs. As such, we define the classifiers for regular, random, small-world and scale-free topologies, and then apply this classification on empirical networks. We then show how our study brings a new perspective on differentiating between online social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus based on the distribution of network motifs over the fundamental topology classes. Characteristic patterns of motifs are obtained for each of the analyzed online networks and are used to better explain the functional properties behind how people interact online and to define classifiers capable of mapping any online network to a set of topological-communicational properties.}}

We systematically carried out gas–liquid two-phase flow experiments for measuring the time series of flow signals, which is studied in terms of the mapping from time series to complex networks. In particular, we construct directed weighted complex networks (DWCN) from time series and then associate different aspects of chaotic dynamics with the topological indices of the DWCN and further demonstrate that the DWCN can be exploited to detect unstable periodic orbits of low periods. Examples using time series from classical chaotic systems are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We construct and analyze numbers of DWCNs for different gas–liquid flow patterns and find that our approach can quantitatively distinguish different experimental gas–liquid flow patterns. Furthermore, the DWCN analysis indicates that slug flow shows obvious chaotic behavior and its unstable periodic orbits reflect the intermittent quasi-periodic oscillation behavior between liquid slug and large gas slug. These interesting and significant findings suggest that the directed weighted complex network can potentially be a powerful tool for uncovering the underlying dynamics leading to the formation of the gas–liquid slug flow.}}

The importance of the transformer grounding in the resulting load overvoltages is discussed for two different lightning events. These events emphasize either the induced-voltage component or the surge transference through the distribution transformer as the main source of overvoltages on the connected loads. A brief discussion is also presented on the efficiency of low-voltage surge arresters in protecting loads connected to complex low-voltage networks. The obtained results indicate that the effectiveness of improving the transformer grounding and of installing surge arresters at specific points of the low-voltage network is limited in terms of load protection if a complex network topology is considered. In some cases, especially for a lightning strike close to the low-voltage line, improving the transformer grounding can even increase load overvoltages.}}

Much attention has been paid to accurately predicting the protein complexes from the increasing amount of protein–protein interaction (PPI) data. Almost all of the current algorithms that concern the detection of protein complexes focus on discovering dense subgraphs based on the observation that dense subgraphs in a biological network may correspond to protein complexes. However, such an assumption would throw away further topological information about complexes. In this paper introducing the core-attachment concept, a novel core-attachment algorithm is developed by detecting the cores and attachments, respectively. To detect the cores of protein complexes, a virtual network is constructed using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the network involved, where each maximal clique corresponds to a protein complex core. With this notion, the problem of detecting protein complex cores is transformed into the classic all-cliques problem. The attachments are then merged into their cores to yield biologically meaningful complexes. A comprehensive comparison between MCL, DPClus, Coach, DECAFF and our algorithm has been made by comparing the predicted protein complexes with the benchmarked complexes. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the MCL, DPClus and DECAFF and has comparative performance with the Coach algorithm in terms of the accuracy of prediction. Moreover, the detected complexes with core-attachment structures match well with the benchmark data, demonstrating that our algorithm can provide more insightful perspectives. Robustness analysis further shows that the algorithm is very robust.}}

The objective of this research is to design algorithms for effective and automated conflict and error prevention and detection. Most algorithms developed earlier, i.e., the traditional algorithm, are centralized sequential algorithms which do not use relationships between conflicts and errors for prevention and detection. A constraint-based model is designed based on the complex network theory to define conflicts and errors and provide prescriptive models for real-world systems. Two algorithms, a centralized algorithm taking advantage of network topology and a decentralized algorithm enabling parallelism with distributed agents, are designed to prevent and detect conflicts and errors. Both algorithms use relationships between constraints to improve efficiency. Analytical study and simulation experiments are conducted to validate the new algorithms and compare their performance to that of the traditional algorithm. Results show that for effective prevention and detection, the decentralized algorithm shall be used according to four performance measures: time, coverage ability, preventability, and damage. If information transmission between agents is disrupted, the centralized algorithm shall be used to achieve better performance than the traditional algorithm.

This article introduces a complex systems entropy network for data mining in tumor clinics. A mutual information algorithm based on the random permutation test was proposed for assessing the correlation of multi-variables, and a complex network was established. Based on the tumor clinical data (718 cases) collected, data mining was performed with the help of the statistical information of the complex network. The results showed that interaction effects among multi-variables were discovered by a complex systems entropy network. A total of 116 pairs of synergy variables and 14 core synergy cliques, 82 pairs of antagonistic variables and 7 core antagonistic cliques were found after 718 cases of data mining. The results, for the most part, correspond with the actual clinics. It was concluded that the complex systems entropy network is suitable for the analysis of interaction effects among multi-variables and also for data mining in complex Chinese medicine clinics.}}

abstract = {Abstract Modern financial systems are greatly entangled. They exhibit a complex interdependence, including a network of bilateral exposures in the interbank market. The most frequent interaction consists in operations where institutions with surplus liquidity lend to those with a liquidity shortage. These loans may be interpreted as links between the banks and the links display features in some way representative of scale-free networks. While the interbank market is responsible for efficient liquidity allocation, it also introduces the possibility for systemic risk via financial contagion. Insolvency of one bank can propagate through links leading to insolvency of other banks. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of financial contagion in interbank networks whose distribution of links approaches a power law, as well as we improve previous models by introducing a simple mechanism to describe banks' balance sheets, that are obtained from information on network connectivity. By varying the parameters for the creation of the network, several interbank networks are built, in which the concentration of debt and credit comes from the distribution of links. The results suggest that more connected networks that have a high concentration of credit are more resilient to contagion than other types of networks analyzed.}}

Out of available meteorological parameters from the network (wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity), key factors governing the pattern of the time series concentrations were identified through input sensitivity analysis performed on the trained neural network model. The transport pathways of particulate matter under these key meteorological parameters were further analysed through bivariate concentration polar plots and k-means clustering techniques. The analysis shows that the external sources such as marine aerosols and local sources such as traffic and biomass burning contribute equally to the particulate matter concentrations at the study site. These results are in agreement with the results of receptor modelling by the Auckland Council based on Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Our findings also show that contrasting concentration–wind speed relationships exist between marine aerosols and local traffic sources resulting in very noisy and seemingly large random PM10 concentrations. The inclusion of cluster rankings as an input parameter to the ANN model showed a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.005) improvement in the performance of the ANN time series model and also showed better performance in picking up high concentrations. For the presented case study, the correlation coefficient between observed and predicted concentrations improved from 0.77 to 0.79 for PM2.5 and from 0.63 to 0.69 for PM10 and reduced the root mean squared error (RMSE) from 5.00 to 4.74 for PM2.5 and from 6.77 to 6.34 for PM10. The techniques presented here enable the user to obtain an understanding of potential sources and their transport characteristics prior to the implementation of costly chemical analysis techniques or advanced air dispersion models.}}

The minimum dominating set (MDS) approach has rapidly emerged as a promising algorithmic method to analyze complex biological networks integrated with human disorders, which can be composed of a variety of omics data, from proteomics and transcriptomics to metabolomics. Here we review the main theoretical foundations of the methodology and the key algorithms, and examine the recent applications in which biological systems are analyzed by using the MDS approach.}}

By means of the presented controllers and corresponding update laws, the outer synchronization between two complex delayed networks with adaptive coupling can be achieved without calculating the eigenvalues of the coupling configuration matrix. Simultaneously, the outer coupling matrix of the network and the system parameters of node dynamics are also identified. Furthermore, the proposed method can be easily extended to obtain consensus in the multi-agent systems.

By using a statistical network approach, we aimed to identify complex network patterns of Aβ deposition and explore the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele on cortical Aβ burden across AD phenotypes. Methods Sixteen amnestic AD participants and 18 cases with logopenic-variant of primary progressive aphasia (lv-PPA) with a high cortical Aβ burden were selected. A comprehensive clinical assessment, Aβ imaging, and APOE genotyping were performed in all cases. Statistical network analysis was undertaken based on the estimation of sparse partial correlations of Aβ burden between cortical regions. Global and regional network statistical parameters as well as the effect of APOE ε4 genotype on cortical Aβ were explored. Results The two groups showed equivalent distribution of cortical amyloid burden and frequency of APOE ε4 genotype. Statistical network analysis, however, demonstrated divergent connectivity properties. The lv-PPA group demonstrated higher mean network degree and shorter characteristic path length than the amnestic AD group. Amnestic AD cases showed connectivity hubs confined to the mesial temporal and prefrontal lobes bilaterally, whereas lv-PPA cases showed hubs scattered across the whole cortical mantle. An interaction effect on total Aβ burden between APOE genotype and AD presentations was also detected. Conclusions The network analysis reveals interregional network differences not evident using a simple comparison of Aβ burden. This suggests that regional neurotoxic effects may explain the phenotypical differences in AD presentation and that these can be modulated by APOE genotype.}}

However, little is known about its influence on the underlying cortical network. An assessment of comparable cortical dynamics between seizures and etomidate would allow for a more detailed study of the network parameters underlying the ictal stage by using etomidate as a proxy. The objective of the present work is to show that temporal lobe seizures produce network changes comparable to the ones elicited by etomidate administration. Methods Scalp and foramen ovale electrodes (FOE) recordings from nine temporal lobe epilepsy patients were analyzed under the complex network perspective. The clustering coefficients, average path lengths, density of links, modularity and spectral entropy were calculated during the pre-ictal and ictal stages and post-etomidate administration. Etomidate administration produced no seizure in any of the analyzed cases. Results The density of lines (six of nine patients) and spectral entropy (eight of nine patients) displayed similar behavior to the preictal–ictal transition when etomidate effects altered the epileptic network (FOE + scalp). When considering only the mesial sub-network, changes induced by etomidate perfusion replicated the same type of imbalance observed during the ictal stage in the nine patient's sample and in eight out of nine regarding the preictal stage. Both statistical significance at a level of 1% and size effects, evaluated by using the standardized mean differences, show similar network changes during the preictal–ictal and preictal–etomidate transitions. Conclusions Etomidate perfusion in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy induces network changes comparable to the changes resulting from seizures. Significance The finding reported here could improve the study of network dynamics during the ictal phase, not only with electrophysiological methods, but also in other cases, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging.}}

Recrystallisation of 1 and 3 in methanol gives single crystals of the unaltered [Cu(H2L)]2 (1) and [Co(H2L)(HL′)]·4.25CH3OH (3b·4.25CH3OH), where HL′ is the partially hydrolysed Schiff base. This agrees with the instability of 3 in solution, suffering not only hydrolysis but air oxidation of cobalt(II) to cobalt(III). In addition, the crystal structure of 3b shows that (H2L)2− adopts an unfamiliar cis-β arrangement in this complex. Furthermore, crystallographic characterisation of 1 and 3b·4.25CH3OH also shows that they both act as metallotectons in the construction of 3D networks by hydrogen bonding, promoted via the ancillary carboxylic donors of the ligand. Variable-temperature magnetic characterisation of 1 demonstrates that it is a weakly antiferromagnetically coupled system.}}

Previous computational approaches usually identify protein complexes from protein interaction network based on dense sub-graphs and incomplete priori information. Additionally, the computational approaches have little concern about the biological properties of proteins and there is no a common evaluation metric to evaluate the performance. So, it is necessary to construct novel method for identifying protein complexes and elucidating the function of protein complexes. In this study, a novel approach is proposed to identify protein complexes using random forest and topological structure. Each protein complex is represented by a graph of interactions, where descriptor of the protein primary structure is used to characterize biological properties of protein and vertex is weighted by the descriptor. The topological structure features are developed and used to characterize protein complexes. Random forest algorithm is utilized to build prediction model and identify protein complexes from local sub-graphs instead of dense sub-graphs. As a demonstration, the proposed approach is applied to protein interaction data in human, and the satisfied results are obtained with accuracy of 80.24%, sensitivity of 81.94%, specificity of 80.07%, and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.4087 in 10-fold cross-validation test. Some new protein complexes are identified, and analysis based on Gene Ontology shows that the complexes are likely to be true complexes and play important roles in the pathogenesis of some diseases.

In this paper, we employ for the first time the metrics betweenness, vulnerability and diversity to analyze written texts in Brazilian Portuguese. Using strategies based on diversity metrics, a better performance in automatic summarization is achieved in comparison to previous work employing complex networks. With an optimized method the Rouge score (an automatic evaluation method used in summarization) was 0.5089, which is the best value ever achieved for an extractive summarizer with statistical methods based on complex networks for Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore, the diversity metric can detect keywords with high precision, which is why we believe it is suitable to produce good summaries. It is also shown that incorporating linguistic knowledge through a syntactic parser does enhance the performance of the automatic summarizers, as expected, but the increase in the Rouge score is only minor. These results reinforce the suitability of complex network methods for improving automatic summarizers in particular, and treating text in general.}}

abstract = {Abstract Many networks of interest in sciences and social research can be divided naturally into anti-communities. The problem of detecting and characterizing such anti-community structure has attracted recent attention. In this paper, we first define the anti-modularity as a quantitative measure of anti-community partitioning on a network. We also theoretically and empirically show the reliability of anti-modularity as a measurement of the quality of an anti-community partitioning. A label propagation algorithm LPAD for anti-community detection is proposed. Experimental results on synthetic and real world networks show that our algorithm LPAD can obtain higher quality anti-community partitioning than other methods.}}

abstract = {Abstract A self-synchronizing network may undergo change of scale and topology during its functioning, thus adjustment of parameters is necessary to enable the synchronization. The adjustment cost and runtime-break demand a method to maintain continuous operation of the network. To address these issues, this paper presents an analytical method for the design of the inner coupling matrix. The proposed method renders the synchronization robust to change of network scale and topology. It is usual in network models that scale and topology are represented by outer coupling matrix. In this paper we only consider diffusively coupled networks. For these networks, the eigenvalues of the outer coupling matrix are all non-positive. By utilizing this property, the designed inner coupling matrix can cover the entire left half of complex plane within the synchronized region to underlie robustness of synchronization. After elaborating the applicability of several types of synchronization state for a robustly self-synchronizing network, the analytical design method is given for the stable equilibrium point case. Sometimes the Jacobian matrix of the node dynamical equation may lead to an unrealizable complex inner coupling matrix in the method. We then introduce a lemma of matrix transformation to prevent this possibility. Additionally, we investigated the choice of inner coupling matrix to get a desirable self-synchronization speed. The corresponding condition in the design procedure is given to drive the network synchronization faster than convergence of each node. Finally, the article includes examples that show effectiveness and soundness of the method.}}

Firstly, we present a method to transform a set of time series into a network using different distance functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and, consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series distance functions, network generation methods and community detection techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such as k-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.}}

Study design Using secondary analysis of data from an ongoing multiprovincial prospective cohort study, we studied 264 neonates undergoing complex cardiac repair. CS-AKI was defined based on the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) definition. We used regression modeling and survival analysis (adjusting for covariates) to evaluate associations. Results CS-AKI occurred in 64% of the neonates in our study cohort. Lower age, longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, hypothermic circulatory arrest, type of repair, lower preoperative serum creatinine (SCr) level, lower gestational age, and preoperative ventilation were independent risk factors for developing CS-AKI. Neonates with CS-AKI had longer times to extubation, intensive care discharge, and hospital discharge, after adjusting for covariates. Mortality was significantly increased in neonates with AKIN stage 2 or higher CS-AKI. The neonates with CS-AKI had a lower z-score for height at 2-year follow-up and were seen by more specialists. Conclusion Neonatal CS-AKI is common and independently predicts important clinical outcomes, including mortality. Many risk factors are similar to those in older children, but some are unique to neonates. The observation that lower baseline SCr predicts CS-AKI merits further study. The AKIN definition, based on preoperative SCr value, is a reasonable method for defining CS-AKI in neonates. Many previous studies of CS-AKI have excluded neonates; we suggest that future intervention studies on approaches to reducing CS-AKI incidence and improving outcomes should include neonates.}}

The density, connectedness and degree distribution are used to describe the overall performance of the network. The results show that the network has a low density and a high connectedness, indicating that the network has little influence on specific industries while individual industries have a strong impact on each other. The degree, weighted degree and betweenness centrality are used to determine the main industries in the network. Key industries are characterized by large degrees that play a key role in the network, of which the mining and washing of coal, the production and supply of electric and heat power, construction, and the rolling of steel have stronger influences on the network. Moreover, the production and supply of electric power and heat power, the manufacture of automobiles and farming are the intermediaries of the network. Finally, we use a block-modeling method to decompose the collection of 135 Chinese industries into seven communities. The community of coal-related industries is the core of the network, which transfers embodied exergy to every other community, whereas the community of steel-related industries is also important, forming the base of the rest of the network.}}

For both models, we study the sequence of clogged roads up to the traffic gridlock and display the fragilities of the network. In the electrical model, by increasing the external potential, resistors burn out, as the voltage drop between the ends increases above a certain threshold. Analyzing both models, we observed some power-law functions that occur only near a traffic gridlock as well as the dependence on topological features of the network and influence on flux and the robustness in Apollonian networks of different generations.}}

Progress in the interdisciplinary field of modern network science has introduced many new concepts, analytical tools and models which allow a systematic interpretation of multivariate data obtained from structural and functional MRI, EEG and MEG. However, progress in this field has been hampered by the absence of a simple, unbiased method to represent the essential features of brain networks, and to compare these across different conditions, behavioural states and neuropsychiatric/neurological diseases. One promising solution to this problem is to represent brain networks by a minimum spanning tree (MST), a unique acyclic subgraph that connects all nodes and maximizes a property of interest such as synchronization between brain areas. We explain how the global and local properties of an MST can be characterized. We then review early and more recent applications of the MST to EEG and MEG in epilepsy, development, schizophrenia, brain tumours, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and show how MST characterization performs compared to more conventional graph analysis. Finally, we illustrate how MST characterization allows representation of observed brain networks in a space of all possible tree configurations and discuss how this may simplify the construction of simple generative models of normal and abnormal brain network organization.}}

We propose a fast algorithm which utilize the preiously-calculated results to accelerate the latter calculation. Simple optimization strategies are also proposed with consideration of characteristics of scale-free complex networks. Our experimental results show that the average running time of our algorithm is lower than the Dijkstra's algorithm by a factor relating to the connection probability in random networks of ER model. The performance of our algorithm is significantly better than the Dijkstra's algorithm in scale-free networks generated by the AB model. The results show that the time complexity is reduced to about O(n2.4) in scalefree complex networks. When the optimization strategies are applied, the algorithm performance is further improved slightly in scale-free networks.}}

In this study, we examined a connection network of successive events in the Taiwan seismicity, in an attempt to shed lights on the behavior of the actual earthquake network. The revealed nature of connection is indeed quite different from the nearest-neighbor interaction usually presumed in most conventional seismicity modeling.

Therefore global optimization methods involving both structural and parametric degrees of freedom can currently not handle this problem and find realizable optimal energy efficiency in practice. To tackle the network synthesis problem, we proposed the following design and optimization approaches. First we apply an inverse design methods based on temperature collocation which substantially reduces the problem dimension. This method identifies the design feasibility keeping final product purities. Second, we developed hybrid genetic algorithm, in which stochastic GA elements can be combined with a local deterministic search. At first stage, GA explores the design space until individual network solutions begin to coalesce and confines the region with niche technique. The gradient-based local optimizer refines a solution to local optimality. This hybrid scheme enables to find out all global and local solutions and thus improves computation speed and accuracy of the solutions. Our novel methods allow the global search for feasible, effective and optimal energy efficient designs of the complex distillation column network in a fully automatic fashion. We used the rigorous commercial flowsheet simulator AspenPlus to validate the result and both results are very close each other. The automatic and rigorous flowsheet synthesis is apt to systematically address industrial-size process design problems such as the synthesis of energy-efficient separation networks, layout of biorefineries with novel feedstocks or sustainable process for reduction of greenhouse gases emissions.}}

In order to design an effective ranking method, we proposed a semi-local centrality measure as a tradeoff between the low-relevant degree centrality and other time-consuming measures. We use the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model to evaluate the performance by using the spreading rate and the number of infected nodes. Simulations on four real networks show that our method can well identify influential nodes.}}

Danila et al. propose a packet routing strategy in which, instead of shortest paths, they used efficient paths, which are the paths with the minimum total summations of weights assigned to nodes in the respective paths. They use a heuristic algorithm in which the weights are updated step by step by using the information of betweenness of each node in every step and the respective total summations of weights for paths through the nodes with large degrees become comparatively large. Thus passage through such nodes, where congestion almost occurs, is likely to be avoided in their algorithm. The convergence time by their algorithm is, however, quite long. In this paper, we propose a new efficient heuristic algorithm which balances traffic on networks by achieving minimization of the maximum betweenness in the much smaller number of iteration steps for convergence than that by the algorithm of Danila et al.}}

We consider that local and global properties of a node as the degree and relative average degree of the node respectively. We prove that the degree distribution of complex networks generated by CDPAM follow power law with exponent lies in the interval [2,3] and the expected diameter grows logarithmically with the size of new nodes added to the initial small network. Numerical results show that the expected diameter stabilizes when alike weights to the local and global properties are assigned by the new nodes. Computing various measures including clustering coefficient, assortativity, number of triangles, algebraic connectivity, spectral radius, we show that the proposed model replicates properties of real networks when alike weights are given to local and global property. Finally, we observe that the BA model is a limiting case of CDPAM when new nodes tend to give large weight to the local property compared to the weight given to the global property during link formation.}}

Additionally, the spatial average, the nearest and natural neighbor along with the inverse distance and square distance weighted average interpolation methods are employed and the results are compared for the area of study. These schemes utilize wind speed measurements from six meteorological sites and they are evaluated for their predictive ability in each location using the "leave-one-out cross-validation" technique. The predictive accuracy of the neural network which incorporates wind direction in the form of wind vector as an input is found to be statistically superior compared with the five traditional interpolation schemes and with the network which utilizes only the wind speed intensity. An insight on the underlying input–output function approximation of the neural networks is obtained by examining their ability to incorporate the mean wind variability characteristics of the study area.}}

The simplest form of the community structure problem is the partitioning of unweighted and undirected networks into disjoint communities. However, module detection in weighted networks or communities with overlapping modules may lead to more realistic applications. Optimisation of the modularity metric is a popular method for community structure detection (Newman and Girvan 2004) and here we extend its use to propose mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models for (i) partitioning of weighted networks and (ii) detection of overlapping communities. The mathematical programming nature of the methods proposed provide users with an adaptability that may not be available in alternative modelling frameworks. Overall, we show that our methods improve existing methodologies in terms of applicability and adaptability and offer a versatile solution to the community detection problem.}}

This paper presents a vertices similarity probability (VSP) model to find community structure without the priori knowledge of the type of complex network structure. As vertices in the same community have similar properties, the VSP model uses vertices similarity to find community structure which is a unified algorithm and can be used in any network without knowing the type of network structure. As "Common neighbor index" has been proved to be an effective index for vertices similarity, it is used to measure the vertices similarity probability. Then, we give the method to determine the number of communities using matrix perturbation theory. We apply the model to find community structure in real-world networks and artificial networks. The experimental results show that the VSP model is applicable to both unipartite networks and bipartite networks, and is able to find the community structure successfully without using the type of network structure.}}

The advantages of this method are its simplicity, accuracy, and low computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm both on real-world networks and on benchmark graphs.

To aid them in their efforts, it is essential to devise techniques that can automatically identify concepts warranting special attention. "Complex" concepts, which by their very nature are more difficult to model, fall neatly into this category. A special kind of grouping, called a partial-area, is utilized in the characterization of complex concepts. In particular, the complex concepts that are the focus of this work are those appearing in intersections of multiple partial-areas and are thus referred to as overlapping concepts. In a companion paper, an automatic methodology for identifying and partitioning the entire collection of overlapping concepts into disjoint, singly-rooted groups, that are more manageable to work with and comprehend, has been presented. The partitioning methodology formed the foundation for the development of an abstraction network for the overlapping concepts called a disjoint partial-area taxonomy. This new disjoint partial-area taxonomy offers a collection of semantically uniform partial-areas and is exploited herein as the basis for a novel auditing methodology. The review of the overlapping concepts is done in a top-down order within semantically uniform groups. These groups are themselves reviewed in a top-down order, which proceeds from the less complex to the more complex overlapping concepts. The results of applying the methodology to SNOMED's Specimen hierarchy are presented. Hypotheses regarding error ratios for overlapping concepts and between different kinds of overlapping concepts are formulated. Two phases of auditing the Specimen hierarchy for two releases of SNOMED are reported on. With the use of the double bootstrap and Fisher's exact test (two-tailed), the auditing of concepts and especially roots of overlapping partial-areas is shown to yield a statistically significant higher proportion of errors.}}

Zealots make the magnetization of the system to vary exponentially with time. We obtain that on SF networks, increasing the zealots' population, Z , exponentially increases the rate of consensus achievement. The time needed for the system to reach a desired magnetization, shows a power-law dependence on Z . As well, we obtain that the decay time of the order parameter shows a power-law dependence on Z . We also investigate the role of zealots' degree on the rate of ordering process and finally, we analyze the effect of network's randomness on the efficiency of zealots. Moving from a regular to a random network, the re-wiring probability P r w increases. We show that with increasing P r w , the efficiency of zealots for reducing the consensus achievement time increases. The rate of consensus is compared with the rate of ordering for different re-wiring probabilities of WS networks.}}

In a classical ESN, its dynamic reservoir (DR) has a sparse and random topology, but the performance of ESN with its DR taking another kind of topology is still unknown. So based on complex network theory, three new ESNs are proposed and investigated in this paper. The small-world topology, scale-free topology and the mixed topology of small-world effect and scale-free feature are considered in these new ESNs. We studied the relationship between DR architecture and prediction capability. In our simulation experiments, we used two widely used time series to test the prediction performance among the new ESNs and classical ESN, and used the independent identically distributed (i.i.d) time series to analyze the short-term memory (STM) capability. We answer the following questions: What are the differences of these ESNs in the prediction performance? Can the spectral radius of the internal weights matrix be wider? What is the short-term memory capability? The experimental results show that the proposed new ESNs have better prediction performance, wider spectral radius and almost the same STM capacity as classical ESN's.}}

These findings open the possibility to optimize and control the structure of complex networks by manipulating rich-club connections.

By introducing an improved discontinuous Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), new delay-dependent synchronization criteria are obtained using Wirtinger׳s integral inequality and mixed convex combination, which fully utilize the upper bound on variable sampling interval and the sawtooth structure information of varying input delay. The derived criteria are less conservative than the existing ones. In addition, the desired sampled-data controllers are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.}}

Based on the multi-organizational responses to the Ya'an Earthquake, April 20, 2013, China, we identify the emergence of the response network, and analyze the interactions among organizations and information infrastructure supporting such interactions. Our findings suggest that a network structure, with expansion in both size and variation, emerged after the Lushan Earthquake. Emergence of this response network is determined by not only interorganizational interactions among public organizations and public service entities, but also cross sector interactions between public organizations and private and nonprofit organizations. However, interactions are insufficient not only between public organizations and private and nonprofit organizations, but also among public organizations at the municipal and county levels, particularly in the initial stage of the response. The lack of cross sector interactions between public organizations and private and nonprofit organizations limits command and coordination of the whole network in achieving a collective performance. Accordingly, in information processes, communication infrastructure was not sufficiently strong to support these two types of interactions. Policy recommendations are offered to improve preparedness of the response plans, emergence of response networks, as well as information infrastructure to support interactions among organizations in disaster operations.}}

Moreover, the schemes can achieve balanced loads, avoid hot-spots and single points of failure, reduce storage and maintenance costs, and offer ranking mechanisms for matching objects. The main focus is on a thorough comparative study on these index schemes from the following perspectives: query expressiveness, encoding effectiveness, load balance, and search performance.}}

The study shows that the present Chinese domestic airline network is a small-world network with degree distribution obeying a double power law. Compared with the network structure in 2005, its average mimimum path length and clustering coefficient decrease with the increases of node and average degree. The node throughput, distance strengths and degree correspond to the positive power law. The effect of degree on throughput is more significant than that on distance. The betweenness centrality and degree positively correlated with fluctuations. The degree-degree correlation of the present network is negative, which shows the nodes with large degree prefer to be connected to other nodes with small degree and the effect of throughput on connection between nodes is greater than the effect of distance. When the degree value is high, the clustering coefficient distribution on degree obviously follows power-law. It indicates that the group structure centering around airports with large degree has appeared in Chinese airline network.}}

The use of whole-genome approaches such as microarray expression profiling and, more recently, RNA-sequence analysis of transcript abundance has allowed an unprecedented look at the workings of the genome. However, the accurate derivation of such high-throughput data and their analysis in terms of biological function has been critical to truly leveraging the postgenomic revolution. This chapter will describe an approach that focuses on the use of gene networks to both organize and interpret genomic expression data. Such networks, derived from statistical analysis of large genomic datasets and the application of multiple bioinformatics data resources, potentially allow the identification of key control elements for networks associated with human disease, and thus may lead to derivation of novel therapeutic approaches. However, as discussed in this chapter, the leveraging of such networks cannot occur without a thorough understanding of the technical and statistical factors influencing the derivation of genomic expression data. Thus, while the catch phrase may be "it's the network … stupid," the understanding of factors extending from RNA isolation to genomic profiling technique, multivariate statistics, and bioinformatics are all critical to defining fully useful gene networks for study of complex biology.}}

After analyzing and comparing a variety of objective functions that have been used or can potentially be used for community detection, this paper exploits the concept of correlation between objective which charcterizes the relationship between any two objective functions. Through extensive experiments on both artifical and real networks, this paper demonstrates that a combination of two negatively correlated objectives under the multi-objective framework usually leads to remarkably better performance compared with either of the orignal single objectives, including even many popular algorithms..}}

The complex network theory, being one of new research tools, opens new perspectives on syntax properties of the language.

Specifically, although statistical properties typical for complex networks can be observed in all syntactic networks, the impact of syntax itself on these properties is still unclear. The aim of the present study is to shed more light on the role of syntax in the syntactic network structure. In particular, we concentrate on the impact of the syntactic function of a verb in the sentence on the complex network structure. Verbs play the decisive role in the sentence structure ("local" importance). From this fact we hypothesize the importance of verbs in the complex network ("global" importance). The importance of verb in the complex network is assessed by the number of links which are directed from the node representing verb to other nodes in the network. Six languages (Catalan, Czech, Dutch, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese) were used for testing the hypothesis.}}

We then derive mean-field equations to describe their dynamics in homogeneous networks and conduct the steady-state analysis. We also introduce the self-resistance parameter τ , and study the influence of this parameter on rumor spreading. Numerical simulations are performed to compare the SICR model with the SIR model and the adjusted-SICR model, respectively, and we investigate the spreading peak of the rumor and the final size of the rumor with various parameters. Simulation results are congruent exactly with the theoretical analysis. The experiment reveals some interesting patterns of rumor spreading involved with counterattack force.}}

A chiral, reduced salen ligand, salan R,R-H21 with pendant ester functionalities has been synthesized. Its copper(II) complex, [Cu(R,R-1)], has been isolated, and its crystal structure determined by X-ray crystallography. Hydrolysing the ester groups of R,R-H21 to carboxylic acids yields R,R-H42 as the hydrochloride salt R,R-H42·2HCl. Treatment of R,R-H42·2HCl with copper(II) acetate in the presence of triethylamine yields the complex [Cu(R,R-H22)]n and X-ray structural analysis reveals that this consists of a 2D polymeric network. Each copper(II) center is bound within the near square-planar N2O2 donor set of the Schiff base ligand [R,R-H22]2 − and pendant carboxylic acid groups of adjacent units coordinate through the CO2H carbonyl units in the axial sites of the copper ion to complete an axially distorted octahedral coordination environment. The sheets are stacked via interdigitation of the cyclohexyl domains, giving an overall porous assembly containing carboxylic acid functionalities. This has proven to be an effective strategy for adding the dimensionality of metal–organic complexes by carboxylic acid functionalization of ligands.}}

Generally, the development and progression of complex diseases include three stages: normal stage, pre-disease stage, and disease stage. For diagnosis and treatment, it is necessary to reveal dynamical organizations of molecular modules during the early development of the disease from the pre-disease stage to the disease stage. Thus, we develop a new framework, i.e. we identify the modules presenting at the pre-disease stage (pre-disease module) based on dynamical network biomarkers (DNBs), detect the modules observed at the advanced stage (disease-responsive module) by cross-tissue gene expression analysis, and finally find the modules related to early development (progressive module) by progressive module network (PMN). As an application example, we used this new method to analyze the gene expression data for NOD mouse model of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). After the comprehensive comparison with the previously reported milestone molecules, we found by PMN: (1) the critical transition point was identified and confirmed by the tissue-specific modules or DNBs relevant to the pre-disease stage, which is considered as an earlier event during disease development and progression; (2) several key tissues-common modules related to the disease stage were significantly enriched on known T1DM associated genes with the rewired association networks, which are marks of later events during T1DM development and progression; (3) the tissue-specific modules associated with early development revealed several common essential progressive genes, and a few of pathways representing the effect of environmental factors during the early T1DM development. Totally, we developed a new method to detect the critical stage and the key modules during the disease occurrence and progression, and show that the pre-disease modules can serve as warning signals for the pre-disease state (e.g. T1DM early diagnosis) whereas the progressive modules can be used as the therapy targets for the disease state (e.g. advanced T1DM), which were also validated by experimental data.}}

This activation function is a special Möbius transformation classified as reflection. It is bounded outside of the unit disk and has partial continuous derivatives but not differentiable since it does not satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equalities. However, the fixed points set of this function is a circle. Therefore, we employ this function to a specific complex valued Hopfield neural network (CVHNN) and increase the number of fixed points of the CVHNN. Using of this activation function leads us also to guarantee the existence of fixed points of the CVHNN. It is shown that the fixed points are all asymptotically stable states of the CVHNN which indicates that the information capacity is enlarged.}}

Without assuming the symmetry and irreducibility of the coupling matrix, sufficient conditions of lag synchronization are obtained by adding controllers to a part of nodes. Particularly, the following two questions are solved: (1) How many controllers are needed to pin a coupled complex network to a homogeneous solution? (2) How should we distribute these controllers? Finally, a simple example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theory.}}

Measurements of geographical lengths of transmission lines, the mixing of generators and loads, the weighted clustering coefficient, as well as the organization of edge conductance weights show a complex architecture quite different from random-graph models usually considered. In particular, we introduce a parametrized mixing matrix to characterize the mixing pattern of generators and loads in the Florida Grid, which is intermediate between the random mixing case and the semi-bipartite case where generator–generator transmission lines are forbidden. Our observations motivate an investigation of optimization (design) principles leading to the structural organization of power grids. We thus propose two network optimization models for the Florida Grid as a case study. Our results show that the Florida Grid is optimized not only by reducing the construction cost (measured by the total length of power lines), but also through reducing the total pairwise edge resistance in the grid, which increases the robustness of power transmission between generators and loads against random line failures. We then embed our models in spatial areas of different aspect ratios and study how this geometric factor affects the network structure, as well as the box-counting fractal dimension of the grids generated by our models.}}

Delineation of the structures and modelling of the infill is therefore very important in relation to groundwater mapping. Typically, borehole information is too sparse to enable a detailed delineation of the structures, whereas densely covering airborne electromagnetic data have proven to be very useful for this. In the last decades, the mapping approach has been studied carefully, but the 3D modelling of the valley structures has not been described to the same degree yet. In this study, we create a 3D geological model of an area that is characterised by a complex network of buried valleys mapped with a spatially dense airborne electromagnetic survey. Due to the comprehensive dataset, the modelling requires formulation of an advanced strategy. This contains a number of steps, where the AEM-derived resistivity data are initially interpreted based on the geological background knowledge to identify the buried valleys and build a conceptual geological model. Secondly, the age relationships between the valleys are established from the valley orientations and their internal cross-cut relationships. Thirdly, the deep erosional surfaces are modelled. Subsequently, the interpreted age relationships are utilised to trim the valley floor surfaces, such that younger valleys cut older. Finally, a voxel model is built and populated with lithofacies and stratigraphical units. The model is constructed as a combined layer-based and voxel model in order to map both the overall structures as well as the lithological variations within the 3D model domain. The final model contains 20 buried valleys that show a complex cross-cut setting that indicate the presence of at least eight valley generations. Most of the valley infills show lithological variations, and the final voxel model thus contains 42 different geological units.}}

They are conventionally classified according to the country they were built, to the style (Roman, classic and contemporary) or to the construction site. In this study, we show that labyrinths can be modeled as complex networks, whose metrics can be used to classify them in terms of their difficulty to find the way out. This is performed by calculating the absorption time, defined as the time it takes for a particle on an internal node to reach an output node through a random walk. The absorption time correlates well with the shortest paths and length of the networks, as expected, and has a very high correlation (Pearson coefficient of 0.97) with the betweenness, therefore allowing one to quantify the level of complexity of any labyrinth. It is shown that the conventional classification is inappropriate to distinguish between labyrinths, because some with very similar properties exist in different countries or were built in distinct time periods. A refined analysis in 77 famous labyrinths indicated that the majority were built for aesthetic purposes, with relatively small absorption times. Furthermore, with the expectation maximization algorithm, we could combine the complex network metrics to identify four clusters of labyrinths that differ in terms of density and shape.}}

Clusters are identified by these methods using various graph theoretic criteria. Most of these methods have been found time consuming due to involvement of preprocessing and post processing tasks. In addition, they do not achieve high precision and recall consistently and simultaneously. Moreover, the existing methods do not employ the idea of core-periphery structural pattern of protein complexes effectively to extract clusters. In this paper, we introduce a clustering method named CPCA based on a recent observation by researchers that a protein complex in a PPI network is arranged as a relatively dense core region and additional proteins weakly connected to the core. CPCA uses two connectivity criterion functions to identify core and peripheral regions of the cluster. To locate initial node of a cluster we introduce a measure called DNQ (Degree based Neighborhood Qualification) index that evaluates tendency of the node to be part of a cluster. CPCA performs well when compared with well-known counterparts. Along with protein complex gold standards, a co-localization dataset has also been used for validation of the results.}}

Nevertheless, this architecture suffers from a highly unstable topology since links between nodes break constantly due to users' movement. Mobility has a paramount influence on the network topology. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the impact of mobility in MANETs. In this work, we perform a thorough analysis on how mobility shape the behavior of MANETs. Our range of observation varies from general MANETs composed of walking users to a next generation of MANETs formed by vehicles moving either in a city environment or in a highway scenario, namely Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs).

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to establish directed weighted accident causation network (DWACN) for the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) in the UK, which is based on complex network and using event chains of accidents. DWACN is composed of 109 nodes which denote causal factors and 260 directed weighted edges which represent complex interrelationships among factors. The statistical properties of directed weighted complex network are applied to reveal the critical factors, the key event chains and the important classes in DWACN. Analysis results demonstrate that DWACN has characteristics of small-world networks with short average path length and high weighted clustering coefficient, and display the properties of scale-free networks captured by that the cumulative degree distribution follows an exponential function. This modeling and analysis method can assist us to discover the latent rules of accidents and feature of faults propagation to reduce accidents. This paper is further development on the research of accident analysis methods using complex network.}}

The newly presented dynamical network model includes both intrinsic disturbance of single node and communication noise over the network connections, which appear typically in a network environment. Single controller is pinned into one of the nodes for the exponential stabilization of dynamical network, and the prescribed performance constraint is satisfied. The reason why only one controller is valid for stabilization of dynamical network is the full utilization of network's local connections. One important feature of this paper is the introduction of the performance constraint concept into the stabilization of complex dynamical network with intrinsic and communication noises. The derived criteria are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are easy to be verified by resorting to recently developed algorithm. Numerical example is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.}}

Unlike existing complex network models, the information transmission between the nodes is assumed to have an imperfect physical condition — only partial information can be transmitted. Furthermore, for varying connections, the partly transmitted information can be completely distinct. This communication constraint makes the network harder to achieve synchronization. To reflect a more practical situation, we consider the complex networks with two typical kinds of inner coupling matrix: diagonal matrix and lower triangle matrix. By using an efficient decomposition method, some synchronization criteria are then derived for the complex networks with partial information transmission. Finally, a complex network with chaotic dynamics is constructed as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.}}

Two-layer complex networks with a homogeneous physical topology are found to be more tolerant to congestion. Moreover, simulation results show that the heterogeneity of logical and physical topologies makes the packet-delivery process of two-layer networks more efficient in the free-flow state, without the occurrence of traffic congestion.}}

On a mid-level structure, countries are classified into three communities that reflect the structure of the "core/periphery" using the weighted extremal optimisation algorithm and the coarse graining process. On a micro-level, countries' rankings are provided with the aid of network's node centralities, which presents world trade as a closed, imbalanced, diversified and multi-polar development. Further, we firstly introduce the improved bootstrap percolation to simulate cascading influences following the breaking down of bilateral trade relations. We find that the breakdown of EU's export relations can more easily form a cascading reaction, which would result in a global collapse of world trade. All the results highlight the important positions of the EU, USA and Japan in the international trade system, which plays a positive role in promoting the world economy.}}

We also consider the adaptive rewiring of edges, which encourages disconnections from and discourages connections to infected nodes and eventually leads to the isolation of the infected from the susceptible with only a small number of links between them. We find that while the threshold of epidemic spreading remains unchanged and prevalence increases in the fitness rewiring dynamics, meeting of the epidemic threshold is delayed and prevalence is reduced (if adaptive dynamics are included). To understand these different behaviors, we introduce a new measure called the "mean change of effective links" and find that creation and deletion of pathways for pathogen transmission are the dominant factors in fitness and adaptive rewiring dynamics, respectively.}}

Statistical characterizations of these networks aim to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small number of network measures. Important functional network measures include measures of modularity (measures of the goodness with which a network is optimally partitioned into functional subgroups) and measures of centrality (measures of the functional influence of individual brain regions). Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity, but are associated with several important methodological problems. These problems include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity partitions of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for testing hypotheses of association between observed nontrivial network properties and simple weighted connectivity properties. In this study we describe a set of methods to overcome these problems. Specifically, we generalize measures of modularity and centrality to fully connected and weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate high-modularity partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity null model of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary measures of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) networks from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access repository of resting-state functional MRI datasets. Our methods may allow more sound and reliable characterizations and comparisons of functional brain networks across conditions and subjects.}}

The concept named "average impulsive interval" with "elasticity number" of impulsive sequence is introduced to get a less conservative synchronization criterion. By comparing with existing results, in which maximum or minimum of impulsive intervals are used to derive the synchronization criterion, the proposed synchronization criterion increases (or decreases) the impulse distances, which leads to the reduction of the control cost (or enhance the robustness of anti-interference) as the most important characteristic of impulsive synchronization techniques. It is discovered in our criterion that "elasticity number" has influence on synchronization of delayed complex dynamical networks but has no influence on that of non-delayed complex dynamical networks. Numerical simulations including a small-world network coupled with delayed Chua's circuit are given to show the effectiveness and less conservativeness of the theoretical results.}}

In this paper we present a decision tool to aid train planners obtain quickly good quality routes and schedules for short time horizons (e.g., daily) to better manage the limited track capacity available for train movements. This decision tool is made up of an integer programming (IP)-based capacity management model and a genetic algorithm (GA)-based solution procedure. The capacity management model assigns trains to routes based on the statistical expectation of running times in order to balance the railroad traffic. The GA procedure determines the best initial routes and release times for trains to depart from origin stations and enter a network, given travel time estimates across aggregated sections of a network. We test our modeling technique by comparing the travel times obtained for a network in Los Angeles using these initial routes and release times, with those obtained from a simulation model, presented by Lu et al. (2004), which has been shown to be representative of the real-world travel times. Our experimental results show that our recommended solution procedure is capable of lowering travel times, as estimated by Lu et al. (2004), by up to 20%.}}

By calculating the shortest path and proposing a key degree node model, the role of each influencing factor during algal blooms was evaluated. Based on years of on-site monitoring data (collected from 1992 to 2000) concerning the Han River, a statistical characteristic function G that reflected the relationship between the statistical characteristics of dominant algae blooming and the degree of algal blooms pollution was proposed. The results indicate that the proposed function G is capable of effectively and semi-quantitatively characterizing the outbreak time and the duration of algal blooms. If the value of G in a body of water is less than 32.6, the body of water will outbreak an algal bloom. An increasingly smaller of G value indicates a greater degree of algal blooms pollution and longer bloom duration.}}

By establishing the extended Halanay differential inequality on impulsive delayed dynamical systems, some simple yet generic sufficient conditions for global exponential synchronization of the impulsive controlled delayed dynamical networks are derived analytically. Compared with some existing works, the distinctive features of these sufficient conditions indicate two aspects: on the one hand, these sufficient conditions can provide an effective impulsive control scheme to synchronize an arbitrary given delayed dynamical network to a desired synchronization state even if the original given network may be asynchronous itself. On the other hand, the controlled synchronization state can be selected as a weighted average of all the states in the network for the purpose of practical control strategy, which reveals the contributions and influences of various nodes in synchronization seeking processes of the dynamical networks. It is shown that impulses play an important role in making the delayed dynamical networks globally exponentially synchronized. Furthermore, the results are applied to a typical nearest-neighbor unidirectional time-delay coupled networks composed of chaotic FHN neuron oscillators, and numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.}}

In this article, for a number of real-world as well as Watts–Strogatz model networks, we investigated the profile of the network small-worldness as random failures, i.e. errors, or systematic failures, i.e. attacks, occurred in the nodes. In errors nodes are randomly removed along with all their tipping edges, while in attacks the nodes with highest degrees are removed from the network. Interestingly, in many cases, the small-worldness of violated networks increased as more nodes underwent an attack. This indicates an important role of the hub nodes in controlling the small-worldness of Watts–Strogatz networks. The profile of changes in the small-worldness as a result of errors/attacks was independent of network size, while it was influenced by average degree and rewiring probability of Watts–Strogatz model. We also found that the pattern of the changes of the small-worldness in real-world networks is completely different than that of the Watts–Strogatz networks. Therefore, although Watts–Strogatz model is often used for constructing networks with small-world property, the resulting networks have different properties compared to real-world ones in terms of robustness in the small-worldness index against errors/attacks.}}

Subconsciously, we rely increasingly on network management systems. These systems allow us to, in general, maintain, manage, configure, scale, adapt, modify, edit, protect, and enhance the main distributed systems. Their role is secondary and is unknown and transparent to the users. They provide the necessary support to maintain the distributed systems whose services we use every day. If we do not consider network management systems during the development stage of distributed systems, then there could be serious consequences or even total failures in the development of the distributed system. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the management of the systems within the design of the distributed systems and to systematise their design to minimise the impact of network management in distributed systems projects. In this paper, we present a framework that allows the design of network management systems systematically. To accomplish this goal, formal modelling tools are used for modelling different views sequentially proposed of the same problem. These views cover all the aspects that are involved in the system; based on process definitions for identifying responsible and defining the involved agents to propose the deployment in a distributed architecture that is both feasible and appropriate.}}

abstract = {Complex partial seizures – which often arise in the temporal lobes – are the most common seizures in adults and are often drug resistant. They involve transient episodes of impaired consciousness with behavioural arrest. Identifying the neural substrate for these common and drug-resistant attacks will be valuable not only for understanding epileptogenic networks, but also for evolving new pharmacologic or stimulation paradigms designed for complex partial seizures. Dr. Hal Blumenfeld at Yale University has offered a testable hypothesis concerning the neural substrate of complex partial seizures. Blumenfeld postulates (2012): (1) that focal discharge arises somewhere in the brain, typically in the temporal lobes; (2) that the focal discharge spreads to subcortical structures that have strong inhibitory outputs, such as the septal nuclei; and (3) that the discharge in these structures suppresses activity in the arousal systems of the upper brain stem and diencephalon. Suppression of the arousal systems leads to unconsciousness, which is signaled by the onset of behavioural arrest and slow waves in the neocortical EEG. Blumenfeld's hypothesis has not yet been tested in the amygdala-kindling model – the most widely used and drug-validated animal model of complex partial seizures. Tests involving the Blumenfeld hypothesis and amygdala-kindled rats are now underway in our laboratory. We predict that behavioural arrest in kindled animals will correlate with the onset of slow waves in the rat neocortex. We also predict that the behavioural arrest will not be suppressed by anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), since AEDs do not suppress complex partial seizures in patients or the kindled amygdala focus in rats (Albright and Burnham, 1980).}}

In first phase, fuzzy clustering was done to reduce the number of segments in training pattern. After that, FFT values of Doppler signals were calculated for pre-processing and then obtained values, which include real and imaginary components, were used as the inputs of the CVNN for classification of Doppler signals. Classification results of FCCVNN were evaluated by the different performance evaluation criterion in literature. It shows that Doppler signals were classified successfully with 100% correct classification rate using the proposed method. Moreover, the rates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 100% using FCCVNN method. These results were seen to be appropriate with the expected results that are derived from physician's direct diagnosis. This method would be assisted the physician to make the final decision.}}

Measures for overall network structure include degree distribution, average path length and clustering coefficient. Centrality metrics for individual cities are degree, closeness and betweenness, representing a node's location advantage as being directly connected to others, being accessible to others, and being the intermediary between others, respectively. Results indicate that the ATNC has a cumulative degree distribution captured by an exponential function, and displays some small-world (SW) network properties with an average path length of 2.23 and a clustering coefficient of 0.69. All three centrality indices are highly correlated with socio-economic indicators of cities such as air passenger volume, population, and gross regional domestic product (GRDP). This confirms that centrality captures a crucial aspect of location advantage in the ATNC and has important implications in shaping the spatial pattern of economic activities. Most small and low-degree airports are directly connected to the largest cities with the best centrality and bypass their regional centers, and therefore sub-networks in the ATNC are less developed except for Kunming in the southwest and Urumchi in the northwest because of their strategic locations for geographic and political reasons. The ANTC is relatively young, and not as efficient and well-developed as that of the US.}}

We systematically carried out oil–gas–water three-phase flow experiments for measuring the time series of flow signals, which is studied in terms of the mapping from time series to complex networks. Two network mapping methods are proposed for the analysis and identification of flow pattern dynamics, i.e. Flow Pattern Complex Network (FPCN) and Fluid Dynamic Complex Network (FDCN). Through detecting the community structure of FPCN based on K-means clustering, distinct flow patterns can be successfully distinguished and identified. A number of FDCN's under different flow conditions are constructed in order to reveal the dynamical characteristics of three-phase flows. The network information entropy of FDCN is sensitive to the transition among different flow patterns, which can be used to characterize nonlinear dynamics of the three-phase flow. These interesting and significant findings suggest that complex networks can be a potentially powerful tool for uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of oil–gas–water three-phase flows.}}

Subsequently, a graph-theoretic framework for network analysis and control is developed, and connecting links are built to an equivalent analysis using singular perturbations.

abstract = {Abstract The octanol/water partition coefficient, logP, is one of the most important physico-chemical parameters for the development of new metal-based anticancer drugs with improved pharmacokinetic properties. This study addresses an issue with the absence of publicly available models to predict logP of Pt(IV) complexes. Following data collection and subsequent development of models based on 187 complexes from literature, we validate new and previously published models on a new set of 11 Pt(II) and 35 Pt(IV) complexes, which were kept blind during the model development step. The error of the consensus model, 0.65 for Pt(IV) and 0.37 for Pt(II) complexes, indicates its good accuracy of predictions. The lower accuracy for Pt(IV) complexes was attributed to experimental difficulties with logP measurements for some poorly-soluble compounds. This model was developed using general-purpose descriptors such as extended functional groups, molecular fragments and E-state indices. Surprisingly, models based on quantum-chemistry calculations provided lower prediction accuracy. We also found that all the developed models strongly overestimate logP values for the three complexes measured in the presence of DMSO. Considering that DMSO is frequently used as a solvent to store chemicals, its effect should not be overlooked when logP measurements by means of the shake flask method are performed. The final models are freely available at http://ochem.eu/article/76903.}}

Moreover, the structure of the CdLI2 was determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. CdLI2 crystallizes in a triclinic system with space group P 1 ¯ . The molecular structure shows distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry. The CH....π and π–π stacking interactions connect the molecules to a supramolecular network. The thermal properties of the compounds were investigated from the room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and decomposition activation parameters were evaluated from the TG/DTG plots. Antibacterial/antifungal activities of the compounds were screened by the disk diffusion method against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and the fungi strain Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial activities were determined for all compounds and the complexation was found to enhance the inhibitory activity. Finally, the DNA cleavage potential of the compounds was investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis method.}}

In particular, Injectivity Theory, including network concordance [36] and the Jacobian Determinant Criterion [43], a "Lifting Theorem" for steady states [26] and the comprehensive results of Müller and Regensburger [31] on complex balanced equilibria are discussed. A partial extension of a recent Emulation Theorem of Cardelli for mass action systems [3] is derived for a subclass of power law kinetic systems. However, it is also shown that the GMA and S-system models of human purine metabolism [10] do not display the reactant-determined kinetics assumed by Müller and Regensburger and hence only a subset of BST models can be handled with their approach. Moreover, since the reaction networks underlying many BST models are not weakly reversible, results for non-complex balanced equilibria are also needed.}}

In other words, the transfer station corresponding to this root plays the most important role in the urban rail transit networks.}}

abstract = {Summary Dosage compensation mechanisms provide a paradigm to study the contribution of chromosomal conformation toward targeting and spreading of epigenetic regulators over a specific chromosome. By using Hi-C and 4C analyses, we show that high-affinity sites (HAS), landing platforms of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, are enriched around topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries on the X chromosome and harbor more long-range contacts in a sex-independent manner. Ectopically expressed roX1 and roX2 RNAs target HAS on the X chromosome in trans and, via spatial proximity, induce spreading of the MSL complex in cis, leading to increased expression of neighboring autosomal genes. We show that the MSL complex regulates nucleosome positioning at HAS, therefore acting locally rather than influencing the overall chromosomal architecture. We propose that the sex-independent, three-dimensional conformation of the X chromosome poises it for exploitation by the MSL complex, thereby facilitating spreading in males.}}

Compared to the existing algorithms based on the SBM (their time complexities are O ( m c 2 ) , where m and c are the number of edges and clusters), the algorithms of mixture model are capable of dealing with networks with a large number of communities more efficiently due to their O ( m c ) time complexity. However, the algorithms of mixture model using expectation maximization (EM) technique are still too slow to deal with real million-node networks, since they compute hidden variables on the entire network in each iteration. In this paper, an online variational EM algorithm is designed to improve the efficiency of the EM algorithms. In each iteration, our online algorithm samples a node and estimates its cluster memberships only by its adjacency links, and model parameters are then estimated by the memberships of the sampled node and old model parameters obtained in the previous iteration. The provided online algorithm updates model parameters subsequently by the links of a new sampled node and explores the general structure of massive and growing networks with millions of nodes and hundreds of clusters in hours. Compared to the relevant algorithms on synthetic and real networks, the proposed online algorithm costs less with little or no degradation of accuracy. Results illustrate that the presented algorithm offers a good trade-off between precision and efficiency.}}

Our analytical results are given in terms of basic quantities related to the network structure and coupling frustration. In addition to fully heterogeneous coupling, where each individual interaction is allowed to be distinct, we also consider partially heterogeneous coupling and homogeneous coupling in which the coupling functions are either unique to each oscillator or identical for all network interactions, respectively. We demonstrate the validity of our theory with numerical simulations of multiple network models, and highlight the interesting effects that various coupling choices and network models have on the total erosion of synchronization. Finally, we consider some special network structures with well-known spectral properties, which allows us to derive further analytical results.}}

abstract = {Abstract The performance of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA)-3B42 version 7 product is assessed over north-eastern Iberia, a region with considerable topographical gradients and complexity. Precipitation characteristics from a dense network of 656 rain gauges, spanning the period from 1998 to 2009, are used to evaluate TMPA-3B42 estimates on a daily scale. A set of accuracy estimators, including the relative bias, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Spearman coefficient was used to evaluate the results. The assessment indicates that TMPA-3B42 product is capable of describing the seasonal characteristics of the observed precipitation over most of the study domain. In particular, TMPA-3B42 precipitation agrees well with in situ measurements, with MAE less than 2.5 mm.day− 1, RMSE of 6.4 mm.day− 1 and Spearman correlation coefficients generally above 0.6. TMPA-3B42 provides improved accuracies in winter and summer, whereas it performs much worse in spring and autumn. Spatially, the retrieval errors show a consistent trend, with a general overestimation in regions of low altitude and underestimation in regions of heterogeneous terrain. TMPA-3B42 generally performs well over inland areas, while showing less skill in the coastal regions. A set of skill metrics, including a false alarm ratio [FAR], frequency bias index [FBI], the probability of detection [POD] and threat score [TS], is also used to evaluate TMPA performance under different precipitation thresholds (1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mm.day− 1). The results suggest that TMPA-3B42 retrievals perform well in specifying moderate rain events (5–25 mm.day− 1), but show noticeably less skill in producing both light (&lt; 1 mm.day− 1) and heavy rainfall thresholds (more than 50 mm.day− 1). Given the complexity of the terrain and the associated high spatial variability of precipitation in north-eastern Iberia, the results reveal that TMPA-3B42 data provide an informative addition to the spatial and temporal coverage of rain gauges in the domain, offering insights into characteristics of average precipitation and their spatial patterns. However, the satellite-based precipitation data should be used cautiously for monitoring extreme precipitation events, particularly over complex terrain. An improvement in precipitation algorithms is still needed to more accurately reproduce high precipitation events in areas of heterogeneous topography over this region.}}

abstract = {We extend the study of a model of competitive cluster growth in an active medium from a regular topology to a complex network topology; this is done by adding nonlocal connections with probability p to sites on a regular lattice, thus enabling one to interpolate between regularity and full randomness. The model on networks demonstrates high sensitivity to small changes in initial configurations, which we characterize using damage spreading. The main focus of this paper is, however, the devising of survival strategies through selective networking, to alter the fate of an arbitrarily chosen cluster: whether this be to revive a dying cluster to life, or to make a weak survivor into a stronger one. Although such goals are typically achieved by networking with relatively small clusters, our results suggest that it ought to be possible also to network successfully with peers and larger clusters. The main indication of this comes from the probability distributions of mass differences between survivors and their immediate neighbours, which show an interesting universality; they suggest strategies for winning against the odds.}}

As this contribution will show, this development complicates the identification of work stations that limit the logistic target achievement, because the non-trivial network effects are hard to predict. However, this identification of key work stations is particularly important during the design and operation phase of a manufacturing system, as they allow a cost-optimal system improvement with limited inference on the operation. Our approach discusses the "bottleneck" oriented approach commonly applied today in the context of network effects in manufacturing systems and compares its performance to centrality measures from complex network theory.}}

In the linear regime we observe the appearance of extreme waves, RW-type, that depend solely on the scattering properties of the medium. Interestingly, the addition of nonlinearity does not modify the RW statistics, while as the nonlinearities are increased multiple-filamentation and intensity clamping destroy the RW statistics. Numerical simulations agree nicely with the experimental findings and altogether prove that optical rogue waves are generated through the linear strong scattering in such complex environments.}}

Sometimes, we know in advance that many connections are transitive, and as a consequence, triangles have a specific meaning. Here we propose the study of the modular structure of networks considering triangles as the building blocks of modules. The method generalizes the standard modularity and uses spectral optimization to find its maximum. We compare the partitions obtained with those resulting from the optimization of the standard modularity in several real networks. The results show that the information reported by the analysis of modules of triangles complements the information of the classical modularity analysis.}}

Our evidence reveals that the increased globalization witnessed in the last three decades is not associated with the increased frequency of adverse shocks (in food production). Furthermore, building on recent advances in network analysis that connect the stability of a complex system to its topological features, we find that the world is more interconnected, but not necessarily less stable.}}

The as-fabricated microchannels had a round cross-sectional shape, smooth inner surface, and a diameter from 100 μm down to 9 μm. We demonstrated that these microchannels could be applied to construct complicated, three-dimensional (3D) structures of double helix, knots, as well as interconnection along different directions. Together with the merits of PDMS itself, this flexible and versatile technique showed a promising potential for applications in advanced 3D microfluidic devices, and embedded devices in biosystems.}}

Protein interaction network (PIN) analysis was used to predict its mechanisms of molecular action. Targets of curcumin were obtained based on ChEMBL and STITCH databases. Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) were extracted from the String database. The PIN of curcumin was constructed by Cytoscape and the function modules identified by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis based on molecular complex detection (MCODE). A PIN of curcumin with 482 nodes and 1688 interactions was constructed, which has scale-free, small world and modular properties. Based on analysis of these function modules, the mechanism of curcumin is proposed. Two modules were found to be intimately associated with inflammation. With function modules analysis, the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin were related to SMAD, ERG and mediation by the TLR family. TLR9 may be a potential target of curcumin to treat inflammation.}}

An example of such a pattern is the spontaneous formation of communities or modules. An important question regarding the detection of communities is if these are really representative of any internal network feature. In this work, we explore the community structure of a real complex software network, and correlate this modularity information with the internal dynamical processes that the network is designed to support. Our results show that the dependence between community structure and internal dynamical processes is remarkable, supporting the fact that a community division of this complex network is helpful in the assessment of the underlying dynamical structure, and thus is a useful tool to achieve a simpler representation of the complexity of the network.}}

Although this constraint maintains the node degree distribution consistently in order to reserve the structure of networks, it makes the network structure be lack of flexibility since many network structure always transform in the modern society. Given this consideration, in this paper, we analyze the robustness of networks through setting a new constraint; that is, only the number of edges should be unchanged. Then, we use the link-robustness index ( R l ) as the measure of the network robustness against either random failures or intentional attacks, and make a comparative analysis of network robustness against different types of link attacks. Moreover, we use four types of networks as initial networks, namely scale-free networks, random networks, regular networks, and small-world networks. The experimental results show that the values of robustness measures for the optimized networks starting from different initial networks are similar under different link attacks, but the network topologies may be different. That is to say, networks with different topologies may have similar robustness in terms of the robustness measures. We also find that the optimized networks obtained by one link attack may not robust against other link attacks, sometimes, even weaker than the original networks. Therefore, before building networks, it is better to study which type of link attacks may happen.}}

Shale fabrics that result from bioturbation can produce extensive interconnected networks of biologically redistributed sediment grains within reservoir mudstone facies. The presence of biologically generated heterogeneities may substantially affect reservoir stimulation and thus production from shale facies. This study presents volumetric evaluation of ichnofabrics dominated by Phycosiphon-like and aff. Chondrites, and provides insights into the impact of trace fossils on the rheological and petrophysical characteristics of mudstones. It is calculated that, in addition to creating significant volumes of silty (clay-poor) zones of enhanced porosity and permeability, trace fossils create interpenetrating frameworks of brittle material that reduce communication distances from the low-permeability matrix to the higher permeability silt-rich burrows. Reducing communication distances to less than 1 cm increases the potential for diffusive transport of hydrocarbon molecules from the "tight" matrix to the wellbore-connected volumes. This is because shale ichnofabrics create abundant fracture-prone planes of weakness, and increase the surface area of the interface between the hydrocarbon-rich matrix and porous burrow fills, thereby promoting fluid exchange. Understanding of the three-dimensional characteristics of ichnofabrics may form the basis of future modeling of fracture spacing and complexity that is critical to shale gas reservoir characterization.}}

Specifically, it involves the construction of an exhaustive network of reactions using RING, a rule-based network generator that we have developed, to identify potentially synthesizable compounds from biomass. Subsequently, we: (a) employ quantitative structure–property relationships to query compounds with desired properties, (b) seek different synthesis routes to these compounds, and (c) evaluate these routes in terms of stoichiometric, energetics, and physical parameters such as atom efficiency, enthalpy and free energy change of reactions, and aqueous-organic partition coefficients (Log P) of intermediates. Thermochemistry and Log P are both estimated using group additivity methods, and all property estimations are performed on-the-fly during network generation. We present this method in context of identifying and evaluating heterogeneous catalytic routes from biomass to fatty alcohols that are potential constituents of nonionic surfactants. We also show that group additivity-based estimates of enthalpy of reaction are accurate to within 10 kJ/mol and Log P values reliably predict the relative hydrophobicity of compounds. This method is generic, flexible, reliable and fast in terms of the scope of chemistry that can be considered, properties that can be included, predictive accuracy, and speed of execution; it can, therefore, be used to rapidly screen a large spectrum of compounds and synthesis routes in biomass conversion.}}

abstract = {Abstract Cascading failures in interconnected networks have received more and more attention. In previous works, the basic assumption is that networks share the same capacity redundancy. However, this setting cannot capture the real case very well. Hence, in this paper, we analyze the effect of capacity redundancy disparity on the robustness of interconnected networks. In isolated networks, it is well known that the complex network's robustness can be improved by increasing its capacity redundancy. In interconnected networks where two networks share the same capacity redundancy, the similar result holds. Yet this result is not necessarily true in interconnected networks where two networks are different in capacity redundancy. We find that when the capacity redundancy of one network is fixed, the robustness of the whole system may not follow another network's capacity redundancy. More specifically, when the fixed network's capacity redundancy is very small or very large, the robustness of the whole system increases as another network's capacity redundancy increases. But there exists a certain range within which the increase of one network's capacity redundancy results in the robustness decline of the whole system. This counterintuitive feature appears under different coupling patterns such as assortative, disassortative, or random coupling. This result advances our understanding of the robustness of interconnected networks.}}

One of the most important tasks of network analysis is to detect structures (also called structural regularities) embedded in networks by determining group number and group partition. Most of network structure exploration models only consider network links. However, in real world networks, nodes may have attributes that are useful for network structure exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) model to explore structural regularities in networks with node attributes, called Bayesian nonparametric attribute (BNPA) model. This model does not only take full advantage of both links between nodes and node attributes for group partition via shared hidden variables, but also determine group number automatically via the Bayesian nonparametric theory. Experiments conducted on a number of real and synthetic networks show that our BNPA model is able to automatically explore structural regularities in networks with node attributes and is competitive with other state-of-the-art models.}}

By using three real social network datasets, we find that increasing the judgment ability of individuals could curb the diffusion of rumor effectively. Under the same level of punishment cost, there are more spreaders in the network that has larger average degree. Moreover, the punishment fraction has more significant impact than the risk coefficient on the controlling of rumor diffusion. There exist some optimal risk coefficients and punishment fractions that could help more people refusing to spread rumor. In addition, the effect of the tie strength on the final fraction of spreaders is investigated. The results indicate that the rumor can be suppressed soon if the individuals preferentially select the neighbor either weaker or stronger ties persistently to update their strategy. However, choosing neighbor blindly may promote the spread of rumor. Finally, by comparing three kinds of punishment mechanisms, we show that taking the lead in punishing the higher degree nodes is the most effective measure to reduce the coverage of rumor.}}

Our results provide additional evidence that a dynamical study adds to the information gained by traditional topological analysis, providing a richer view of complex weighted networks. For example, while initial topological measures showed that the rail network is almost fully connected, dynamical measures highlighted hub nodes that experience disproportionately large traffic. The dynamical assortativity of the bus networks also differed from its topological counterpart. In addition, inspection of the weighted eigenvector centralities highlighted a significant difference in traffic flows for both networks during weekdays and weekends, suggesting the importance of adding a temporal perspective missing from many previous studies.}}

Based on the two-mode affiliation network theory, a new frontier of complex networks, we constructed two different networks, one taking the articles as nodes, the co-keyword relationships as edges and the quantity of co-keywords as the weight to construct articles co-keyword network, and another taking the articles' keywords as nodes, the co-occurrence relationships as edges and the quantity of simultaneous co-occurrences as the weight to construct keyword co-occurrence network. An integrated method for analyzing the topological features and evolution of the articles co-keyword network and keywords co-occurrence networks is proposed, and we also defined a new function to measure the innovation coefficient of the articles in annual level.

First, one can collect the proposed bio-markers in literature as being the preliminary candidate; Second, a spanning-tree based threshold can be used to reconstruct gene networks for normal and cancer samples; Third, by jointly using of degree changes and distribution of the candidates in communities, one can filter out the low-confident genes. The survival candidates are high-confident genes. Specially, we consider expression profiles for carcinoma of colon. A total of 34 preliminary bio-markers collected from literature are evaluated and a set of 16 genes are proposed as high confident bio-markers, which behave high performance in distinguishing normal and cancer samples.}}

Two-level modeling shows that firms' networking benefits both process and product innovation. Institutional support does not significantly affect quantity of networking, but greatly enhances quality of networking in the sense that support for networking in a country enhances the benefits of networking for both process and product innovation. Contrasting low and high support for networking leads to estimating that institutional support for networking can increase the benefits of networking considerably for both process and product innovation.}}

In response to this the bulk water network was significantly enhanced resulting in large infrastructure augmentations consisting of cross regional pipelines, a desalination plant and a purified recycled water plant. Given that SEQ can transition from drought to flood and vice versa in a short period of time it is a fine balance to operate the new more complicated asset base economically whilst maintaining sufficient supply security. With rising energy prices and the increasing cost of living pressures, there is an immediate need to better understand what optimal grid operation looks like and this is currently being investigated by the Seqwater Decision Support System (DSS). Till now, a network such as the SEQ water grid with its variety of water supply sources of varying reliabilities and complexity of the network has been operated in a relatively manual manner using manual heuristics. Given the number of factors which need to be considered when making decisions about which parts of the network to activate at any one time and the limitations of the human mind to resolve these, means that sub optimal results are frequently generated. The development of a DSS using optimization techniques can help determine the most efficient mode of delivery of water taking into account the operating costs of the various assets within the network, amongst a range of other constraints. This paper goes into detail the application of the optimization technology to the SEQ Water grid.}}

It has been conceived to be applied to the problem of getting information about people who disappeared in the Argentine state of Tucumán from 1974 to 1981. Even if the military dictatorship formally started in Argentina had begun in 1976 and lasted until 1983, the disappearance and assassination of people began some months earlier. During this period several circuits of Illegal Detention Centres (IDC) were set up in different locations all over the country. In these secret centres, disappeared people were illegally kept without any sort of constitutional guarantees, and later assassinated. Even today, the final destination of most of the disappeared people's remains is still unknown. The fundamental hypothesis in this work is that a group of people with the same political affiliation whose disappearances were closely related in time and space shared the same place of captivity (the same IDC or circuit of IDCs). This hypothesis makes sense when applied to the systematic method of repression and disappearances which was actually launched in Tucumán, Argentina (2007) [11]. In this work, the missing individuals are identified as nodes on a network and connections are established among them based on the individuals' attributes while they were alive, by using rules to link them. In order to determine which rules are the most effective in defining the network, we use other kind of knowledge available in this problem: previous results from the anthropological point of view (based on other sources of information, both oral and written, historical and anthropological data, etc.); and information about the place (one or more IDCs) where some people were kept during their captivity. For these best rules, a prediction about these people's possible destination is assigned (one or more IDCs where they could have been kept), and the success of the prediction is evaluated. By applying this methodology, we have been successful in 71% of the cases. The best rules take into account the proximity of the locations where the kidnappings took place, and link events which occurred in periods of time from 5 to 7 days. Finally, we used one of the best rules to build a network of IDCs in an attempt to formalize the relation between the illegal detention centres. We found that this network makes sense because there are survivors' testimonies which confirm some of these connections.}}

Understanding the composition of such networks requires an intricate decomposition of the network into modules, taking into account the manner in which network links are distributed among the nodes. There exists for each set of highly interlinked nodes little connectivity with the next set of highly interlinked nodes. This inherent property of nodes makes community detection a popular approach for analyzing the structure of complex networks. In this study, we attempt to understand the structure of the intraurban bus network of Ireland's capital city, Dublin in a two-step approach. We first analyze the modular structure of the network by identifying potential communities. Secondly, we assess the prominence of each network node by examining the module-based topological properties of the nodes. Results of this empirical study reveal a clear pattern of independent communities, indicating thus, an implicit multi-community structure of the intraurban bus network. Examination of the geographic characteristics of the identified communities shows a degree of socio-economic divisions of the Dublin city. Furthermore, a large majority of the important nodes (vital transportation hubs) are located at the city center, implying that most of the bus lines in Dublin city tend to intersect the city's core.}}

The model is analyzed for the case of uncorrelated semi-directed networks, and the basic reproduction number R 0 is obtained analytically. We verify that the R 0 contains the outbreak threshold on undirected networks and directed networks as special cases. It is proved that if R 0 &lt; 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, otherwise the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and the unique endemic equilibrium exists, which is globally asymptotically stable. Finally the numerical simulations holds for these analytical results are given.}}

We evaluate whether these strains differ in their thymic gene expression, allowing identification of genes that might play a role in susceptibility/resistance to CIA. Microarray profiling showed that 1093 PTA genes were differentially modulated between collagen immunized DBA-1/J and DBA-2/J mice. These genes were assigned to 17 different tissues/organs, including joints/bone, characterizing the promiscuous gene expression (PGE), which is implicated in self-representation. Hierarchical clustering of microarray data and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that Aire (autoimmune regulator), an important regulator of the PGE process, Aire-dependent (insulin), Aire-independent (Col2A1 and Gad67), and other 22 joint/bone autoantigen genes were down-regulated in DBA-1/J compared with DBA-2/J in the thymus. Considering the importance of MHC-H2 in peptide-self presentation and autoimmunity susceptibility, we reconstructed transcriptional networks of both strains based on actual microarray data. The networks clearly demonstrated different MHC-H2 transcriptional interactions with PTAs genes. DBA-1/J strain featured MHC-H2 as a node influencing downstream genes. Differently, in DBA-2/J strain network MHC-H2 was exclusively self-regulated and does not control other genes. These findings provide evidence that CIA susceptibility in mice may be a reflex of a cascade-like transcriptional control connecting different genes to MHC-H2 in the thymus.}}

In this article, we introduce a possible failure pattern of geographical networks–"regional failure"–by which nodes and edges within a region malfunction. Based on a previous spatial network model (Louf et al., 2013), we study the robustness of geographical networks against regional failure, which is measured by the fraction of nodes that remain in the largest connected component, via simulations. A small-area failure results in a large reduction of their robustness measure. Furthermore, we investigate two pre-deployed mechanisms to enhance their robustness: One is to extend the cost–benefit growth mechanism of the original network model by adding more than one link in a growth step, and the other is to strengthen the interconnection of hubs in generated networks. We measure the robustness-enhancing effects of both mechanisms on the basis of their costs, i.e., the amount of excessive links and the induced geographical length. The latter mechanism is better than the former one if a normal level of costs is considered. When costs exceed a certain level, the former has an advantage. Because the costs of excessive links affect the investment decision of real-world infrastructure networks, it is practical to enhance their robustness by adding more links between hubs. These results might help design robust geographical networks economically.}}

Conventional literatures analyze the network reliability assuming that the failure rates of all components in networks following the same membership function. However, most real-world networks do not abide by this regulation, especial complex ones. Therefore, in this paper, a new method is developed based on cellular automata (CA) and fuzzy logic following different types of fuzzy failure rates. The proposed method has two separate processing procedures: the computing of fuzzy numbers (CFN) and the decomposing model based on cellular automata (DB-CA). The combination of these procedures can be used to topology decomposition and the fuzzy reliability evaluation of any real network. Finally, The proposed method is improved by numerical network examples with a variety of membership functions, and the benchmark water delivery network in Shelby county is provided to estimate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model.}}

Then, by constructing a Lyapunov functional and using Jensen's inequality, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure the exponential stability of the resulting delayed differential equation. Based on that, the desired sampled-data feedback controllers are designed in terms of the solution to certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that can be solved effectively by using available software.

Preferential attachment is one of many algorithms that have been introduced to model the growth and structure of scale-free networks. With so many different models of scale-free networks it is unclear what properties of scale-free networks are typical, and what properties are peculiarities of a particular growth or construction process. We propose a simple maximum entropy process which provides the best representation of what are typical properties of scale-free networks, and provides a standard against which real and algorithmically generated networks can be compared. As an example we consider preferential attachment and find that this particular growth model does not yield typical realizations of scale-free networks. In particular, the widely discussed "fragility" of scale-free networks is actually found to be due to the peculiar "hub-centric" structure of preferential attachment networks. We provide a method to generate or remove this latent hub-centric bias—thereby demonstrating exactly which features of preferential attachment networks are atypical of the broader class of scale-free networks. We are also able to statistically demonstrate whether real networks are typical realizations of scale-free networks, or networks with that particular degree distribution; using a new surrogate generation method for complex networks, exactly analogous the widely used surrogate tests of nonlinear time series analysis.}}

Through topological principles, this paper investigates the controllability features of an ensemble of 58 U.S. city-level power transmission networks in seven U.S. states. To perform structural controllability analyses, the topological characteristics of the ensemble of networks are first quantified, including degree, shortest path length, clustering coefficient, meshedness and betweenness centrality, as well as the uncertainty associated with these and related properties. Then, the paper focuses on the controllability features of complex networks so as to detect the minimal sets of driver nodes to possibly control the networks given system linearity assumptions. Accordingly, a node is critical, intermittent or redundant if it acts as a driver node in all, some, or none of the potentially controllable system configurations. Moreover, this paper constructs a new methodology to quantify the probability of being a driver node among the intermittent nodes, and reveals the controllability importance of system components. Results show that a small proportion of driver nodes can provide the conditions for controlling the slow dynamics of entire power transmission networks from a topological perspective, despite variations in network sizes and configurations. This paper also reveals that the driver nodes tend to avoid high degree nodes and high triangulation sub-graph nodes as well as high betweenness centrality nodes. The identification of topological differences for different categories of nodes (critical, intermittent or redundant) could help researchers and utilities understand the conditions for future functional controllability of power networks while improving their reliability and resilience as well as facilitating their transition into smart grid systems.}}

In order to automate the extraction, processing and exporting of data, a software program was developed allowing to extract the needed data from General Transit Feed Specification, thus overcoming difficulties occurring in accessing and collecting data. The proposed method was applied to a real-life PTN in Auckland, New Zealand, with the purpose of examining whether it showed characteristics of scale-free networks and exhibited features of "small-world" networks. As a result, new regression equations were derived analytically describing observed, strong, non-linear relationships among the probabilities of randomly chosen stops in the PTN to be serviced by a given number of routes. The established dependence is best fitted by an exponential rather than a power-law function, showing that the PTN examined is neither random nor scale-free, but a mixture of the two. This finding explains the presence of hubs that are not typical of exponential networks and simultaneously not highly connected to the other nodes as is the case with scale-free networks. On the other hand, the observed values of the topological properties of the network show that although it is highly clustered, owing to its representation as a directed graph, it differs slightly from "small-world" networks, which are characterized by strong clustering and a short average path length.}}

The community of complexity science is devoting significant efforts to define laws, models, and theories, which, based on acquired knowledge, are able to predict future observations (e.g. success of a product). In the mean time, the semantic web community aims at engineering a new generation of advanced services by defining constructs, models and methods, adding a semantic layer to SNs. In this context, a leapfrog is expected to come from a hybrid approach merging the disciplines above. Along this line, this work focuses on the propagation of individual interests in social networks. The proposed framework consists of the following main components: a method to gather information about the members of the social networks; methods to perform some semantic analysis of the Domain of Interest; a procedure to infer members' interests; and an interests evolution theory to predict how the interests propagate in the network. As a result, one achieves an analytic tool to measure individual features, such as members' susceptibilities and authorities. Although the approach applies to any type of social network, here it is has been tested against the computer science research community. The DBLP (Digital Bibliography and Library Project) database has been elected as test-case since it provides the most comprehensive list of scientific production in this field.}}

The chemical reactions can occur within the liquid phase, as well as between the liquid and solid phases which may result in an evolution of porosity and permeability. Under variably saturated conditions the area of interfaces changes with degree of the fluid saturation. PoreFlow uses complex formulations for more accurate modeling of transport problems in presence of the nonwetting phase. This is done by refining the discretization within drained pores. An implicit numerical scheme is used to solve the governing equations, and an efficient substitution method is applied to considerably minimize computational times. Several examples are provided, under saturated and variably saturated conditions, to demonstrate the model applicability in hydrogeology problems and petroleum fields. We show that PoreFlow is a powerful tool for upscaling of flow and transport in porous media, utilizing different pore scale information such as various interfaces, phase distributions and local fluxes and concentrations to determine macro scale properties such as average saturation, relative permeability, solute dispersivity, adsorption coefficients, effective diffusion and tortuosity. Such information can be used as constitutive relations within continuum scale governing equations to model physical and chemical processes more accurately at the larger scales.}}

Collective behavior of agents interacting over complex networks is important in many applications. The cooperation between selfish individuals is one of the most interesting collective phenomena. In this paper we address the interplay between the motifs' cooperation properties and their abundance in a number of real-world networks including yeast protein–protein interaction, human brain, protein structure, email communication, dolphins' social interaction, Zachary karate club and Net-science coauthorship networks. First, the amount of cooperativity for all possible undirected subgraphs with three to six nodes is calculated. To this end, the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma game is considered and the cooperativity of each subgraph is calculated as the percentage of cooperating agents at the end of the simulation time. Then, the three- to six-node motifs are extracted for each network. The significance of the abundance of a motif, represented by a Z -value, is obtained by comparing them with some properly randomized versions of the original network. We found that there is always a group of motifs showing a significant inverse correlation between their cooperativity amount and Z -value, i.e. the more the Z -value the less the amount of cooperativity. This suggests that networks composed of well-structured units do not have good cooperativity properties.}}

The use of the local information in the proposed algorithm directly leads to the reduction of complexity. The algorithm runs in O ( n + m ) time for a general network and O ( n ) for a sparse network, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in a network. The algorithm fast produces the desired results when applied to search for communities in a benchmark and five classical real-world networks, which are widely used to test algorithms of community detection in the complex network. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, neither global modularity nor local modularity is utilized in the proposal.

While the fluorescence emitted by the antenna pigments of this complex is known as an important indicator of the activity of photosynthesis, its interpretation was difficult because of the complexity of PS II. In this study, an extensive kinetic model which describes the complex and multi-timescale characteristics of PS II is analyzed through the use of the hierarchical coarse-graining method proposed in the authors׳ earlier work. In this coarse-grained analysis, the reaction center (RC) is described by two states, open and closed RCs, both of which consist of oxidized and neutral special pairs being in quasi-equilibrium states. Besides, the PS II model at millisecond scale with three-state RC, which was studied previously, could be derived by suitably adjusting the kinetic parameters of electron transfer between tyrosine and RC. Our novel coarse-grained model of PS II can appropriately explain the light-intensity dependent change of the characteristic patterns of fluorescence induction kinetics from O-J-I-P, which shows two inflection points, J and I, between initial point O and peak point P, to O-J-D-I-P, which shows a dip D between J and I inflection points.}}

In the QAP weighted network, a node depicts a relation and an undirect edge exists between any pair of nodes if there is significant correlation between relations. As an application of the QAP weighted network, we study international services trade by using the QAP weighted network, in which nodes depict 10 kinds of services trade relations. After the analysis of international services trade by QAP weighted network, and by using distance indicators, hierarchy tree and minimum spanning tree, the conclusion shows that: Firstly, significant correlation exists in all services trade, and the development of any one service trade will stimulate the other nine. Secondly, as the economic globalization goes deeper, correlations in all services trade have been strengthened continually, and clustering effects exist in those services trade. Thirdly, transportation services trade, computer and information services trade and communication services trade have the most influence and are at the core in all services trade.}}

Electroencephalography (EEG) activities were recorded in 10 MCI patients and 17 healthy subjects when they performed a color match task. We calculated the phase synchrony index between each possible pairs of EEG channels in alpha and beta frequency bands and analyzed the local interconnectedness, overall connectedness and small-world characteristic of brain network in different degree for two groups. Relative to healthy normal controls, the properties of cortical networks in MCI patients tend to be a shift of randomization. Lower σ of MCI had suggested that patients had a further loss of small-world attribute both during active and resting states. Our results provide evidence for the functional disconnection of brain regions in MCI. Furthermore, we found the properties of cortical networks could reflect the processing of conflict information in the selective attention task. The human brain tends to be a more regular and efficient neural architecture in the late stage of information processing. In addition, the processing of conflict information needs stronger information integration and transfer between cortical areas.}}

The complex modulus of base and EVA polymer modified bitumen (PMB) samples were determined using dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). PMB samples have been produced by mixing a 50/70 penetration grade base bitumen with EVA copolymer at five different polymer contents. In ANFIS modeling, the bitumen temperature, frequency and EVA content are the parameters for the input layer and the complex modulus is the parameter for the output layer. The hybrid learning algorithm related to the ANFIS has been used in this study. The variants of the algorithm used in the study are two input membership functions and three input membership functions for each of the all inputs. The input membership functions are triangular, gbell, gauss2, and gauss. The results showed that EVA polymer modified bitumens display reduced temperature susceptibility than base bitumens. In the light of analysis the Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System and statistical methods can be used for modeling the complex modulus of bitumen under varying temperature and frequency. The analysis indicated that the training accuracy is improved by decreasing the number of input membership functions and the utilization of the two gauss input membership functions appeared to be most optimal topology. Besides, it is realized that the predicted complex modulus is closely related with the measured (actual) complex modulus.}}

Here we focus on recent research on the dynamics of the multiple communication pathways between clock neurons, and, particularly, on how the circadian timekeeping system responds to changes in environmental conditions. It is increasingly clear that the fly clock employs multiple signalling cues, such as neuropeptides, fast neurotransmitters, and other signalling molecules, in the dynamic interplay between neuronal clusters. These neuronal groups seem to interact in a plastic fashion, e.g., rearranging their hierarchy in response to changing environmental conditions. A picture is emerging supporting that these dynamic mechanisms are in place to provide an optimal balance between flexibility and an extraordinary accuracy.}}

However, these homogeneous networks do not adequately describe the heterogeneity of incubating firms in different types of business incubators. To solve the problem of heterogeneity, the notion of a knowledge supernetwork has been used both to construct a knowledge interaction model among incubating firms and to distinguish social network relationships from knowledge network relationships. The process of knowledge interaction and network evolution can then be simulated with a few rules for incubating firms regarding knowledge innovation/absorption, social network connection, and entry and exit, among other aspects. Knowledge and networks have been used as performance indicators to evaluate the evolution of knowledge supernetworks. Moreover, we study the robustness of incubating firms' social networks by employing four types of attack strategies. Based on our simulation results, we conclude that there have been significant knowledge interaction and network evolution among incubating firms on a periodic basis and that both specialized and diversified business incubators have every advantage necessary in terms of both knowledge and networks to cultivate start-up companies. As far as network robustness is concerned, there is no obvious difference between the two types of business incubators with respect to the stability of their network structures, but specialized business incubators have stronger network communication abilities than diversified business incubators.}}

Computational advances have emerged in recent years that provide opportunities for simulating the influence that agency structure has on policy outcomes, particularly those stemming from the area of network theory and analysis. However, there remains a need for methods that can measure and visualize the confounding effects that multiple agency characteristics may impose on policy implementation. The complex interactions among these factors require an approach that can evaluate these factors in relation to one another and provide a way to abstract meaningful findings that can be useful for both scientists and agencies to consider for future policy development. In this study, we present a network simulation modeling approach that (1) builds upon existing conceptualizations of bureaucrat decision-making within agency networks, (2) uses network theory to construct idealized natural resource agency networks that can be used to evaluate how agency structure influences policy implementation, and (3) visualizes simulation results to better understand how bureaucrat behaviors and relationships in concert with agency structure influence policy outcomes. Using this approach, we demonstrate how different aspects of decision-making by bureaucrats interact with the spatial constraints of institutional networks to influence policy outcomes. The network modeling and visualization methods presented here offer an alternative approach in the policy science toolbox that can help generate new assumptions and questions about the ways in which natural resources are governed.}}

abstract = {Abstract This paper addresses the problem of bearing-based network localization, which aims to localize all the nodes in a static network given the locations of a subset of nodes termed anchors and inter-node bearings measured in a common reference frame. The contributions of the paper are twofold. Firstly, we propose necessary and sufficient conditions for network localizability with both algebraic and rigidity theoretic interpretations. Secondly, we propose and analyze a linear distributed protocol for bearing-based network localization. One novelty of our work is that the localizability analysis and localization protocol are applicable to networks in arbitrary dimensional spaces.}}

abstract = {Abstract The high strain-rate rheological and mechanical properties of bi-modal epoxy polymer networks were characterized using molecular dynamics simulation. The complex Young's modulus was found by applying a cyclic sinusoidal strain over a wide range of temperatures spanning the glass transition. The non-linear stress response was studied in the glass transition region using uni-axial deformation. We discuss special considerations in computing viscoelastic properties at the high strain-rates available to molecular dynamics. As in experimental studies, the complex modulus is shown to be a function of the network composition and strain rate. However, the high strain-rate simulations performed here predict the existence of broad peaks in the temperature-dependent loss modulus and slow relaxation of the storage modulus. In general, it is observed that network compositions with larger amounts of short, stiff 4,4'-methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (MCA) cross-linkers lead to an increase in the mechanical glass transition temperature as well as the breadth of the glass transition compared to longer, more flexible poly(oxypropylene) diamine (POP) cross-linkers. When the networks of any composition were deformed beyond the linear region, the stress response displayed a plateau that was associated with the extension of network chains.}}

The finite field, which is a kind of finite alphabet, is considered due to the fact that networks often possess limited computation, memory, and capabilities of communication. First, by graph-theoretic method, one necessary and sufficient condition is derived for finite-field consensus of switching networks without time-delays. Subsequently, another necessary and sufficient condition on finite-field consensus without time-delays is provided based on FFC property of matrices associated with switching networks. Moreover, by means of the results on delay-free networks, some necessary and sufficient conditions for finite-field consensus of networks with both switching topology and time-delays are obtained. Additionally, it can be shown that switching networks with time-delays present in each self-transmission cannot achieve consensus.}}

A completely new approach of power equipment modeling – modeling based on Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNN) – gives an opportunity to build a high-quality models which are able to track dynamics of grid devices. The nature of the approach makes it relatively easy to build models of all electric network devices even individually taking into account the uniqueness of each one.

DACCER computes centrality based only on localized information restricted to a limited neighborhood around each node, thus not requiring full knowledge of the network topology. We indicate that the node centrality ranking computed by DACCER is highly correlated with the node ranking based on the traditional closeness centrality, which requires high computational costs and full knowledge of the network topology by the entity responsible for calculating the centrality. This outcome is quite useful given the vast potential applicability of closeness centrality, which is seldom applied to large-scale networks due to its high computational costs. Results indicate that DACCER is simple, yet efficient, in assessing node centrality while allowing a distributed implementation that contributes to its performance. This also contributes to the practical applicability of DACCER to the analysis of large complex networks, as indicated in our experimental evaluation using both synthetically generated networks and real-world network traces of different kinds and scales.}}

The research revealed that the PMIS software application, by itself, would have had limited impact, and similarly the practitioner–researchers who developed and implemented the PMIS would, by themselves, have been less effective. Instead, the contribution, effectiveness and capability came from the stable network of association between the practitioner–researchers and the PMIS; an actor–network, which allowed other networks to stabilise and develop, as new users learned how to conceptualise their work through project management concepts, and developed their project management capability.}}

We make two main contributions to the study of FiWi networking with a long-range PON with a propagation distance on the order of 100 km in this paper. First, through extensive simulations, we investigate the packet delays when relatively low-rate traffic that has traversed a wireless network is mixed with conventional high-rate PON-only traffic. We consider a range of different FiWi network architectures with different dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) mechanisms. Second, we closely examine the grouping of the optical network units (ONUs) in the double-phase polling (DPP) DBA mechanism in long-range FiWi networks. We introduce a novel grouping by cycle length (GCL) strategy that achieves favorable packet delay performance.}}

The results of this paper are applicable to both directed and undirected weighted networks while do not need to know any information about eigenvalues of coupling matrix.

Also shown is that the node-to-node mapping between source and target texts (English–Portuguese and Spanish–Portuguese pairs) can be improved by adding further hierarchical levels for the metrics out-degree, in-degree, hierarchical common degree, cluster coefficient, inter-ring degree, intra-ring degree and convergence ratio. The results presented here amount to a proof-of-principle that the possible capturing of a wider context with the hierarchical levels may be combined with machine learning methods to yield an approach for assessing the quality of MT systems.}}

We calculate the basic reproductive number R0 and analyze the relevant stability of the equilibria (disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium) of the model by applying limiting system theory and comparison principle. The results reveal that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable given R 0 &lt; 1 , whereas the condition R 0 &gt; 1 leads to a globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium. Our numerical simulations show that demographic factors, such as birth, immigration, and short-time travels, play important roles in epidemic propagation from one community to another. Moreover, we quantitatively demonstrate how the distribution of individual׳s network degree would affect the result of disease transmission.}}

This work presents procedures to generate networks with specified structural properties which rely on the solution of classes of integer optimization problems. We show that, for many of them, the constraints matrices are totally unimodular, allowing the efficient generation of conditional random networks by specialized interior-point methods. The computational results suggest that the proposed methods can represent a general framework for the efficient generation of random networks even beyond the models analyzed in this paper. This work also opens the possibility for other applications of mathematical programming in the analysis of complex networks.}}

The morphological evolutions of such networks have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Growth behavior of 3-D networks under different experimental conditions has been discussed. These ZnO-T networks were alloyed with different metals (Al, Cu, Sn, etc.) and accordingly characterized in detail for various properties. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the crystal structure of such 3-D ZnO interconnected networks. The porosity of these interconnected 3D networks was tuned by controlling the initial tetrapods concentrations and M-alloying level, thus metal doped highly porous networks (up to 98%) have been synthesized. Electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of these networks were measured, as well as the correlation between porosity and alloying has been established. The properties of the pure and M-alloyed ZnO-T based flexible 3-D ceramic networks could be suitable for diverse utilizations in synthesizing new varieties of nano- and micro-scale 3-D materials and multifunctional practical applications.}}

The process mimics the tendency of authors to cite varying numbers of papers included in the bibliographies of the other papers they cite. We show that the degree distributions of the networks generated after a large number of iterations are scale-free and derive an expression for the power-law exponent. In a particular case of the model where the number of ambassadors is always the constant m and the number of selected descendants from each ambassador is the constant l , the power-law exponent is ( 2 l + 1 ) / l . For this example we derive expressions for the degree distribution and clustering coefficient in terms of l and m . We conclude that the proposed model can be tuned to have the same power law exponent and clustering coefficient of a broad range of the scale-free distributions that have been studied empirically.}}

abstract = {Abstract Neural network has been applied in several classification problems such as in medical diagnosis, handwriting recognition, and product inspection, with a good classification performance. The performance of a neural network is characterized by the neural network's structure, transfer function, and learning algorithm. However, a neural network classifier tends to be weak if it uses an inappropriate structure. The neural network's structure depends on the complexity of the relationship between the input and the output. There are no exact rules that can be used to determine the neural network's structure. Therefore, studies in improving neural network classification performance without changing the neural network's structure is a challenging issue. This paper proposes a method to improve neural network classification performance by constructing a linear model based on the Kalman filter as a post processing. The linear model transforms the predicted output of the neural network to a value close to the desired output by using the linear combination of the object features and the predicted output. This simple transformation will reduce the error of neural network and improve classification performance. The Kalman filter iteration is used to estimate the parameters of the linear model. Five datasets from various domains with various characteristics, such as attribute types, the number of attributes, the number of samples, and the number of classes, were used for empirical validation. The validation results show that the linear model based on the Kalman filter can improve the performance of the original neural network.}}

The present study aimed to find evidence in the literature that malware has already adapted, to a significant degree, to this specific form of Big Data. Evidence of the potential for abuse of personal information was found: predictive models for personal traits of Facebook users are alarmingly effective with only a minimal depth of information, "Likes", It is likely that more complex forms of information (e.g. posts, photos, connections, statuses) could lead to an unprecedented level of intrusiveness and familiarity with sensitive personal information. Support for the view that this potential for abuse of private information is being exploited was found in research describing the rapid adaptation of malware to social networking sites, for the purposes of social engineering and involuntary surrendering of personal information.}}

abstract = {Recently Estrada and Hatano proposed an algorithm for the detection of community structure in complex networks using the concept of network communicability. Here we amend this algorithm by eliminating the subjectivity of choosing degree of overlapping and including an additional check of the fitness of detected communities. We show that this amendment can detect some communities which remain undetected by Estrada and Hatano's algorithm. For instance, let G(p, q) be a graph obtained from two cliques, Kp and Kq(p ⩾ q ⩾ 3), joined by a single edge. It is apparent that this graph contains two communities, namely the two cliques. However, Estrada and Hatano's algorithm detects only Kq as a community when p is sufficiently larger than q. Our algorithm correctly detects both communities. Also, our method also finds the correct community structure in one of the classic benchmark networks, the Zachary karate club.}}

The bottom-up approach of building well-defined neural networks with controlled topology has immense promise for improved reproducibility and increased target selectivity and response of drug action, along with hopes to unravel the relationships between functional connectivity and its imprinted physiological and pathological functions. In this review, we summarize the different approaches available for engineering neural networks treated analogously to a mathematical graph consisting of cell bodies and axons as nodes and edges, respectively. After discussing the advances and limitations of the current techniques in terms of cell placement to the nodes and guiding the growth of axons to connect them, the basic properties of patterned networks are analyzed in respect to cell survival and activity dynamics, and compared to that of in vivo and random in vitro cultures. Besides the fundamental scientific interest and relevance to drug and toxicology tests, we also visualize the possible applications of such engineered networks. The review concludes by comparing the possibilities and limitations of the different methods for realizing in vitro engineered neural networks in 2D.}}

abstract = {Abstract Research involving artificial neural networks has tended to be driven towards efficient computation, especially in the domain of pattern recognition, or towards elucidating biological processes in the brain. Models have become more detailed as our understanding of the biology of the brain has increased, incorporating real-time behaviour of individual neurons interacting within complex system structures and dynamics. There are few examples of abstract and fully formal models of biologically plausible neural networks: in the neural networks literature models are often presented as a mixture of mathematical equations and natural language, supported by simulation code and associated experimental results. The informality often hides or obscures important aspects of a particular model, and leaves a large conceptual gap between the model descriptions and the usually low-level programming code used to simulate them. The main contribution of this paper is formally modelling and analysing a biologically plausible neural network model from the literature that exhibits complex neuron-level behaviour and network-level structure. To achieve this a modelling language ‘Pann' is developed, based on the process algebras CSP and Hybridχ. It is designed to be convenient for mixing the behaviour of discrete events (such as a neuron spike) with mutable continuous and discrete variables (representing chemical properties of a neuron, for instance). Its behaviour is defined using an operational semantics, from which a set of general properties of the language is proved. The groundwork for the biological model is laid by first formalising some well-known concepts from the artificial neural networks domain, such as feedforward behaviour, backpropagation, and recurrent neural networks. The Pann model of a feedforward network, comprising a set of communicating processes representing individual neurons, is proved equivalent to the standard one-line calculation of feedforward behaviour.}}

However, mounting evidence suggests that initially the network microenvironment of the adult central nervous system (CNS) is innately non-permissive to glioma cell invasion. The main players are inhibitory molecules in CNS myelin, as well as proteoglycans associated with astrocytes. Neural stem cells, and neurons themselves, possess inhibitory functions against neighboring tumor cells. These mechanisms have evolved to protect the established neuron-glia network, which is necessary for brain function. Greater insight into the interaction between glioma cells and the surrounding neuron-glia network is crucial for developing new therapies for treating these devastating tumors while preserving the important and complex neural functions of patients.}}

This approach has resulted in a number of important insights for the evolution of cooperation in the biological and social sciences, but omits a key function of social networks that has persisted throughout recent evolutionary history (Apicella et al., 2012): their role in transmitting gossip about behavior within a group. Accounting for this well-established role of social networks among rational agents in a setting of indirect reciprocity not only shows a new mechanism by which the structure of networks is fitness-relevant, but also reveals that knowledge of social networks can be fitness-relevant as well. When groups enforce cooperation by sanctioning peers whom gossip reveals to have deviated, individuals in certain peripheral network positions are tempting targets of uncooperative behavior because gossip they share about misbehavior spreads slowly through the network. The ability to identify these individuals creates incentives to behave uncooperatively. Consequently, groups comprised of individuals who knew precise information about their social networks would be at a fitness disadvantage relative to groups of individuals with a coarser knowledge of their networks. Empirical work has consistently shown that modern humans know little about the structure of their own social networks and perform poorly when tasked with learning new ones. This robust empirical regularity may be the product of natural selection in an environment of strong selective pressure at the group level. Imprecise views of networks make enforcing cooperation easier.}}

To do so, they must overcome three principal challenges: they need to build partnerships, integrate the partners' value contributions, and coordinate innovation processes. We followed three innovation networks over a three-year period and examined how they successfully used information systems (IS) to respond to these challenges. On the basis of their experiences we identify IS categories and measures that support setting up an information management for networked innovation.

By two complementary AuNPs modified single-stranded DNA, DNA–gold nanoparticles network was self-assembled. With the linkage of benzenedithiol bridge, the DNA network structure was immobilized on the surface of gold electrode through the covalent Au–S bond. In the presence of Dam MTase, the special sites of DNA–AuNPs network were methylated and could not be digested by restriction endonuclease Mbo I. Thus the loaded electrochemical indicator Methylene blue (MB) was MB molecules still remained on the DNA–Au NPs network. The electrochemical response depended on the methylated degree, which could be used to detect MTase activity. By the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), it was demonstrated that a linear relationship between the DPV response and logarithm of Dam concentration ranged from 0.075 to 30 U/mL, achieving a low detection limit of 0.02 U/mL. The use of benzenedithiol avoided the direct incubation of the solid electrode with the capture DNA probe under complex and harsh conditions. Therefore the immobilization of DNA–AuNPs network was easy to be carried out, which is favorable for the specially high stability and reproducibility of the electrochemical biosensor.}}

Here, we use recurrence-based methods to distinguish such pregnancies already in the second trimester, using the following cardiovascular time series: the variability of heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. We perform recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), in addition to a novel approach, ε-recurrence networks, applied to a phase space constructed by means of these time series. We examine all possible coupling structures in a phase space constructed with the above-mentioned biosignals. Several measures including recurrence rate, determinism, laminarity, trapping time, and longest diagonal and vertical lines for the recurrence quantification analysis and average path length, mean coreness, global clustering coefficient, assortativity, and scale local transitivity dimension for the network measures are considered as parameters for our analysis. With these quantities, we perform a quadratic discriminant analysis that allows us to classify healthy pregnancies and upcoming preeclamptic patients with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 45.8% in the case of RQA and 91.7% and 68% when using ε-recurrence networks, respectively.}}

Differences between flare and nonflare groups for presence or number of different species within a higher level group (richness) were examined by permutational multivariate analysis of variance and logistic regression. Results Overall 81 species (35 genera) were detected in VB1 and 73 (33) in VB2. Mean (SD) VB1 and VB2 species count per person was 2.6 (1.5) and 2.4 (1.5) for 86 flare cases and 2.8 (1.3) and 2.5 (1.5) for 127 nonflare cases, respectively. Overall the species composition did not significantly differ between flare and nonflare cases at any level (p=0.14 species, p=0.95 genus in VB1 and VB2, respectively) in multivariate analysis for richness. Univariate analysis, unadjusted as well as adjusted, confirmed a significantly greater prevalence of fungi (Candida and Saccharomyces) in the flare group (15.7%) compared to the nonflare group in VB2 (3.9%) (p=0.01). When adjusted for antibiotic use and menstrual phase, women who reported a flare remained more likely to have fungi present in VB2 specimens (OR 8.3, CI 1.7–39.4). Conclusions Among women with urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome the prevalence of fungi (Candida and Saccharomyces sp.) was significantly greater in those who reported a flare compared to those who did not.}}

In the present work, we suppose the damaged number of channels of at some branching level of a tree-like branching network, and then the network becomes asymmetric. The transport properties of fluid flow and heat transfer properties in the damaged network will significantly differ from those in an undamaged network. The equivalent thermal conductivity of the damaged network is derived in this work. We find that the damaged channel number and branching levels have significant effect on optimal diameter ratio and the optimal thermal conductivity. It is found that the larger number of damaged channels results in the lower optimal thermal conductivity and the higher optimal diameter ratio. While the higher damaged branching levels lead to the lower optimal diameter ratio and higher optimal thermal conductivity. It is also found that the length ratios of the channels and total number of branching levels have no effect on optimal diameter ratio and the optimal thermal conductivity of damaged network. The present results may provide the important theoretical base for research and design of thermal transport systems.}}

First, connectivity distribution of a spatial economic network does not follow the power law. Second, according to the network structure, nine economic sectors could be divided into two groups, and there is significant discrepancy of network structure between these two groups. Moreover, the influence of the geographic distance plays an important role on the structure of a spatial economic network, network parameters are changed with the influence of the geographic distance.

abstract = {A new codification method (named a modified binary tree codification method) is developed for coding drainage networks. To express the inner topological structure of a drainage basin, it is necessary to delineate and code digital drainage networks from digital elevation model datasets. In this study, the established software TOPAZ is used to delineate river reaches, and the new codification method is applied, which is based on the application of binary-tree structures and hierarchical zones. A coded drainage network can then be stored in a relational database management system to achieve efficient manipulation of data items for topological operations. The utility of the new codification method is demonstrated by an example applied to the Digital Yellow River Model. The drainage network of the Middle Yellow River in northern China has been coded and the hydrological and soil erosion processes of its sub-basin, the Chabagou River basin, are simulated. Because more details of the drainage network can be efficiently and effectively described, the new codification method can support complex hydrological models and extract more information from hydrological simulations than ever before.}}

Social-network-based communication is becoming a necessity for companies to stay competitive. However, using social networks to effectively promote electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) remains challenging. Managers in general are unfamiliar with the key factors that can encourage online social network members to engage in eWOM. This study used social capital and self-determination theories to identify three social capital factors and two individual factors on eWOM. A survey of 238 social network users was conducted to determine the relative influence of these five factors on eWOM among the users. The partial least square analysis results indicate that tie strength and innovativeness directly influence eWOM in virtual social networks. Trust, shared language, and voluntary self-disclosure do not exhibit a significant influence. Theoretical and practical implications of the five factors for promoting eWOM in social networks are drawn from these findings.}}

We have built a network of networks, in which networks are connected among themselves according to the connections observed in the cat cortical areas aiming to study how inputs drive the synchronous behaviour in this cat brain-like network. We show that without external perturbations it is possible to observe high level of bursting synchronisation between neurons within almost all areas, except for the auditory area. Bursting synchronisation appears between neurons in the auditory region when an external perturbation is applied in another cognitive area. This is a clear evidence that burst synchronisation and collective behaviour in the brain might be a process mediated by other brain areas under stimulation.}}

While the effects of environmental change on single taxonomic or physical–chemical variables have been relatively well researched in isolation, understanding how environmental change propagates through the ecological network remains a major challenge. Capitalizing on the long-term monitoring program of the German Long-Term Ecosystem Research Network site Lake Müggelsee (1979-ongoing), we identified three time periods (1979–1995; 1996–2005; 2006–2013) which differed significantly in phytoplankton biomass and relative plankton community composition. Using multivariate first order autoregressive (MAR1) modeling on 13 pelagic plankton groups and four abiotic variables, we quantified interaction networks and indicators of stability and centrality for each period. Our results suggested that the Müggelsee network was bottom-up regulated in all periods and that stability increased over time. Moreover, in all three networks, non-trophic and indirect interactions appeared to be as commonly present as trophic and direct interactions. Using network centrality measures of betweenness and closeness, we identified keystone plankton groups and groups particularly responsive to environmental change based on variation in centrality ranks over time. Given a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction network at hand, MAR1 model-derived stability and centrality measures may potentially be used as integrated ecological indicators to monitor changes in stability of lake ecosystems and to identify particularly vulnerable components of the network.}}

These experiences influenced adolescents' psychological wellbeing, mediated by their responses to threat and judgement and maintaining "safe sharing" with their network. Social network use was conceived as a gamble of balancing its potentially positive and negative impact in a culture in which social network use appears to be unavoidable. Conclusions The findings indicate the importance of routine assessment and formulation of social networking use in understanding adolescents' psychological distress.

The squared distance of a node i to the origin in this n -dimensional space ( l i i + ) , yields a topological centrality index, defined as C ∗ ( i ) = 1 / l i i + . In turn, the sum of reciprocals of individual node centralities, ∑ i 1 / C ∗ ( i ) = ∑ i l i i + , or the trace of L + , yields the well-known Kirchhoff index ( K ) , an overall structural descriptor for the network. To put into context this geometric definition of centrality, we provide alternative interpretations of the proposed indices that connect them to meaningful topological characteristics — first, as forced detour overheads and frequency of recurrences in random walks that has an interesting analogy to voltage distributions in the equivalent electrical network; and then as the average connectedness of i in all the bi-partitions of the graph. These interpretations respectively help establish the topological centrality ( C ∗ ( i ) ) of node i as a measure of its overall position as well as its overall connectedness in the network; thus reflecting the robustness of i to random multiple edge failures. Through empirical evaluations using synthetic and real world networks, we demonstrate how the topological centrality is better able to distinguish nodes in terms of their structural roles in the network and, along with Kirchhoff index, is appropriately sensitive to perturbations/re-wirings in the network.}}

We derive the exact analytic formulas of the average weighted trapping time (AWTT), the average of node-to-trap mean weighted first-passage time over the whole networks, in terms of the network size Ng, the number of copies s, the node-weight factor w and the edge-weight factor r. The obtained result displays that in the large network, the AWTT grows as a power-law function of the network size Ng with the exponent, represented by θ ( s , r , w ) = log s ( s r w 2 ) when srw2 ≠ 1. Especially when s r w 2 = 1 , AWTT grows with increasing order Ng as log Ng. This also means that the efficiency of the trapping process depend on three main parameters: the number of copies s &gt; 1, node-weight factor 0 &lt; w ≤ 1, and edge-weight factor 0 &lt; r ≤ 1. The smaller the value of srw2 is, the more efficient the trapping process is.}}

Unlike the case in wired networks, achieving high capacity, providing effective isolation, and customization of the network requires intelligent configuration of wireless resources due to the effects of interference. In this paper, we focus on how to configure the "over-the-air" part of virtual wireless networks to enable simultaneous use of radio resources that overlap geographically. A configuration framework is proposed based on an infrastructure cellular network that employs fractional frequency reuse (FFR) and Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) to combat interference. Multiple scenarios are examined that include various network sizes and base station distances. Five radio resources configuration cases are developed and investigated with each of these scenarios for a number of parameter settings (e.g., transmit power, MIMO degree). From the analysis of capacity data obtained from simulations, we observe some general trends in the aggregate spectral efficiency, and more importantly, a variety of tradeoffs between service providers (SPs) or virtual network operators. Based on these tradeoffs, we create configuration maps using which, a network resource manager can select specific network configurations (transmit power, MIMO, etc.) to meet the demand and capabilities of SPs and their subscribers.}}

Recent studies suggest that heterogeneous network structure between elements plays an important role in determining the threshold of infection rate at the onset of epidemics, a fundamental quantity governing the epidemic dynamics. We consider the general case in which the infection rate at each node depends on its population size, as shown in recent empirical observations. We first prove that a sufficient condition for the endemic threshold (i.e., its upper bound), previously derived based on a mean-field approximation of network structure, also holds true for arbitrary networks. We also derive an improved condition showing that networks with the rich-club property (i.e., high connectivity between nodes with a large number of links) are more prone to disease spreading. The dependency of infection rate on population size introduces a considerable difference between this upper bound and estimates based on mean-field approximations, even when degree–degree correlations are considered. We verify the theoretical results with numerical simulations.}}

In this study, we characterized the intrinsic functional networks of the resting New Zealand White rabbit brain using BOLD fMRI data. Group independent component analysis revealed seven networks similar to those previously found in humans, non-human primates and/or rodents including the hippocampus, default mode, cerebellum, thalamus, and visual, somatosensory, and parietal cortices. For the first time, the intrinsic functional networks of the resting rabbit brain have been elucidated demonstrating the rabbit's applicability as a translational animal model. Without the confounding effects of anesthetics or sedatives, future experiments may employ rabbits to understand changes in neural connectivity and brain functioning as a result of experimental manipulation (e.g., temporary or permanent network disruption, learning-related changes, and drug administration).}}

For virtual machines co-existed on a server, inter-VM network performance turns out to be worse than expected. Although many efforts have been dedicated to that issue on paravirtualized (PV) machines, HVMs (Hardware Virtual Machines) get less attention. However, co-resident HVMs are also suffering from low network I/O performance which troubles IaaS cloud infrastructure providers. Such problem is prominent as in the front-back network model several performance bottlenecks appear when inter-VM traffic is being handled. In this paper, we propose a novel approach and implement a prototype called "HV2M" to optimize inter-HVM network performance, which mainly address the throughput issues. HV2M takes advantages of the existing mechanisms for HVMs provided by Xen and is totally hardware independent. Unlike the existing idea, HV2M pushes data to the receivers without using shared memory buffer to transfer the pending network data. To evaluate our work, we test and compare network response time, network throughput and CPU utilization with other popular approaches such as SR-IOV. The result shows that the new communication model has great improvements in network delay and throughput with little pressure on Domain-0.}}

In ANN model, the bitumen temperature, frequency and SBS contents are the parameters for the input layer where as the complex modulus is the parameter for the output layer.

Therefore, planning of any individual system regardless of such interdependence will increase the total cost of the whole combined systems.

To be specific, the objectives of the proposed model are to minimize both investment cost and production cost of the combined system while taking into account the N−1 network security criterion. Moreover, the stochastic nature of wind power generation is addressed in the proposed model. Consequently, it leads to a mixed integer non-linear, multi-objective, stochastic programming problem. To solve this complex model, the Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to capture the optimal Pareto front, wherein the Primal–Dual Interior-Point (PDIP) method combined with the point-estimate method is adopted to evaluate the objective functions. In addition, decision makers can use a fuzzy decision making approach based on their preference to select the final optimal solution from the optimal Pareto front. The effectiveness of the proposed model and method are validated on a modified IEEE 24-bus electricity network integrated with a 15-node natural gas system as well as a real-world system of Hainan province.}}

Results Network measures showed increased local integration across all frequency bands between control and PD-CN; in contrast, decreased local integration occurred in PD-D when compared to PD-CN in the alpha1 frequency band. Differences found in PD-MCI mirrored PD-D. Correlations were found between network measures and assessments of global cognitive performance in PD.

Significance These patterns suggest specific ways that interaction between cortical areas becomes abnormal and contributes to PD symptoms at various stages. Graph theory analysis by EEG suggests that network alteration and breakdown are robust attributes of PD cortical dysfunction pathophysiology.}}

The complex network zeta function and the graph surface function have been used to characterize these networks and to define a dimension for complex networks. In this work we present three new results related to the complex network dimension. First, we show the relationship of the concept to Kolmogorov complexity. Second, we show how the definition of complex network dimension can be reformulated by defining the concept for a single node, and then defining the complex network dimension as the supremum over all nodes. This makes the concept work better for formally infinite graphs. Third, we study interesting parallels to zeta dimension, a notion originally from number theory which has found connections to theoretical computer science. These parallels lead to a deeper insight into the complex network dimension, e.g., the formulation in terms of the entropy and a theorem relating dimension to connectivity.}}

In this work, we design minimal sensor networks which satisfy the two important properties of observability (ability to detect an intrusion) and identifiability (ability to identify the point of intrusion). Based on the hydraulic analysis of the network, a bipartite graph is constructed between intrusion points and the corresponding nodes that can potentially be affected by the contaminant. The problem of sensor network design is converted to a minimum set cover problem on the bipartite graph, and is solved using a greedy heuristic algorithm. The proposed method is illustrated using a medium scale urban WDN.}}

The clustering coefficient (CC), structural holes (SH), degree centrality (DC), closeness centrality (CNC), and betweenness centrality (BC) of each country are jointly used to comprehensively measure the structural properties of collaboration networks. Panel data models are employed to explore the effect of the network properties on R&amp;D efficiency. Our results not only reconfirm that collaboration network structure influences scientific publications at the country level, but also show that the higher SH, DC, CNC, and BC correlate positively with the better future efficiency.}}

Using 1034 towns in Hubei Province in China as the case-study area, this paper constructs a Hubei Province inter-town network (HBTN) through the radiation model and spatial accessibility and subsequently analyzes the network structure at the macro, medium and micro levels. Corresponding practical policies are provided based on the findings. The results are highlighted below: (1) The HBTN exhibits scale-free and small-world mixing properties; (2) The modular structure of HBTN is apparent. Inter-module connections in the east, central, and west present star-shape, web-like, and loose characteristics, respectively; the corresponding strategies are coordinated development, long-term cooperation and transportation improvement; (3) Five roles of towns were identified in the HBTN. Linking provincial hubs is an effective solution for different modules to achieve powerful alliances. Jingmen, Xiangyang, and Yichang should transform their roles to connector hubs to improve integrative development. This study validated the applicability of the network analysis method to concrete city system planning.

The SEMK methodology constitutes a versatile tool for quantifying the contributions of competing reaction pathways to the overall feed conversion. Apart from kinetic descriptors, the SEMK model also comprises catalyst descriptors that allow quantifying the effect of the catalyst properties on the chemical kinetics and, hence, rational design toward novel and innovative catalysts. It is reviewed how a 10% increase in hydroisomerization yields could be achieved after having unequivocally identified the responsible elementary steps for feed losses through cracking. Moreover, 2 novel examples illustrate how, upon implementation of the SEMK model in an adequate reactor model, industrial reactor operation can be efficiently simulated and the rate-determining phenomena in the overall feed conversion can be determined.}}

Attention networks are essential components of cognitive function and are subject to impairment after anesthesia and surgery.

We used an Attention Network Task (ANT) to examine the efficiency of the alerting, orienting, and executive control attention networks in middle-aged women (40–60 years) undergoing gynecologic surgery. A matched group of medical inpatients were recruited as a control. Methods Fifty female patients undergoing gynecologic surgery (observation group) and 50 female medical inpatients (control group) participated in this study. Preoperatively patients were administered a mini-mental state examination as a screening method. The preoperative efficiencies of three attention networks in an attention network test were compared to the 1st and 5th post-operative days. Results The control group did not have any significant attention network impairments. On the 1st postoperative day, significant impairment was shown in the alerting (p = 0.003 vs. control group, p = 0.015 vs. baseline), orienting (p &lt; 0.001 vs. both baseline level and control group), and executive control networks (p = 0.007 vs. control group, p = 0.002 vs. baseline) of the observation group. By the 5th postoperative day, the alerting network efficiency had recovered to preoperative levels (p = 0.464 vs. baseline) and the orienting network efficiency had recovered partially (p = 0.031 vs. 1st post-operative day), but not to preoperative levels (p = 0.01 vs. baseline). The executive control network did not recover by the 5th postoperative day (p = 0.001 vs. baseline, p = 0.680 vs. 1st post-operative day). Conclusions Attention networks of middle-aged women show a varying degree of significant impairment and differing levels of recovery after surgery and propofol anesthetic.}}

However, it is often difficult to gather enough hardware resources for experimenting with a reasonably sized distributed application inside a controlled environment. Virtualization is thus a handy technique for creating such an experimentation testbed. We propose a tool called NEmu designed to create virtual dynamic networks by using emulation for testing and evaluating prototypes of networked or distributed applications with a complete control over the network topology and link parameters. NEmu leverages system emulators such as QEMU for virtualizing the hosts and the routers. It uses vnd for virtualizing components such as links and switches. In addition, NEmu allows users to create such customized topologies with limited hardware resources and without any administrative rights. We validate NEmu by replicating two network experiments and by showing that NEmu gives results very similar to the original ones.}}

Most SUD research aggregates across these symptoms to study the behavior of SUD as a static construct. We use an alternative approach that conceptualizes symptoms as directly interacting variables in psychopathological networks. We apply network models to symptom-level data to investigate the unique roles of individual symptoms and their interactions in SUD. Methods We analyzed 11 DSM III-R/IV abuse and dependence criteria in a sample of 2405 adult twins who reported use of at least one illicit substance six or more times from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders (VATSPSUD). We estimated a symptom network for each substance class as well as a global network collapsed across all substance classes. We examined similarities and differences across the 6 networks in terms of symptom-to-symptom connections and symptom centrality. Results The global network model revealed several interesting symptom connections, such as a strong predictive relation between tolerance and more-than-planned substance use. The most central symptom was using a drug more than planned. In addition, several interesting differences across substances emerged, both in the strength of symptom connections as well as the centrality of symptoms to each network. Conclusions When analyzed as networks, abuse and dependence symptoms do not function equivalently across illicit substance classes. These findings suggest the value of analyzing individual symptoms and their associations to gain new insight into the mechanisms of SUD.}}

In this paper, a novel similarity measurement is defined according to social balance theory for signed networks. Inter-community positive links are found and deleted due to their low similarity. The positive neighbor sets are reconstructed by this method. Then, differential equations are proposed to imitate the constantly changing states of nodes. Each node will update its state based on the difference between its state and average state of its positive neighbors. Nodes in the same community will evolve together with time and nodes in the different communities will evolve far away. Communities are detected ultimately when states of nodes are stable. Experiments on real world and synthetic networks are implemented to verify detection performance. The thorough comparisons demonstrate the presented method is more efficient than two acknowledged better algorithms.}}

Traditionally, elements are assigned a Cartesian coordinate location, and the allocation problem is solved in three-dimensional space. The coordinates for each subsequent element are selected by considering the element's interactions with placed and yet-to-be-placed elements. This paper presents a new approach to ship arrangements that starts with a non-spatial, network theory-based perspective and results in the traditional assignment of shipboard items to designated structural zones. Network partitioning is used to identify groups of mutually compatible ship elements, termed communities. A metric is introduced to express each community's cumulative preference to be located in specified regions of the ship. The cumulative preferences are used in a direct community-to-structural zone seeding procedure that creates reasonable initial compartment allocations. The rudimentary design knowledge required to position a particular set of shipboard elements using the proposed methods is ideally suited to early-stage design processes.}}

Two classes of MSCNs are considered. In order to analyze synchronization controllability for the two classes of MSCNs from synchronization control cost viewpoint, synchronization control cost and synchronization controllability are defined, respectively. By utilizing M-matrix properties, a novel Lyapunov function and the stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient criteria of mean square synchronization and global synchronization for the two classes of MSCNs under feedback control are derived. Three numerical examples and simulations are given to illustrate the following conclusions: (1) the two classes of MSCNs under the same linear negative feedback controller can achieve mean square exponential synchronization and global synchronization if they satisfy sufficient conditions of mean square exponential synchronization; (2) by computing synchronization control cost, we obtain that global synchronization controllability for the first class of MSCNs may perhaps stronger or poorer than that of the second class of MSCNs with time-varying delays.}}

Although there are several studies in this area, diagnosis and resolution of anomalies are still challenging issues. From an expert system point of view, current solutions have not been sufficient to meet the requirements demanded for use in large-scale network environments, and thus a significant portion of budgets on the workforce are spent to network management. Based on this context, the focus of this paper consists of the development of a system able to proactively monitor the network and detect anomalous events, reducing manual intervention and the probability of errors in decision-making, regarding network management. The proposed approach characterizes the normal pattern of the network traffic and detects anomalous behavior, outage events and attacks by deviations from this pattern. For this purpose, an unsupervised learning methodology is used to extract features of traffic through IP flows attributes, collected from a network structure. Aiming to improve its efficiency, a modification of the Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic is proposed, which through self-organized agents optimizes the analysis of multidimensional flows attributes and allows it to be completed in time to mitigate the impact on large-scale networks. In addition to notify the network manager about the anomalies, the system provides necessary information to identify and take action against them. The resulting detection system was tested with real and simulated data, achieving high detection rates while the false alarm rate remains low.}}

Mobile ad-hoc networks are mainly formed by mobile users, which can belong to different trust domains, in order to leverage the wealth of pervasive resources and available capabilities. The use of digital certificates is suitable for pervasive networking because of its decentralized and dynamic nature. Nevertheless, the validation of such certificates can become a more complex and costly process than it is in fixed-infrastructure networks. This is because pervasive networks face challenges such as environments that change with a certain degree of randomness, ad-hoc interactions with foreign devices, temporal disconnections that make it difficult to access updated and required information, and limited devices running costly processes. For these reasons, we propose a user-centric architecture that extends the validation of digital certificates in an adaptive way. The main contribution consists of a decision engine that takes advantage of the specific local and external resources in an opportunistic fashion. The solution preserves the security level required for each application and the resource consumption of the user device.}}

Nowadays, such a grouping is either based on network prefixes that does not meet the requirement mentioned above as difference of traffic behavior of individual IP address not being considered, or clustering IP hosts based on their traffic patterns, which requires information about TCP/UDP port numbers (which are occasionally obfuscated) or packet payloads (which are sometimes encrypted or unavailable from aggregated flow records). This paper proposes a new methodology of clustering IP addresses within a managed network domain such as campus network or ISP clients with similar social relationship based on inter-IP connectivity structure. The key idea of this methodology is to split the entire IP address space into Internal (inside the managed domain) and External (outside) ones. The clustering strategy is to group inside IP addresses that communicate with common outside IP addresses, the similarity measure of two inside IP addresses is the unique number of the common outside IP addresses. We propose a novel approach with an approximation algorithm to discover communities on a large scale in the managed domain based on the bipartite networks and one mode projection and the basis of graph partitioning of the similarity graph. Bipartite networks were built using NetFlow datasets collected from a boundary router in an actual environment, and then a one-mode projection has been applied to build a social relationship similarity graph of the inside IP addresses. We propose a community detection algorithm to extract communities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can discover communities from real large scale managed domain networks with a high quality. We experimentally validate our approach in terms of IP networking by applying deep flow inspection (DFI) and deep packet inspection (DPI) on related traffic to prove that hosts with the same cluster tend to have some dominant network behavior. We demonstrated the practical benefits of exploring social behavior similarity of IP hosts in understanding application usage, users' behavior, detecting malicious users, and users of prohibited applications.}}

In the community network model with hybrid coupling, the inner connections are in the same type of coupling within the same community and in different types of coupling in different communities. The connections between different pair of communities are also nonidentical. Cluster synchronization of community network with hybrid coupling is investigated via adaptive couplings control scheme. Effective controllers are designed for constructing an effective control scheme and adjusting automatically the adaptive external coupling strength by taking external coupling strength as adaptive variables on a small fraction of network edges. Moreover, the impact of the topology on the synchronizability of community network is investigated. The numerical results reveal that the number of links between communities and the degree of the connector nodes have significant effects on the synchronization performance.}}

In this paper, we propose a Network Coding with Crowdsourcing-based Trajectory Estimation (NC/CTE) method to transmit data in vehicular networks. Key points are designated beforehand in movement area. Every node estimates which of Key points the other nodes in the discovered area close to at the different times. The estimation is completed by every node in crowdsourcing method based on the pre-trajectory of GPS navigation. Network coding, recoding and reverse forwarding are used for data transmission according to the result of trajectory estimation. Simulation results show that NC/CTE is able to cut down 1/2 overhead messages of TBNC when mobile nodes have shared their GPS trajectories. It improves the reliability and scalability of vehicular networks.}}

Therefore, this study explored how the composition of older adults' social companionship networks is related to the frequency of landline and mobile phone communication with their network members. In addition, the study examined the association between landline and mobile phone communication as well as their relationship with in-person communication in such networks. The survey data were gathered using an ego-centered social support approach in a nationwide representative sample of retired older adults in Slovenia. The results of multiple regression analyses revealed that the composition of a social companionship network better predicts the frequency of landline rather than mobile phone communication of older adults with their network members. The non-significant relationship between the frequency of landline and mobile phone communication suggested that the two technologies very likely have a different role in the maintenance of social companionship networks. The study also found a difference between the importance of control variables related to the socio-demographic characteristics of older adults for the frequency of landline and mobile phone communication. While age, education, and living alone significantly predicted the frequency of mobile communication with older adults' network members, significant predictors of their landline communication included gender and health impairments.}}

Accordingly, three-layer BP neural network models with five input factors were developed to predict the ignition characteristics of power coal blends. The BP neural network for ignition temperature gave a relative mean error of 1.22%, which was considerably lower than 3.7% obtained by the quadratic polynomial regression. The BP neural network for activation energy gave a relative mean error of 3.89%, which was considerably lower than 10.3% obtained by the quadratic polynomial regression. The accuracy of the BP neural network was significantly higher than that of traditional polynomial regression.}}

Furthermore, the time-based feature of proposed model allows it to specify the investments/reinforcements time (i.e. year). Moreover, a minimum load shedding-based analytical approach for optimizing the network's reliability is introduced. The associated objective function of proposed model is minimizing the total investment and operation costs. To solve the formulated MEPDN model as a complex multi-dimensional optimization problem, a new evolutionary algorithm-based solution method called BCSSO (Binary Chaotic Shark Smell Optimization) is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed MEPDN model and solution approach is illustrated by applying them on two widely-used test cases including 12-bus and 33-bus distribution network and comparing the acquired results with the results of other solution methods.}}

Regarding the plasticity, we consider Hebbian rules, specifically for spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and with regard to network, we consider that the connections are randomly distributed. We analyse the synchronisation and desynchronisation according to an input level and probability of connections. Moreover, we verify that the transition for synchronisation depends on the neuronal network architecture, and the external perturbation level.}}

It intends to reassemble the heterogeneous elements involved in this network and analyze its structure by identifying, describing, and characterizing the different positions of the actors involved in the public debate. Through an interpretative case study, it seeks to reveal some of the contradictions present in this process and discuss them within the ANT framework. It can be argued that public debate concerning NN has revealed acute internal contradictions between interest groups and created disputes between actors from different levels of this network, which requires a constant rearrangement of positions. The findings of this study suggest the need of socio-ecological transition by fostering social consensus but also dialogue and competition while actively taking economic and industrial constraints and opportunities simultaneously into account. A coherent approach to socio-ecological understanding is an effective means of governing neutrality.}}

In the present study, we used intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) as a model of altered neurodevelopment due to prenatal condition to show the suitability of brain networks to characterise functional brain organisation at neonatal age. Particularly, we analysed resting-state fMRI signal of 20 neonates with IUGR and 13 controls, obtaining whole-brain functional networks based on correlations of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in 90 grey matter regions of an anatomical atlas (AAL). Characterisation of the networks obtained with graph theoretical features showed increased network infrastructure and raw efficiencies but reduced efficiency after normalisation, demonstrating hyper-connected but sub-optimally organised IUGR functional brain networks. Significant association of network features with neurobehavioral scores was also found. Further assessment of spatiotemporal dynamics displayed alterations into features associated to frontal, cingulate and lingual cortices. These findings show the capacity of functional brain networks to characterise brain reorganisation from an early age, and their potential to develop biomarkers of altered neurodevelopment.}}

The existing research usually searches the subset of resources in the whole substrate network passively for the virtual networks (VNs), where resource consolidation achieves the minimization of energy consumption by switching off or hibernating as many network nodes and interfaces as possible. However, the stable active resources for accommodating the VNs help enhance the number of the hibernated nodes and links, which can reduce the energy consumption. A novel method for energy efficient virtual network embedding (EEVNE) is proposed in this paper, which controls the mappable area of the substrate network actively and can find the minimal consolidation of the network resources. In our proposed method, a controller, a check device and an actuator are designed for finding the stable consolidated subset of the substrate resources. Besides, two feedback-control-based EEVNE algorithms are devised to minimize the energy consumption of the substrate network for embedding VNs. Simulation results show that our algorithms significantly save greater energy than the existing algorithms.}}

This SCNN is constructed via simultaneous structure and parameter learning processes. In structure learning, the units, which lead to the maximal error reduction of the network, are selected from the candidates and added to the existing network one by one. A stopping criterion based on the training and validation errors is introduced to select the optimal network size to match with a given application. In parameter learning, the weights connected with the output units are incrementally updated without gradients or generalized inverses, while the other weights are randomly assigned and no need to be tuned. Then, the convergence of SCNN is analyzed. Finally, the proposed SCNN is tested on two benchmark nonlinear systems and an actual municipal sewage treatment system. The experiment results show that the proposed SCNN has better performance on nonlinear system modeling than other similar methods.}}

In practice, road network planning has focused on road capacity and transport efficiency whereas the safety level of a road network has received little attention in the planning stage. This study develops a Bayesian hierarchical joint model for road network safety evaluation to help planners take traffic safety into account when planning a road network. The proposed model establishes relationships between road network risk and micro-level variables related to road entities and traffic volume, as well as socioeconomic, trip generation and network density variables at macro level which are generally used for long term transportation plans. In addition, network spatial correlation between intersections and their connected road segments is also considered in the model. A road network is elaborately selected in order to compare the proposed hierarchical joint model with a previous joint model and a negative binomial model. According to the results of the model comparison, the hierarchical joint model outperforms the joint model and negative binomial model in terms of the goodness-of-fit and predictive performance, which indicates the reasonableness of considering the hierarchical data structure in crash prediction and analysis. Moreover, both random effects at the TAZ level and the spatial correlation between intersections and their adjacent segments are found to be significant, supporting the employment of the hierarchical joint model as an alternative in road-network-level safety modeling as well.}}

These critical points consist of many lines in the parameter space which could be local minima or saddle points. Local minima cause plateaus which have a strong negative influence on learning. However, most of the critical points of complex-valued neural network are saddle points unlike those of the real-valued neural network.

Another desirable characteristic of the proposed method is that it gets results very close to those obtained by simulation, but orders of magnitude faster.}}

In this paper, by taking into account the shortest distance between a target node and the node set with the highest k -core value, we present an improved method to generate the ranking list to evaluate the node spreading influence. Comparing with the epidemic process results for four real networks and the Barabási–Albert network, the parameterless method could identify the node spreading influence more accurately than the ones generated by the degree k , closeness centrality, k -shell and mixed degree decomposition methods. This work would be helpful for deeply understanding the node importance of a network.}}

Firstly, the sum of delays is chosen as the bifurcation parameter, the conditions of the existence for the Hopf bifurcation are obtained by analyzing the associated characteristic equation. Then, it is the first time that a hybrid controller is designed to control the Hopf bifurcation for the proposed network. It is demonstrated that both fractional order and feedback gain can effectively control the dynamics of such network, the stability domain can be extended under the small fractional order or feedback gain. The controller is enough to delay the onset of the Hopf bifurcation and achieve some desirable dynamical behaviors by changing the appropriate order or feedback gain. Finally, numerical simulations are employed to justify the validity of our theoretical analysis.}}

For a known interconnection structure it is shown that the classical prediction error methods for closed-loop identification can be generalized to provide consistent model estimates, under specified experimental circumstances. Two classes of methods considered in this paper are the direct method and the joint-IO method that rely on consistent noise models, and indirect methods that rely on external excitation signals like two-stage and IV methods. Graph theoretical tools are presented to verify the topological conditions under which the several methods lead to consistent module estimates.}}

This community is a model for several similar efforts, both public and commercial, and even for the knowledge economy of the future e-society. For these reasons, issues of quality, social processes, and motivation within the Wikipedia knowledge community have attracted attention of researchers. Research has often used Social Network Analysis applied to networks created based on behavioral data available from the edit history of the Wikipedia. This paper asks the following question: are the popular assumptions about the social interpretations of networks created from the edit history valid? We verify commonly assumed interpretations of four types of networks created from discussions on Wikipedia talk pages, co-edits and reverts in Wikipedia articles, and edits of articles in various topics, by comparing these networks with results from a survey of editors of the Polish Wikipedia community. The results indicate that while the behavioral networks are strongly related to the declarations of respondents, only in one case of the network created from talk pages and interpreted as acquaintance we can observe a near equivalence. The article next describes improved definitions of behavioral indicators obtained through machine learning. The improved networks are much closer to their declarative counterparts. The main contribution of the article is a validated model of an acquaintance network among Wikipedia editors that can be derived from behavioral data and validly interpreted as acquaintance. Other contributions are improved versions of behavioral networks based on editing behavior and discussion history on the Wikipedia.}}

Hence, when the evolutionary behaviors of players with bounded rationality are investigated, it is reasonable to make an assumption that players in system are with limited memory. Besides, in order to unravel the intricate variability of complex systems in real world and make a highly integrative understanding of their dynamics, in recent years, interdependent networks as a comprehensive network structure have obtained more attention in this community. In this article, the evolution of cooperation in memory-based prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) on interdependent networks composed by two coupled square lattices is studied. Herein, all or part of players are endowed with finite memory ability, and we focus on the mutual influence of memory effect and interdependent network reciprocity on cooperation of spatial PDG. We show that the density of cooperation can be significantly promoted within an optimal region of memory length and interdependent strength. Furthermore, distinguished by whether having memory ability/external links or not, each kind of players on networks would have distinct evolutionary behaviors. Our work could be helpful to understand the emergence and maintenance of cooperation under the evolution of memory-based players on interdependent networks.}}

This article provides an investigation of heuristic effects in individual linking decisions for network formation in an incentivized lab-experimental setting. Our mixed logit analysis demonstrates that the inherent complexity of the network linking setting causes individuals' choices to be systematically less guided by payoff but more guided by simpler heuristic decision cues, and that this shift is systematically stronger for social payoff than for own payoff. Furthermore, we show that the specific complexity factors value transferability and social tradeoff aggravate the former effect. These heuristic effects have important research and policy implications in areas that involve network formation.}}

To address this concern, angular segment analysis (ASA) was introduced. ASA calculates spatial depths by considering the turning angles of path segments in a street network. However, ASA cannot calculate the attributes of nodes connected to path segments in the network because it analyzes spaces by linear representation, as in the original space syntax. Because the attributes of the two ends (nodes) of a given path segment (link) are not equal to each other, and because they can affect pedestrian and vehicle movement and land use in a street network, the identification of the attributes at nodes (points) would be helpful in the detailed analysis of spaces in the network consisting of nodes and the segments connecting them. Accordingly, this study aims to develop an extended analysis model that can calculate the attributes of spaces at the nodes, including terminuses, bends, and junctions, in the network. To achieve this end, in this study we developed algorithms for a point-based angular analysis (PAA) to find the attributes of spaces at nodes (points), in contrast to ASA, which analyzes spaces using linear representations. As a result, this methodology can obtain distinct values for the attributes of two nodes at the ends of a path segment, through the calculation of spatial depths weighted by considering the turning angles and distances (lengths) along consecutive nodes for a route in the network. Through our methodology, it was identified that spatial configurations of street network affect the social and symbolic centralities of nodes in the network. We believe that our methodology can be a useful tool for planning urban streets and for deriving spatial and social relationships in street networks.}}

Finding out the explanations behind the phenomena that networked systems can still function efficiently after some structural damages or the malfunction of certain nodes is meaningful to both the design of solid systems and the defend against failures. It is still indistinct what kind of resilience networked systems which change their topological structures incessantly over time might have. Nevertheless, earlier studies have frequently overlooked to consider the temporal characteristics which in many real scenarios are of great concern, or have considered only the temporality without spatiality which is not reasonable in the real world case. In this paper, we first take the spatiality of connections and communications between nodes, except for the temporal ordering of connection events which has solely been noticed by previous studies, into consideration for measuring and assessing the robustness of the temporal network. We propose a novel temporal efficiency metric, and correspondingly, develop a new temporal robustness evaluation method for temporal network models. The proposed metric and method show their validity through numerical simulations of three temporal network models and we give our evaluations and discussions.}}

This opens many possibilities for future policy applications with disaggregated model regions and sectors. The paper furthermore contributes to trade theory by deriving a straightforward rule for the optimal tariff respectively trade barrier.

The analysis identifies strong repercussions on global trade caused by increased trans-Pacific trade.}}

An integrated viewpoint opens a new window on optimization analysis. Among various networks, district heating networks are very promising for energy saving and carbon emission reduction. In this paper, effects of utilizing this network on optimization of a multi-carrier energy system are shown. However, such a problem has a considerable number of variables that makes a non-linear, non-convex, non-smooth, and high-dimension optimization problem and the optimal solution cannot be achieved by conventional mathematical techniques. Therefore, it is better to use evolutionary algorithms instead. In this paper, the well-known modified teaching-learning based optimization algorithm is used to solve the problem. Various simulations on a typical system show the impacts of a district heating network in the multi-carrier energy system.}}

A multi-temporal simulation model, which has been implemented in a relevant MATLAB-Excel VBA tool, is presented in this paper to carry out integrated analysis of electricity, heat and gas distribution networks, with specific applications to multi-vector district energy systems. The network linkages have been modelled through a multi-vector efficiency matrix specifically developed to map the transformation of final demands into network energy flows while taking into account the inter-network locations of the individual supply technologies. The relevant coupled electrical, heat and gas flow equations have been solved simultaneously using a Newton–Raphson approach. A real case study of a district multi-energy system in the Campus of the University of Manchester illustrates the quantitative use of the model in different scenarios for technical, economic and environmental studies. Sankey diagrams of the energy flows across the networks are also presented to give a visual picture of the multi-energy interactions and losses in the district in different scenarios. The model can be flexibly adapted to generic network topologies and multi-energy supply technologies, and can thus be used for practical operational implementations as well as to inform planning of low carbon multi-vector energy systems.}}

Additionally, network sampling is lately often applied to large networks to allow for their faster and more efficient analysis. Nevertheless, the changes in network structure introduced by sampling are still far from understood. In this paper, we study the presence of characteristic groups of nodes in sampled social and information networks. We consider different network sampling techniques including random node and link selection, network exploration and expansion. We first observe that the structure of social networks reveals densely linked groups like communities, while the structure of information networks is better described by modules of structurally equivalent nodes. However, despite these notable differences, the structure of sampled networks exhibits stronger characterization by community-like groups than the original networks, irrespective of their type and consistently across various sampling techniques. Hence, rich community structure commonly observed in social and information networks is to some extent merely an artifact of sampling.}}

abstract = {Summary Tropomyosins are coiled-coil proteins that bind actin filaments and regulate multiple cytoskeletal functions, including actin network dynamics near the leading edge of motile cells. Previous work demonstrated that tropomyosins inhibit actin nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex and prevent filament disassembly by cofilin. We find that the Arp2/3 complex and cofilin, in turn, regulate the binding of tropomyosin to actin filaments. Using fluorescence microscopy, we show that tropomyosin (non-muscle Drosophila Tm1A) polymerizes along actin filaments, starting from "nuclei" that appear preferentially on ADP-bound regions of the filament, near the pointed end. Tropomyosin fails to bind dendritic actin networks created in vitro by the Arp2/3 complex, in part because the Arp2/3 complex blocks pointed ends. Cofilin promotes phosphate dissociation and severs filaments, generating new pointed ends and rendering Arp2/3-generated networks competent to bind tropomyosin. Tropomyosin's attraction to pointed ends reflects a strong preference for conformations localized to that region of the filament and reveals a basic molecular mechanism by which lamellipodial actin networks are insulated from the effects of tropomyosin.}}

Aiming an automated management to detect and prevent potential problems, we present and compare two novel anomaly detection mechanisms based on statistical procedure Principal Component Analysis and the Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic. These methods generate a traffic profile, called Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow analysis (DSNSF), which is adopted as normal network behavior. Then, this signature is compared with the real network traffic by using a modification of the Dynamic Time Warping metric in order to recognize anomalous events. Thus, a seven-dimensional analysis of IP flows is performed, allowing the characterization of bits, packets and flows traffic transmitted per second, and the extraction of descriptive flow attributes, like source IP address, destination IP address, source TCP/UDP port and destination TCP/UDP port. The systems were evaluated using a real network environment and showed promising results. Moreover, the correspondence between true-positive and false-positive rates demonstrates that the systems are able to enhance the detection of anomalous behavior by maintaining a satisfactory false-alarm rate.}}

In most of these "single contaminant methods", a maximum allowable concentration of contaminants must be established in water demands and water sources. Turbidity is not a contaminant concentration but is a property that represents the "sum" of other contaminants, with the advantage that it can be cheaper and easily measured than biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, dissolved solids, among others. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that turbidity can be used directly in the design of water networks just like any other contaminant concentration. A mathematical demonstration is presented and in order to validate the mathematical results, the design of a water network for a guava fudge production process is performed. The material recovery pinch diagram and nearest neighbors algorithm were used for the design of the water network. Nevertheless, this water network could be designed using other single contaminant methodologies. The maximum error between the expected and the real turbidity values in the water network was 3.3%. These results corroborate the usefulness of turbidity in the design of water networks.}}

This study investigates the differences in neural network activity during the playing of both versions of the video game. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded ongoing brain activity of 18 young men playing the violence-related and the non-violence-related version of the video game Carmageddon. Image time series were decomposed into functional connectivity (FC) patterns using independent component analysis (ICA) and template-matching yielded a mapping to established functional brain networks. The FC patterns revealed a decrease in connectivity within 6 brain networks during the violence-related compared to the non-violence-related condition: three sensory-motor networks, the reward network, the default mode network (DMN), and the right-lateralized frontoparietal network. Playing violent racing games may change functional brain connectivity, in particular and even after controlling for event frequency, in the reward network and the DMN. These changes may underlie the short-term increase of aggressive affects, cognitions, and behaviors as observed after playing violent video games.}}

Viral marketing, one of its applications, aims to select a small set of users to adopt a product, so that the word-of-mouth effect can subsequently trigger a large cascade of further adoption in social networks. The problem of influence maximization is to select a set of K nodes from a social network so that the spread of influence is maximized over the network. Previous research on mining top-K influential nodes assumes that all of the selected K nodes can propagate the influence as expected. However, some of the selected nodes may not function well in practice, which leads to influence loss of top-K nodes. In this paper, we study an alternative influence maximization problem which is naturally motivated by the reliability constraint of nodes in social networks. We aim to find top-K influential nodes given a threshold of influence loss due to the failure of a subset of R(&lt;K) nodes. To solve the new type of influence maximization problem, we propose an approach based on constrained simulated annealing and further improve its performance through efficiently estimating the influence loss. We provide experimental results over multiple real-world social networks in support. This research will further support practical applications of social networks in various domains particularly where reliability would be a main concern in a system deployment.}}

We present and explore the utility of a network projection approach to finding patterns in health care data that could be exploited to prevent homelessness among U.S. Veterans. Method We split Veteran ICD-9-CM data into two time periods (0-59 and 60-364 days prior to the first evidence of homelessness) and then used Pajek social network analysis software to visualize these data as three different networks. A multi-relational network simultaneously displayed the magnitude of ties between the most frequent ICD-9-CM pairings. A new association network visualized ICD-9-CM pairings that greatly increased or decreased. A signed, subtraction network visualized the presence, absence, and magnitude difference between ICD-9-CM associations by time period. Result A cohort of 9,468 U.S. Veterans was identified as having administrative evidence of homelessness and visits in both time periods. They were seen in 222,599 outpatient visits that generated 484,339 ICD-9-CM codes (average of 11.4 (range 1-23) visits and 2.2 (range 1-60) ICD-9-CM codes per visit). Using the three network projection methods, we were able to show distinct differences in the pattern of co-morbidities in the two time periods. In the more distant time period preceding homelessness, the network was dominated by routine health maintenance visits and physical ailment diagnoses. In the 59 days immediately prior to the homelessness identification, alcohol related diagnoses along with economic circumstances such as unemployment, legal circumstances, along with housing instability were noted. Conclusion Network visualizations of large clinical datasets traditionally treated as tabular and difficult to manipulate reveal rich, previously hidden connections between data variables related to homelessness. A key feature is the ability to visualize changes in variables with temporality and in proximity to the event of interest. These visualizations lend support to cognitive tasks such as exploration of large clinical datasets as a prelude to hypothesis generation.}}

Recently researchers developed the quasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington's landscape. The Quasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network (GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which determine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical system. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for continuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are important tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework to quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our framework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models is considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development. We impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to specific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to stable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas development. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint corresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to restrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that BNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics of pancreas cell differentiation. This framework can also determine the genes' influence on cell state transitions, and thus can facilitate the rational design of cell reprogramming protocols.}}

Method Closeness centrality and small-worldness were compared between pre-stimulus baseline and response windows of an odd-ball task in 200 healthy individuals. The correlation between modulation of network parameters and clinical (scores in the Community Assessment of Psychological Experiences) and cognitive measures (performance in the dimensions included in the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia battery) was analyzed, as well as between these measures and the corresponding network parameters during baseline and response windows during task performance. Results In the theta band, closeness centrality decreased and small-worldness increased in the response window. Centrality and small-worldness modulation were, respectively, directly and inversely associated with subclinical symptoms. Conclusions A widespread modulation of network properties in theta band was observed, with a transient increase of small-worldness during the response window, compatible with a transiently more integrated cortical activity associated to cognition. This supports the relevance of electroencephalography to study of normal and altered cognition and its substrates. A relative deficit in the ability to reorganize brain networks may contribute to subclinical psychotic symptoms.}}

Intelligent network models such as radial basis function (RBF), back propagation (BP) neural network and support vector machine (SVM) model can be used for gas dispersion prediction. However, the prediction results from these network models with too many inputs based on original monitoring parameters are not in good agreement with the experimental data. Then, a new series of machine learning algorithms (MLA) models combined classic Gaussian model with MLA algorithm has been presented. The prediction results from new models are improved greatly. Among these models, Gaussian-SVM model performs best and its computation time is close to that of classic Gaussian dispersion model. Finally, Gaussian-MLA models were applied to identifying the emission source parameters with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. The estimation performance of PSO with Gaussian-MLA is better than that with Gaussian, Lagrangian stochastic (LS) dispersion model and network models based on original monitoring parameters. Hence, the new prediction model based on Gaussian-MLA is potentially a good method to predict contaminant gas dispersion as well as a good forward model in emission source parameters identification problem.}}

Previous studies on the robustness of coupled networks except for interdependent networks are almost the cases of random attack. Many challenges remain exist in targeted-attack problem of coupled networks. Since nodes within coupled networks show different functions for each network, this paper both analytically and numerically analyzed the robustness of coupled networks under three types of targeted attacking strategies, including attacking on nodes by considering internal and external degree, internal degree only, and external degree only. For coupled network with both interdependent and interconnected links, all degree distributions of intra- and inter-connectivity links are Poissonian, we find the system undergoes from second to first order phase transition as coupling strength q increases. The fraction of nodes in the giant component P infinity at stable state, the critical phase transition threshold p c (first order threshold p c I and second order threshold p c I I ), and the critical point ( p c , q c ) separating the first and second order phase transitions are analytically obtained for three types of attacking strategies with attacking probability parameter alpha = 0 , 1 . We also find the system becomes more vulnerable as the average degree of intra-links k ̄ or inter-links K ̄ decreases. Therefore, the minimum average degrees k ̄ m i n and K ̄ m i n to maintain the system stable are obtained for the case of alpha = 0 , 1 . Moreover, we discussed three typical cases of coupled networks, interdependent networks ( K ̄ = 0 ), interacting networks ( q = 0 ) and bipartite network ( k = 0 , q = 0 ), the analytical expressions of P infinity , p c and ( p c , q c ) (only for interdependent) are given respectively. Besides, we study the equivalence relations between interdependent networks and coupled networks with connectivity and dependency links for the same p c . The results imply that we can adjust the parameters q , k ̄ and K ̄ to make the two systems have the same robustness. Moreover, the results imply that one should not only protect nodes with high degree of intra-links or inter-links, but also defend nodes, the sum of whose degree of intra-links and inter-links is big, can avoid the system becoming vulnerable.}}

Phenomena such as viscoelasticity and strain-hardening followed by strain-softening are observed experimentally in these networks, often due to microstructural changes (such as filament sliding, rupture and cross-link debonding). Further, composite structures can also be formed with vastly different mechanical properties as compared to the individual networks. In this present paper, we present a constitutive model presented in a continuum framework aimed at capturing these effects. Special care is taken to formulate thermodynamically consistent evolution laws for dissipative effects. This model, incorporating possible anisotropic network properties, is based on a strain energy function, split into an isochoric and a volumetric part. Generalisation to three dimensions is performed by numerical integration over the unit sphere. Model predictions indicate that the constitutive model is well able to predict the elastic and viscoelastic response of biological networks, and to an extent also composite structures.}}

Two complex networks are distinct if they have diverse node dynamics, or different number of nodes, or different topological structures. By using the adaptive control scheme, a sufficient synchronization criterion for this GPS is derived based on the LaSalle invariance principle. Three corollaries are also obtained. It is noticed that the synchronization speed sensitively depends on the adjustable positive constants μ i . Furthermore, the coupling configuration matrix is not necessary to be symmetric or irreducible, and the inner coupling matrix need not be symmetric. In addition, the node dynamic need not satisfy the very strong and conservative uniformly Lipschitz condition. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.}}

The upper subnetwork, called the logical layer, employs the shortest paths protocol to determine the logical paths for packets transmission, while the lower subnetwork acts as the physical layer, in which packets are delivered by the biased random walk mechanism characterized with a parameter alpha . Through simulation, we obtain the optimal alpha corresponding to the maximum network lifetime and the maximum number of the arrival packets. Assortative coupling is better than random coupling and disassortative coupling, since it achieves better transmission performance. Generally, the more homogeneous the lower subnetwork is, the better the transmission performance, which is the opposite for the upper subnetwork. Finally, we propose an attack centrality for nodes based on the topological information of both subnetworks, and investigate the transmission performance under targeted attacks. Our work aids in understanding the spread and robustness issues of multiplex networks and provides some clues about the design of more efficient and robust routing architectures in communication systems.}}

The method aims at predicting precursor's major components contents (SiO2, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, and K2O). The prediction is based on ratios of elements generally immobile during alteration processes; i.e. Zr, TiO2, Al2O3, Y, Nb, Th, and Cr, which are provided as inputs to the neural networks. Multi-layer perceptron neural networks were trained on a large dataset of least-altered volcanic rock samples that document a wide range of volcanic rock types, tectonic settings and ages. The precursors thus predicted are then used to perform mass balance calculations. Various statistics were calculated to validate the predictions of precursors' major components, which indicate that, overall, the predictions are precise and accurate. For example, rank-based correlation coefficients were calculated to compare predicted and analysed values from a least-altered test dataset that had not been used to train the networks. Coefficients over 0.87 were obtained for all components, except for Na2O (0.77), indicating that predictions for alkali might be less performant. Also, predictions are performant for most volcanic rock compositions, except for ultra-K rocks. The proposed method provides an easy and rapid solution to the often difficult task of determining appropriate volcanic precursor compositions to rocks modified by hydrothermal alteration. It is intended for large volcanic rock databases and is most useful, for example, to mineral exploration performed in complex or poorly known volcanic settings. The method is implemented as a simple C++ console program.}}

abstract = {Abstract Majority of vibration problems arise in pipeline networks are attributed to the high-pressure pulsations. Pulsations are generated by fluid machines such as compressors and pumps. These pulsations turn into shaking forces at elements such as pipe bends and pipe reducers, which in turn excite vibrations in the connected piping network. High vibrations beyond the endurance limit of the pipe material may cause damage to pipes, supports, and equipment. In addition, if the source pulsation frequency coincides with one of the natural frequencies of the piping network, resonance will take place and the vibrations will be magnified to a large scale. Obviously, if these vibrations are not well controlled, they might cause damage to the whole system and foundation, and might lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, prediction of pulsations is important for safe and proper operation. In this paper, a pilot plant equipped with a reciprocating compressor, pipes, bends, and terminated by a vessel is built. The network is modeled using the two-port theory that splits the network into several cascaded elements, and predicts the response of the network. The prediction model uses the measured compressor source data as an input, which is determined by the indirect multi-load method that is usually used to characterize internal combustion engines. A pulsation suppression device is designed, modeled, manufactured and inserted into the pilot network. The pressure pulsations are measured with and without the pulsation suppression device, and compared to the predictions using the two-port theory.}}

In this paper, a computer-aided synthesis method is introduced to synthesize optimal complex column arrangements which encode the cost and states of global solutions with minimum user input. A robust feasibility criterion helps select design and operating conditions for the entire network that can be realized in practice. Our method builds on thermodynamic transformations entitled temperature collocation which provides crucial advantages to determine the operating conditions, structure, and size of the separation network for achieving the desired product cuts. The computational approach guarantees realizable column profiles, which can be validated with industrially accepted simulation software such as AspenHysys and AspenPlus.}}

The novel concept of mission policies, which specify the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the incumbent networks as well as of the emergency networks involved in rescue and recovery missions, is introduced. The use of mission policies, which vary over time and space, enables graceful degradation in the QoS of the incumbent networks (only when necessary) based on mission policy specifications. A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based cross-layer communication framework, "RescueNet," is proposed for self-adaptation of nodes in emergency networks based on this new paradigm. In addition to addressing the research challenges posed by the non-stationarity of the problem, the novel idea of knowledge sharing among the agents of different ages (either bootstrapping or selective exploration strategies or both) is introduced to improve significantly the performance of the proposed solution in terms of convergence time and conformance to the mission policies.}}

Surprisingly, the derived communities for any self-organized and/or self-evolved large networks demonstrate very striking power laws, implying that there are far more small communities than large ones. This notion of far more small things than large ones constitutes a new fundamental way of thinking for community detection.}}

The findings suggest that the key players in all three provinces are producers who raise their cattle as backyard animals. In all three provinces the key players in spreading disease are probably the middlemen, collectors, brokers or traders. The network of cattle movement is presented as a strong component of varying size in each location. In this network we found three cut-points in both Kampong Cham and Kampong Speu. The network in each province indicates a random pattern of node distribution. The results of our study are useful to relevant authorities and researchers to understand the spread of infectious diseases into different areas.

In last decade many countries have begun a liberalization process of their electrical systems by opening access to transmission and distribution networks. This has been accompanied by a fast growth in the presence of small generators distributed, of several technologies, many of them based on renewable energy sources. However, there are still technical, economic and regulatory barriers that limit the definitive boost of distributed generation (DG). The increase of connections in many cases, has been based on the philosophy "fit and forget" and capacity of installed DG remains limited by Distribution Network Operators. In this article are reviewed those factors that can contribute most to the necessary evolution of DG, to overcome the current paradigm of renewable distributed generation sources "integrated in a real network", and reach a stage of DG units "embedded in the new distribution networks".

To ensure the Internet security, effective detection and mitigation for such attacks are indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative intrusion prevention architecture, i.e. CIPA, aiming at confronting such coordinated intrusion behavior. CIPA is deployed as a virtual network of an artificial neural net over the substrate of networks. Taking advantage of the parallel and simple mathematical manipulation of neurons in a neural net, CIPA can disperse its lightweight computation power to the programmable switches of the substrate. Each programmable switch virtualizes one to several neurons. The whole neural net functions like an integrated IDS/IPS. This allows CIPA to detect distributed attacks on a global view. Meanwhile, it does not require high communication and computation overhead. It is scalable and robust. To validate CIPA, we have realized a prototype on Software-Defined Networks. We also conducted simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that CIPA is effective.}}

If there is no explicit function, optimization problem can be solved by using the Lagrange multiplier method, which combines the optimization objective and the constraints. However, heat exchanger networks with many heat exchangers have a large number of variables and constraint equations in the Lagrange function, which slows the optimization solution. A crank mechanism is used as an example to indicate that the Lagrange multiplier method can be simplified in a generalized coordinate instead of Cartesian coordinates. Inspired by the use of generalized coordinates in multi-body systems, the entransy balance equation for the heat exchanger network is introduced here as a new constraint to replace the conventional constraints of heat transfer and energy conservation equations for the optimization of a loop-connected heat exchanger network. As a result, the number of variables and constraints in the Lagrange multiplier function is reduced and the solution is simplified. In this sense, the entransy balance equation can be termed as the generalized constraint. Finally, the reason for the simplification function of the entransy dissipation-based generalized constraint is explored.}}

Such connectivity is measurable using neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, however the richness of the electrophysiological signal makes gaining a complete picture challenging. Specifically, connectivity can be calculated as statistical interdependencies between neural oscillations within a large range of different frequency bands. Further, connectivity can be computed between frequency bands. This pan-spectral network hierarchy likely helps to mediate simultaneous formation of multiple brain networks, which support ongoing task demand. However, to date it has been largely overlooked, with many electrophysiological functional connectivity studies treating individual frequency bands in isolation. Here, we combine oscillatory envelope based functional connectivity metrics with a multi-layer network framework in order to derive a more complete picture of connectivity within and between frequencies. We test this methodology using MEG data recorded during a visuomotor task, highlighting simultaneous and transient formation of motor networks in the beta band, visual networks in the gamma band and a beta to gamma interaction. Having tested our method, we use it to demonstrate differences in occipital alpha band connectivity in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. We further show that these connectivity differences are predictive of the severity of persistent symptoms of the disease, highlighting their clinical relevance. Our findings demonstrate the unique potential of MEG to characterise neural network formation and dissolution. Further, we add weight to the argument that dysconnectivity is a core feature of the neuropathology underlying schizophrenia.}}

abstract = {Abstract Advanced Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) applications may need to develop multiple tasks that involve sensing, processing and gathering data from different sensing units. This heterogeneous data may have multiple and sometimes opposite sets of requirements. In these scenarios, different networking strategies must be combined, and therefore traditional single-tree routing approaches are not efficient. On the contrary, the well-known RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) protocol virtually splits the network into multiple RPL Instances, that transport each kind of data according to its particular objective function. However, this protocol does not define any mechanism to decide the nodes that must belong to each instance, and this decision has a strong impact in the network energy consumption and performance. With this in mind, in this paper we introduce C-RPL (Cooperative-RPL). This creates multiple instances following a cooperative strategy among nodes with different sensing tasks. As a result, the energy consumption, the complexity and the cost of the nodes is reduced compared to RPL, since they are active less time, perform fewer tasks and are equipped with less sensing hardware. In this paper we also propose a novel fairness analysis for networks with multiple instances, showing that C-RPL achieves a better tradeoff, in terms of performance and energy consumption, than RPL with non-cooperative instances.}}

The model consists of four most important events in the evolution of network topology: node addition, node departure, connection establishment, and edge deletion. Based on the model, we derive a difference equation of degree distribution, which can be solved analytically. By analyzing the solutions, we find that there are two factors affecting the degree distribution. The first one represents the internal dynamics of network topology, while the second one represents the external influence. We find that the internal dynamics makes the degree distribution follow power law while the external influence makes it deviate from power law. User behaviors and resource distributions are the main reasons for this deviation.}}

The considered system has the following main features: (1) it is a nonlinear system approximated by a T–S fuzzy model; (2) subsystems are connected through wired or wireless networks and therefore signal transfer in/among subsystems is subject to communication delay and/or packet loss; and (3) the network transmission capacity is limited. A discrete decentralized event-triggering scheme (DDETS) is proposed to overcome the network bandwidth limitation, which can reduce data transmission in subsystems effectively. By employing the above main features and using the DDETS, a new system model is proposed. Then the Lyapunov functional approach is applied to development of two stability conditions (Theorems 1 and 2), which are used to design filters and triggering matrices of each subsystem simultaneously. Finally, an example is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed method.}}

In the process, a new combination of participatory methods was applied, including two participatory modeling approaches that are based on causal networks and the participatory development of qualitative normative scenarios. After the participatory process the combination of methods was evaluated regarding the ability to 1) map out the diversity of stakeholders' perspectives, 2) to grasp the complexity of the problem, 3) to make uncertainty of complex problems transparent and 4) to support the identification of implementable strategies. Evaluation results showed that the applied methods were able to fulfill criteria 1) to 3). Specifically, application of actor modeling lead to fulfillment of criteria 1) and 2), while normative scenario generation addressed criterion 3). Criterion 4) was only partly fulfilled due to lack of credibility of the Bayesian Network modeling results. This was caused by the high uncertainty of the conditional probabilities elicited from experts, as there is little empirical system knowledge in particular about the potential effects of management options. On the other hand, stakeholders were not sufficiently involved in the construction and application of Bayesian Network models during the participatory process.}}

Using social network analysis (SNA), three measures of centrality were investigated: popularity (i.e., the number of incoming ties a participant receives), gregariousness (i.e., the number of ties leaving from a participant and reaching out to others), and betweenness (i.e., the number of times a person lies between two other individuals). In line with the idea that testosterone and cortisol jointly regulate the emergence of social status, we found that individuals with high basal testosterone and low basal cortisol were more popular and more likely to act as connectors among other individuals (i.e., betweenness). The same hormonal profile was not predictive of gregariousness. However, in line with the small literature on the topic, we found that cortisol was inversely correlated with gregariousness. Despite the cross-sectional and correlational nature of our research design, these findings represent the first empirical evidence that testosterone and cortisol interact to predict complex measures of social hierarchy position derived from social network analyses.}}

This work comprises data mining of protein sequences related to the chitin metabolic pathway of completely sequenced genomes of extant organisms pertaining to the three life domains, followed by meta-analysis using traditional sequence similarity comparison and complex network approaches. Complex networks involving proteins of the chitin metabolic pathway in extant organisms were constructed based on protein sequence similarity. Several usual network indices were estimated in order to obtain information on the topology of these networks, including those related to higher order neighborhood properties. Due to the assumed evolutionary character of the system, we also discuss issues related to modularity properties, with the concept of edge betweenness playing a particularly important role in our analysis. Complex network approach correctly identifies clusters of organisms that belong to phylogenetic groups without any a priori knowledge about the biological features of the investigated protein sequences. We envisage the prospect of using such a complex network approach as a high-throughput phylogenetic method.}}

Many application protocols have been developed on the basis of retransmission mechanisms. The multipath transmission control protocol guarantees quality of service (QoS) and reduces data transmission time in modern computer networks. A computer network that employs a retransmission mechanism can be called a multi-state computer network with a retransmission mechanism (MSCNR), because communication lines used by such a network can experience different states such as failure, partial failure, and maintenance. This study firstly evaluates the network reliability of a MSCNR for transmitting data d successfully through multiple minimal paths (MPs) within a time threshold T. An algorithm is proposed for generating all lower boundary vectors (LBVs) that can satisfy a time threshold. Then, the network reliability is computed in terms of all LBVs for (d, T) using the recursive sum of disjoint products algorithm. Furthermore, a routing scheme with spare MPs is adopted to reinforce the system reliability (referred to as the spare reliability). The spare reliability can also be easily computed by the proposed procedure.}}

City planners usually demand thermal maps with a resolution below 50 m. The required input data for the statistical models were meteorological data at high resolution as well as land use and land cover data including morphological data. Meteorological data were obtained through car traverses on a measuring campaign on hot summer days in July 2014. The chosen statistical approaches of stepwise multiple linear regression and artificial neural network were compared for the case study area Stuttgart, Germany. The Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) was applied to analyse the human thermal conditions taking into account both the meteorological environment and the thermo-physiological parameters including the human energy balance. The polycentric and complex spatial distribution of heat stress and heat load is clearly visible in the created maps. One hot spot is the city centre and its surrounding residential neighbourhood, the other hot spot can be detected in Bad Cannstatt (easterly of the Neckar river valley), including industrial and residential areas. Thereby, the non-linear artificial neural network model delivers better results than the stepwise multiple linear regression model. Advantages of the artificial neural network arise from the possibility to reveal non-linear dependencies and interactions between the variables resulting in a better model fit.}}

Additionally, frustration parameters for the interactions of the cross-network phases are introduced. This may be regarded as a model of competing populations: internal to any one network phase synchronisation is a target state, while externally one or both populations seek to frequency synchronise to a phase in relation to the competitor. We conduct fixed point analyses for two regimes: one, where internal phase synchronisation occurs for each population with the potential for instability in the phase of one population in relation to the other; the second where one part of a population remains fixed in phase in relation to the other population, but where instability may occur within the first population leading to ‘fragmentation'. We compare analytic results to numerical solutions for the system at various critical thresholds.}}

Meanwhile a bi-scale method is proposed to combine the information of microscale (neighbors) and mesoscale (communities) in the observed networks.

Also, data analysts have found a fertile field for analyzing user behavior at individual and collective levels, for academic and commercial reasons. On the other hand, there are many risks for user privacy, as information a user may wish to remain private becomes evident upon analysis. However, when data is anonymized to make it safe for publication in the public domain, information is inevitably lost with respect to the original version, a significant aspect of social networks being the local neighborhood of a user and its associated data. Current anonymization techniques are good at identifying risks and minimizing them, but not so good at maintaining local contextual data which relate users in a social network. Thus, improving this aspect will have a high impact on the data utility of anonymized social networks. Also, there is a lack of systems which facilitate the work of a data analyst in anonymizing this type of data structures and performing empirical experiments in a controlled manner on different datasets. Hence, in the present work we address these issues by designing and implementing a sophisticated synthetic data generator together with an anonymization processor with strict privacy guarantees and which takes into account the local neighborhood when anonymizing. All this is done for a complex dataset which can be fitted to a real dataset in terms of data profiles and distributions. In the empirical section we perform experiments to demonstrate the scalability of the method and the improvement in terms of reduction of information loss with respect to approaches which do not consider the local neighborhood context when anonymizing.}}

Thus, this work investigates the use of an artificial neural network (ANN), specifically a general regression neural network (GRNN), to provide real-time computation of DHM motion prediction, where the underlying optimization problems are large and computationally complex. In initial experimentation, a GRNN is used successfully to simulate walking and jumping on a box while using physics-based human simulations as training data. Compared to direct computational simulations of dynamic motion, use of GRNN reduces the calculation time for each predicted motion from 1–40 min to a fraction of a second with no noticeable reduction in accuracy. This work lays the foundation for studying the effects of changes to training regiments on human performance.}}

Recovering the communication infrastructure is typically slow and expensive, which is not suitable for emergency response. Multihop wireless access networks have the potential to quickly provide Internet connectivity to victims, but so far no simple and practical solution has been proposed to help people configure these networks easily. We are pursuing the approach of utilizing wireless virtualization techniques to establish wireless access networks on-the-fly using on-site mobile devices. While our previous work has demonstrated proof-of-concept solutions, it lacked fundamental communication abstractions, a rigorous design, and a thorough analysis on the effectiveness of these solutions. The main new contributions of this article are: (1) the wireless multihop communication abstraction (WMCA) as a fundamental communication concept for a practical tree-based disaster recovery access network (TDRAN), (2) the complete design and implementation details of TDRAN, and (3) a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on field experiments, both in indoor and outdoor settings, at different sites in Japan. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for on-site configuration of wireless access networks, as it can easily extend to 20 hops by 15 m-distance and 16 hops by 30 m-distance networks, which result in 300 m and 480 m (respectively) in radius or about 1 km in diameter. This work also confirms that our approach is ready for realization as a real disaster recovery solution.}}

To identify the main paths of online social networks, we proposed a method which measures the weights of links based on historical interaction records. The influence of node based on forwarding amount is quantified and top-ranked nodes are selected as the influential users. The path importance is evaluated by calculating the probability that a message would spread via this path. We applied our method to a real-world network and found interesting insights. Each influential user can access another one via a short main path and the distribution of main paths shows significant community effect.}}

Second, an event-triggering mechanism is proposed such that during the control implementation, only requisite sampled-data is transmitted over networks. Third, an event-triggered H infinity reliable control problem for the offshore structure is solved by employing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach, and the desired controller can be derived. It is shown through simulation results that for possible actuator failures, the networked controller is capable of guaranteeing the stability of the offshore structure. In addition, compared with the H infinity control scheme without network settings, the proposed controller can suppress the vibration of the offshore structure to almost the same level as the H infinity controller, while the former requires less control cost. Furthermore, under the network-based controller, the communication resources can be saved significantly.}}

First, we design a simple yet effective method to transfer the mid-level features learned from NIN on the source tasks with large scale training data to the tracking tasks with limited training data. Then, to address the drifting problem, we simultaneously utilize the samples collected in the initial and most previous frames.

The analysis of such mobility patterns and the understanding of how mobile nodes interact play a critical role when designing new routing protocols for DTNs. The Cultural Greedy Ant (CGrAnt) protocol is a hybrid Swarm Intelligence-based approach designed to address the routing problem in such dynamic and complex environment. CGrAnt is based on: (1) Cultural Algorithms (CA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and (2) operational metrics that characterize the opportunistic social connectivity between wireless users. The most promising message forwarders are selected via a greedy transition rule based mainly on local information captured from the DTN environment. Whenever global information is available, it can also be used to support decisions. We compare the performance of CGrAnt with Epidemic, PROPHET, and dLife protocols in two different mobility scenarios under varying networking parameters. Results obtained by the ONE simulator show that CGrAnt achieves a higher message delivery and lower message redundancy than the three protocols in both scenarios. The only exception is in one of the scenarios, when messages have a time to live lower than 900 min, where CGrAnt delivers a bit less messages than dLife, although with a lower message redundancy.}}

In this paper, we investigate the scaling properties of the weighted spectral distribution in several deterministic and stochastic models of evolving scale-free networks. First, we construct a new deterministic scale-free model whose node degrees have a unified format. Using graph structure features, we derive a precise formula for the spectral metric in this model. This formula verifies that the spectral metric grows sublinearly as network size (i.e., the number of nodes) grows. Additionally, the mathematical reasoning of the precise formula theoretically provides detailed explanations for this scaling property. Finally, we validate the scaling properties of the spectral metric using some stochastic models. The experimental results show that this scaling property can be retained regardless of local world, node deleting and assortativity adjustment.}}

To confirm the effectiveness of HDN, two similar networks constructed by support vector machine and back propagation neuron networks (BPNN) are employed to present a comprehensive comparison.

This task presents challenging aspects in complex lowland terrains with subtle relief and particularly for data poor-areas like the Cuvelai river basin (CRB), Namibia, where the present study takes place. In the CRB standard methods of drainage network extraction from low resolution gridded digital elevation models (DEMs) are unsuitable, hence airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) solutions have been utilized. However, LiDAR also presents challenges to large areal applications, especially with a surface roughness exceeding the capacity of numerous algorithms. Indeed, LiDAR-based DEMs (2 and 50 m resolutions) need to be hydrologically corrected and smoothed to enable the extraction of scale-relevant geomorphologic features such as DNs. In the present contribution, channels from topographic maps (blue lines) were compared to those from hydrologically corrected and uncorrected LiDAR DEMs, heads-up digitized channels from high-resolution digital aerial orthophotographs, field-mapped channels and auxiliary data. The ‘maximum gradient deterministic eight (D8)' GIS algorithm was applied to the corrected and uncorrected LiDAR DEMs using two network extraction methods: area threshold support and curvature/drop analysis. Different progressive flow accumulation threshold values (12) were used to delineate channels with these methods. Validation was performed between the field-mapped channels, the modelled channels and those derived from multiple sources. Additionally, spatial and quantitative analyses were performed on geomorphologic parameters and indices. The results have shown that hydrologically corrected LiDAR DEMs offer useful details for identifying low order stream segments in headwaters, while blue lines derived from the national hydrography datasets for watersheds, located in elevated and low-lying areas of the study area, underestimated total stream lengths for field-mapped channels by − 15.3% and − 88.5%, respectively. This study also confirmed that DNs can be extracted from complex low-terrain areas with standard GIS algorithms and accurate field data. The results will aid national mapping agencies in data-poor regions to modernize their national hydrography datasets and to account for changing land surface conditions that can affect channel spatial arrangements over time.}}

It is demonstrated that the coupling strengths are affected by topologies of the networks. Furthermore, it is found that there are hierarchical features in the processes of generalized synchronization in scale-free networks because of their highly heterogeneous distributions of connection degree. Finally, we discuss in detail how a network's degree of heterogeneity affects its generalization synchronization behavior.}}

The simulation results showed that the strain rate of compressive loading increases, so that a higher resistance of specimens to deformation is observed. Furthermore, the local deformation characteristics of CNT segments, which are mainly driven by bending and buckling modes, and their prevalence are strongly affected by the deformation rate. It was also observed that CNT networks have superior features to metal foams such as metal matrix syntactic foams (MMSFs) and porous sintered fiber metals (PSFMs) in terms of energy absorbing capabilities.}}

Particle-based contact laws, in turn, commonly rely on semi-empirical parameters which are difficult to obtain by direct microscopic measurements. In this study, we present a method for the identification of DEM simulation parameters that uses artificial neural networks to link macroscopic experimental results to microscopic numerical parameters. In the first step, a series of DEM simulations with varying simulation parameters is used to train a feed-forward artificial neural network by backward-propagation reinforcement. In the second step, this artificial neural network is used to predict the macroscopic ensemble behaviour in relation to additional sets of particle-based simulation parameters. Thus, a comprehensive database is obtained which links particle-based simulation parameters to specific macroscopic bulk behaviours of the ensemble. The trained artificial neural network is able to predict the behaviours of additional sets of input parameters accurately and highly efficiently. Furthermore, this method can be used generically to identify DEM material parameters. For each set of calibration experiments, the neural network needs to be trained only once. After the training, the neural network provides a generic link between the macroscopic experimental results and the microscopic DEM simulation parameters. Based on these experiments, the DEM simulation parameters of any given non-cohesive granular material can be identified.}}

Early neuroscientific evidence indicates that the firsthand and vicarious experiences of pain share largely overlapping neural structures, which typically correspond to the lateral and medial brain regions that encode the sensory and the affective qualities of pain. Such neural circuitry is highly malleable and allows people to flexibly adjust the empathic behavior depending on social and personal factors. Recent views posit, however, that the brain can be conceptualized as a complex system, in which behavior emerges from the interaction between functionally connected brain regions, organized into large-scale networks. Beyond the classical modular view of the brain, here we suggest that empathic behavior may be understood through a dynamic network-based approach where the cortical circuits associated with the experience of pain flexibly change in order to code self- and other-related emotions and to intrinsically map our mentality to empathetically react to others.}}

Among these studies, the methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used, which employ signal processing techniques for extracting features and further input the features to ANNs for classifying faults. Though these methods did work in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, they still have two deficiencies. (1) The features are manually extracted depending on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. In addition, these manual features are extracted according to a specific diagnosis issue and probably unsuitable for other issues. (2) The ANNs adopted in these methods have shallow architectures, which limits the capacity of ANNs to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues. As a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, deep learning holds the potential to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies. Through deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear functions. Based on DNNs, a novel intelligent method is proposed in this paper to overcome the deficiencies of the aforementioned intelligent diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings and planetary gearboxes. These datasets contain massive measured signals involving different health conditions under various operating conditions. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the measured signals, but also obtain superior diagnosis accuracy compared with the existing methods.}}

A variety of network performance goals, such as coverage, data rate and network lifetime, are considered as criteria to lead the placement of the nodes. In this work, a new relay placement approach to maximize network connectivity in a multi-hop wireless network is presented. Here, connectivity is defined as a combination of inter-node reachability and network throughput. The nodes are placed following a two-step procedure: (i) initial distribution, and (ii) solution selection. Additionally, a third stage for placement optimization is optionally proposed to maximize throughput. This tries to be a general approach for placement, and several initialization, selection and optimization algorithms can be used in each of the steps. For experimentation purposes, a leave-one-out selection procedure and a PSO related optimization algorithm are employed and evaluated for second and third stages, respectively. Other node placement solutions available in the literature are compared with the proposed one in realistic simulated scenarios. The results obtained through the properly devised experiments show the improvements achieved by the proposed approach.}}

Conversely, CD4+ T cells are the major producers of lymphotoxin-β (LT-β), necessary for the construction and maintenance of the FRC network. This interdependence creates the possibility of a vicious cycle, perpetuating loss of both FRC and T cells. Furthermore, evidence that HIV infection is responsible for collagenation of the network suggests that long term loss of network function might be responsible for the attenuated recovery in T cell count seen in HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART). We present computational and mathematical models of this interaction mechanism and subsequent naive CD4+ T-cell depletion in which (1) collagen deposition impedes access of naive T cells to IL-7 on the FRC and loss of IL-7 production by loss of FRC network itself, leading to the depletion of naive T cells through increased apoptosis; and (2) depletion of naive T cells as the source of LT-β on which the FRC depend for survival leads to loss of the network, thereby amplifying and perpetuating the cycle of depletion of both naive T cells and stromal cells. Our computational model explicitly includes an FRC network and its cytokine exchange with a heterogeneous T-cell population. We also derive lumped models, in terms of partial differential equations and reduced to ordinary differential equations, that provide additional insight into the mechanisms at work. The central conclusions are that (1) damage to the reticular network, caused by HIV infection is a plausible mechanism for attenuated recovery post-ART; (2) within this, the production of T cell survival factors by FRCs may be the key rate-limiting step; and (3) the methods of model reduction and analysis presented are useful for both immunological studies and other contexts in which agent-based models are severely limited by computational cost.}}

abstract = {This Letter studies the robustness problem of pinning a general complex dynamical network toward an assigned synchronous evolution. Several synchronization criteria are presented to guarantee the convergence of the pinning process locally and globally by construction of Lyapunov functions. In particular, if a pinning strategy has been designed for synchronization of a given complex dynamical network, then no matter what uncertainties occur among the pinned nodes, synchronization can still be guaranteed through the pinning. The analytical results show that pinning control has a certain robustness against perturbations on network architecture: adding, deleting and changing the weights of edges. Numerical simulations illustrated by scale-free complex networks verify the theoretical results above-acquired.}}

Thus, understanding which particular dynamical behaviors derive from specific gene regulatory structures poses a challenging question, at both scientific and application level, that necessarily requires computational tools to be answered. Herein, we discuss the algorithmic aspects and the implementation of a mathematical method, grounded on singular perturbation analysis, for the study of the dynamics of regulated gene networks. This results in a gene regulatory network simulator of the full range of possible dynamics of a specific class of ordinary differential equations adequate to model gene regulatory networks. The considered class of equations represent phenomenological models of the long interaction chains in a network: genes are the main players and the interactions between them are modeled by steep threshold-dependent response functions. The simulator we propose operates in the presence of incomplete knowledge of parameter values. It assumes that threshold-dependent regulation is modeled by continuous steep sigmoid functions, and each transcription factor only regulates one gene at each of its thresholds. Under these assumptions, the simulator derives sound predictions of the nonlinear and temporal multiscale dynamics of a gene regulatory network from an initial state and parameter space, symbolically described by inequalities between parameters. Beside its predictive soundness, it outperforms other qualitative simulators as for characterization of trajectories and possible calculation of the probability of occurrence of each behavior when parameters are assigned stochastic values.}}

However, functional studies of gap junctions are hampered by the unspecificity of pharmacological tools available. Here we have investigated gap-junctional coupling between CA3 pyramidal cells in neonatal hippocampus and its contribution to early network activity. Four different gap junction inhibitors, including the general blocker carbenoxolone, decreased the frequency of network activity bursts in CA3 area of hippocampus of P3-6 rats, suggesting the involvement of electrical connections in the generation of spontaneous network activity. In CA3 pyramidal cells, spikelets evoked by local stimulation of stratum oriens, were inhibited by carbenoxolone, but not by inhibitors of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission, signifying the presence of electrical connectivity through axo-axonic gap junctions. Carbenoxolone also decreased the success rate of firing antidromic action potentials in response to stimulation, and changed the pattern of spontaneous action potential firing of CA3 pyramidal cells. Altogether, these data suggest that electrical coupling of CA3 pyramidal cells contribute to the generation of the early network events in neonatal hippocampus by modulating their firing pattern and synchronization.}}

Participants (n = 193; 53% female; M age = 19.4 years, 62.1% European-American) provided friendship nominations at time 1 and two months later at time 2. At time 1, participants donated saliva before and after rehearsal (later assayed for C and T). Stochastic actor-based models revealed that individuals with higher C levels were less likely to maintain their social relationships and more likely to create new friendships. In contrast, individuals with higher T levels were more likely to maintain friendships and less likely to create new relationships. Findings suggest that individual differences in C and T are associated with the initiation and maintenance of friendships and have several noteworthy theoretical implications.}}

Here, users' mobile devices represent a natural bridge through which users process acquired information and perform actions. The sheer amount of data available in this context calls for novel, autonomous and lightweight data-filtering solutions, where only relevant information is finally presented to users. Moreover, in many real-world scenarios data is not categorised in predefined topics, but it is generally accompanied by semantic descriptions possibly describing users' interests. In these complex conditions, user devices should autonomously become aware not only of the existence of data in the network, but also of their semantic descriptions and correlations between them. To tackle these issues, we present a set of algorithms for knowledge and data dissemination in opportunistic networks, based on simple and very effective models (called cognitive heuristics) coming from cognitive sciences. We show how to exploit them to disseminate both semantic data and the corresponding data items. We provide a thorough performance analysis, under various different conditions comparing our results against non-cognitive solutions. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our solution towards a more effective semantic knowledge acquisition and representation, and a more tailored content acquisition.}}

The proposed prediction model improves the activation function of the neural network, and makes an approach on cross-correlations forecasting with the particular input and output variables. The empirical research is performed in testing the forecasting effect of the EBPNN model and a comparison to back propagation neural network (BPNN). The empirical results show that the EBPNN is advantageous in increasing the predicting precision.}}

Firstly, a sufficient admissibility criterion is presented to guarantee that the augmented fuzzy jump neural network without parameter uncertainties is stochastically finite-time bounded in a prescribed time interval. From the admissibility criterion obtained, a sufficient condition on stochastic finite-time boundedness is provided for the augmented fuzzy jump neural networks. Then, a sufficient criterion to design a finite-time fuzzy filter is presented with uncertain parameters and Markovian jumps for discrete time-delay fuzzy neural networks. Moreover, conditions on stochastic finite-time stability are also established for nominal and uncertain delayed fuzzy jump neural networks without the presence of external disturbance. All criteria obtained can be represented as the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.}}

In this paper, we investigate link removal as an intervention strategy and study the relative effectiveness of different link removal methods in minimizing the spread of infections in a network. With that in mind, we develop four connectivity-based network interdiction models and formulate these models as mixed integer linear programs. The first model minimizes the number of connections between infected and susceptible nodes; the second the number of susceptible nodes having one or more connections with infected nodes; the third the total number of paths between infected and susceptible nodes; and the fourth the total weight of the paths between infected and susceptible nodes. We also propose heuristic algorithms to solve the models. The network interdiction models act as link removal methods, i.e., each return a solution consisting of a set of links to remove in the network. We compare the effectiveness of these four methods with the effectiveness of an existing link removal method [25], a method based on link betweenness centrality [18], and random link removal method. Our results show that complete isolation of susceptible nodes from infected nodes is the most effective method in reducing the average number of new infections (reduce occurrence) under most scenarios, and the relative effectiveness of the complete isolation method increases with transmission probability. In contrast, removing the highest probability transmission paths is the most effective method in increasing the average time to infect half of the susceptible nodes (reduce speed) under most scenarios, and the relative effectiveness of this method decreases with transmission probability.}}

Compact regularization paths are obtained by approximate homotopy to make the solution tractable. In our experiments, cTVDBN structure discovery has successfully revealed the evolution of time-varying relationships in a ring road system, and provided insights for plausible road structure improvements from a traffic flow dataset.}}

With rational hypotheses and parameter design, meanwhile considering the deployment of low-carbon resources, a novel carbon tax-constrained city logistics distribution network planning model is proposed. The model is a bilinear non-convex mixed integer programming and is reduced to a pure linear mixed integer programming through proper linearization. To verify the effectiveness of the model, an empirical study is conducted on a city logistics operator in Beijing and the popular commercial optimization suite IBM ILOG CPLEX is adopted for optimization purpose. Through analysis of the optimization results and comparison with traditional optimization models, it is found that the proposed model can help the city logistics distribution operator save up to 9.2% of operational cost during a full service cycle, and meanwhile cut down its carbon dioxide discharge by around 54.5% or 2135 metric tons at most.}}

An accurate estimation of battery remaining capacity is crucial for optimization of the vehicle control, preventing battery from over-charging and over-discharging and ensuring the safety during its service life. The remaining capacity estimation of a battery includes the estimation of state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-energy (SOE). In this work, a probability based adaptive estimator is presented to obtain accurate and reliable estimation results for both SOC and SOE. For the SOC estimation, an n ordered RC equivalent circuit model is employed by combining an electrochemical model to obtain more accurate voltage prediction results. For the SOE estimation, a sliding window neural network model is proposed to investigate the relationship between the terminal voltage and the model inputs. To verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed model and estimation algorithm, experiments under different dynamic operation current profiles are performed on the commercial 1665130-type lithium-ion batteries. The results illustrate that accurate and robust estimation can be obtained by the proposed method.}}

The acupuncture sensation of Deqi is an important component of acupuncture, but the functional brain responses of Deqi have not been entirely supported by the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. The aims of this study were to test the conditions that would generate a Deqi sensation and to investigate the effect of Deqi and the response of acupuncture at different depths and intensities on brain fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Design/setting Healthy subjects (n = 16) completed two resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scans, once during shallow needling (2 mm) and once during deep needling (10–20 mm) pseudorandomly, at the acupoint BL40. Results When undergoing shallow needling, 16 subjects had a mild stabbing pain sensation, and no one had a composite Deqi sensation; when undergoing deep needling, 14 subjects had a composite Deqi sensation, and only 2 subjects had a sharp pain feeling. Composite deep needling of Deqi sensation modulated neural activity at multiple levels of the brain and cerebellum, decreased functional connectivity in the default mode networks (DMN) and the pain matrix networks, and increased connectivity in the right posterior cerebellar lobe, left parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, and supplementary motor area (P &lt; 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05). When subjects underwent shallow needling, the brain network increased functional connectivity in the right side (precentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, cerebellar tonsil) and both side thalami; moreover, the right side of the medial prefrontal cortex had a decreased functional connection (P &lt; 0.05, FDR &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The hemodynamic response of deep needling of Deqi sensation hypothesis whereby deep needing could affect a variety of deep tissues and never fibers was supported as acupuncture modulates the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network to produce its Deqi effects. The similarity of LPNN and DMN suggests that deep needing may mobilize an important intrinsic brain network for its multiple modulation effects.}}

Two kinds of general algebraic connectivity are introduced to respectively investigate the global consensus in strongly connected networks and a class of networks containing directed spanning trees. Sufficient conditions are derived to reach a global consensus based on algebraic graph, matrix theory, and Lyapunov control approach. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical results.}}

To show the usefulness of this approach in practice, we also carry out numerical simulations on some concrete complex networks. Our results are completely consistent with the previous conclusions derived by graph theory methods. Furthermore, we show that the first excited state appears always on the largest connected component of the network. The relationship between the first excited energy and the average shortest path length in networks is also discussed.}}

abstract = {AbstractPurpose The optimal management of rare tumours (i.e. from accurate diagnosis to management in reference centres) is a public health challenge. In 2009, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) identified and financially supported the two expert networks for pathological and clinical diagnosis and management of soft tissue tumours. Methods The activities of both networks were prospectively collected using a nationwide database (rreps.org). Data describing the diagnosis management of 863 successive cases of desmoids tumours (DT) were prospectively collected from 2010 to 2013 and analysed. Results The number of confirmed DT constantly improved from January 2010 to December 2013 (from 173 to 273 cases per year); the expected incidence ranged from 132 to 330 cases/year. The rate of cases diagnosed with core-needle biopsies and CTNNB1 mutational status analysis increased from 30.6 to 40.7% and from 87.8 to 94.1%, respectively. The mean delay for pathological diagnosis confirmation constantly decreased from 107 to 47 d. Among the 846 adult patients, 414 (48.9%) patients were treated by reference centres. The rate of patients managed by reference centres constantly increased with time from 36.9 to 49.5% since 2010. The median management time of the referral centres constantly decreased from 440 to 67 d. Conclusion The two expert networks worked synergistically and improved diagnosis modalities of rare desmoid tumours at a national level. The impact of management by expert networks on the outcome will be prospectively analysed in the future.}}

To date, little is known about the Cd-responsive regulatory network in root vegetable crops including radish. In this study, 31,015 unigenes representing 66,552 assembled unique transcripts were isolated from radish root under Cd stress based on de novo transcriptome assembly. In all, 1496 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) consisted of 3579 transcripts were identified from Cd-free (CK) and Cd-treated (Cd200) libraries. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the up- and down-regulated DEGs were predominately involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis as well as cysteine and methionine-related pathways, respectively. RT-qPCR showed that the expression profiles of DEGs were in consistent with results from RNA-Seq analysis. Several candidate genes encoding phytochelatin synthase (PCS), metallothioneins (MTs), glutathione (GSH), zinc iron permease (ZIPs) and ABC transporter were responsible for Cd uptake, accumulation, translocation and detoxification in radish. The schematic model of DEGs and microRNAs-involved in Cd-responsive regulatory network was proposed. This study represents a first comprehensive transcriptome-based characterization of Cd-responsive DEGs in radish. These results could provide fundamental insight into complex Cd-responsive regulatory networks and facilitate further genetic manipulation of Cd accumulation in root vegetable crops.}}

However, accumulating evidence suggests that the mechanical properties of the culture matrix can modulate important neuronal functions such as growth, extension, branching and activity. Here we designed robust and reproducible laminin-polylysine grid micropatterns on cell culture substrates that have similar biochemical properties but a 100-fold difference in Young's modulus to investigate the role of the matrix rigidity on the formation and activity of cortical neuronal networks. We found that cell bodies of primary cortical neurons gradually accumulate in circular islands, whereas axonal extensions spread on linear tracks to connect circular islands. Our findings indicate that migration of cortical neurons is enhanced on soft substrates, leading to a faster formation of neuronal networks. Furthermore, the pre-synaptic density was two times higher on stiff substrates and consistently the number of action potentials and miniature synaptic currents was enhanced on stiff substrates. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence to indicate that matrix stiffness is a key parameter to modulate the growth dynamics, synaptic density and electrophysiological activity of cortical neuronal networks, thus providing useful information on scaffold design for neural tissue engineering.}}

For this purpose, superficial velocity of water and oil and the inclination angles of the pipe were used as input parameters, while water holdup values of two-phase flow were used as output parameters in training and testing of the multi-layer, feed-forward, back-propagation neural networks. Experimental data (468 data points) were taken from literature and used for developing of the ANN model. The obtained results showed that the network predictions have very good agreement with the experimental water holdup data. The accuracy between the neural network predictions and experimental data was achieved with low average absolute percent error (AAPE) and high coefficient of determination (R2) for both training data (AAPE = 2.34% and R2 = 0.999) and testing data (AAPE = 2.89% and R2 = 0.997) sets.

An online sample of 109 Facebook users completed an internet version of the translated the scale from the USA, Germany, Turkey, and Canada. For the scale's structural validity, first and second order confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. Cronbach's Alpha coefficients (0.90) and item total correlations were calculated to investigate reliability of the scale. Through validity study it was proven that English version of the scale was consisted of five factors. But as a result of the second order confirmatory factor analysis, correlation between social influence variable and adoption variable was found to be insignificant. Therefore, two items included in the social influence factor were extracted from scale. The results indicated that the English version of the Social Networks Adoption Scale consisting of 19 items and 5 factors provided valid and reliable measures of social networks adoption.

Neither the original proposal nor the critic publications were completely aware of the established methodology for PCA anomaly detection, which by that time had been developed for more than three decades in the area of industrial monitoring and chemometrics as part of the Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) theory. In this paper, the main steps of the MSPC approach based on PCA are introduced; related networking literature is reviewed, highlighting some differences with MSPC and drawbacks in their approaches; and specificities and challenges in the application of MSPC to networking are analyzed. All of this is demonstrated through illustrative experimentation that supports our discussion and reasoning.}}

An additional aspect that should be considered is the role played by the pumping system. Pumping may contribute to about 10% of the total primary energy consumption, especially in large networks or when small temperature levels are applied. Furthermore, the increasing share of waste heat or renewable energy sources from distributed producers requires a flexible and efficient pumping system. A further aspect which pumping strategy should face is system operation when malfunctions in the plants, pumps or pipes occur. Optimization of the pumping system requires the use of detailed simulation tools, which may need significant computational resources, especially in the case of large networks. A reduced model, based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition combined with Radial basis functions (POD-RBF model) is proposed in this paper. This approach allows maintaining high level of accuracy despite reductions of more than 80% in the computational time. This make the approach effective tool for control strategy operations. An application to a large district heating network shows that reductions of about 20% in the pumping request and effective management of failures are possible.}}

Neuroimaging methods such as diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography, which probe the connectivity of neural networks, show significant promise. We present a machine learning approach to classify TBI participants primarily with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on altered structural connectivity patterns derived through the network based statistical analysis of structural connectomes generated from TBI and age-matched control groups. In this approach, higher order diffusion models were used to map white matter connections between 116 cortical and subcortical regions. Tracts between these regions were generated using probabilistic tracking and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) measures along these connections were encoded in the connectivity matrices. Network-based statistical analysis of the connectivity matrices was performed to identify the network differences between a representative subset of the two groups. The affected network connections provided the feature vectors for principal component analysis and subsequent classification by random forest. The validity of the approach was tested using data acquired from a total of 179 TBI patients and 146 controls participants. The analysis revealed altered connectivity within a number of intra- and inter-hemispheric white matter pathways associated with DAI, in consensus with existing literature. A mean classification accuracy of 68.16% ± 1.81% and mean sensitivity of 80.0% ± 2.36% were achieved in correctly classifying the TBI patients evaluated on the subset of the participants that was not used for the statistical analysis, in a 10-fold cross-validation framework. These results highlight the potential for statistical machine learning approaches applied to structural connectomes to identify patients with diffusive axonal injury.}}

The motivation for the work is in the specific shortcomings of the conventional intra-domain IP routing principles such as "shortest-path" and "best-effort" when applied in IP ANs. We generalize these networks as the transit between the access routers and gateway and they range from a simple tree to meshed tree topologies. The method uses Multi-Topology OSPF standardized by the IETF and instantiates multiple OSPF installations in networks, each installation utilizing a portion of the topology in the conventional manner, i.e. routing plane (RP). Hence, all links are utilized by having at least one standard OSPF routing installation including them in the paths between access router and gateway. The method functions on extensions in routers and simple packet tagging allowing the routers to install and separate between paths of each RP. Routing is facilitated by the proposed method's algorithms for network planning and traffic engineering. The former is called the offline algorithm rendering the optimum number of RPs in an arbitrary topology by independently setting link weights for each plane. The latter is called the online algorithm that applies a policy-based routing scheme for dynamically selecting the best RP based on the introduced QoS-aware cost function. The paper concludes by significant improvements in throughput, packet loss rate, session blocking and delays for numerous cases of topologies differing in numbers of networks nodes and degrees of meshing.}}

Meanwhile, a pinning scheme deciding which nodes need to be pinned and a simply approximate formula for estimating the least number of pinned nodes are also provided. By introducing impulsive effects to the open-loop controlled network, another synchronization scheme is developed for the network with nonidentical time-delayed dynamical nodes, and an estimate of the upper bound of impulsive intervals ensuring global exponential stability of the synchronization process is also given.

Here, we consider a continuous-state susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) model as an ideal limit-case of diffusion processes of fragmentary information on networks, where individuals possess fractions of the information content and update them by selectively exchanging messages with partners in the vicinity. Specifically, we incorporate local information, such as neighbors' node degrees and carried contents, into the individual partner choice, and examine the roles of a variety of such strategies in the information diffusion process, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our method provides an effective and flexible route of modulating continuous-state diffusion dynamics on networks and has potential in a wide array of practical applications.}}

A novel method is proposed and formulated as a tractable mixed integer linear programming optimization problem whose objective is to find hourly sale prices offered to customers, transactions (purchase/sale) with the wholesale market, commitment of distribution generation units, dispatch of battery energy storage systems and planning of interruptible loads in a way that the profit of the distribution network operator is maximized while customers' benefit is guaranteed. To hedge distribution network operator against financial risk arising from uncertainty of wholesale market prices, a risk management model based on a bi-level information-gap decision theory is proposed. The proposed bi-level problem is solved by recasting it into its equivalent single-level robust optimization problem using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. Performance of the proposed model is verified by applying it to a modified version of the IEEE 33-bus distribution test network. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.}}

However, evidence from structural plasticity studies remains mixed and the neural correlates of learning and practice are still poorly understood. We conducted a robustly designed study into grey matter plasticity following 2 months of working memory training. We generated a priori hypotheses regarding the location of plastic effects across three cognitive control networks (executive, anterior salience and basal ganglia networks), and compared the effects of adaptive training (n = 20) with a well-matched active control group (n = 20) which differed in training complexity and included extensive cognitive assessment before and after the training. Adaptive training relative to control activities resulted in a complex pattern of subtle and localised structural changes: Training was associated with increases in cortical thickness in right-lateralised executive regions, notably the right caudal middle frontal cortex, as well as increases in the volume of the left pallidum. In addition the training group showed reductions of thickness in the right insula, which were correlated with training-induced improvements in backward digit span performance. Unexpectedly, control activities were associated with reductions in thickness in the right pars triangularis. These results suggest that the direction of activity-induced plastic changes depend on the level of training complexity as well as brain location. These observations are consistent with the view that the brain responds dynamically to environmental demands by focusing resources on task relevant networks and eliminating irrelevant processing for the purpose of energy reduction.}}

Because of this ambiguity, autophagy is considered as a double-edged sword in oncology, making anti-cancer therapeutic approaches highly challenging. In this review, we present how systems-level knowledge on autophagy regulation can help to develop new strategies and efficiently select novel anti-cancer drug targets. We focus on the protein interactors and transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulators of autophagy as the protein and regulatory networks significantly influence the activity of core autophagy proteins during tumor progression. We list several network resources to identify interactors and regulators of autophagy proteins. As in silico analysis of such networks often necessitates experimental validation, we briefly summarize tractable model organisms to examine the role of autophagy in cancer. We also discuss fluorescence techniques for high-throughput monitoring of autophagy in humans. Finally, the challenges of pharmacological modulation of autophagy are reviewed. We suggest network-based concepts to overcome these difficulties. We point out that a context-dependent modulation of autophagy would be favored in anti-cancer therapy, where autophagy is stimulated in normal cells, while inhibited only in stressed cancer cells. To achieve this goal, we introduce the concept of regulo-network drugs targeting specific transcription factors or miRNA families identified with network analysis. The effect of regulo-network drugs propagates indirectly through transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of autophagy proteins, and, as a multi-directional intervention tool, they can both activate and inhibit specific proteins in the same time. The future identification and validation of such regulo-network drug targets may serve as novel intervention points, where autophagy can be effectively modulated in cancer therapy.}}

Advantages of the ANN technique over more traditional mathematical models are twofold: on one hand, this approach deals quite naturally with a large number of parameters/variables, and also allows to identify those variables which do not play a crucial role in the system dynamics; on the other hand, the implemented ANN can be more easily used by a staff of non-mathematicians in the unit, as an on-site predictive tool. As such, the ANN model is particularly suitable for the case study. The predictions from the ANN technique are then compared and contrasted with those obtained from a generalized kinetic approach previously proposed and tested by the authors. The comparison on the two case periods shows the ANN predictions to be somewhat closer to the experimental values. However, the mean deviations and the analysis of the statistical coefficients over a span of multiple years suggest the kinetic model to be more reliable in the long run, i.e., its predictions can be considered as acceptable even on periods that are quite far away from the two case periods over which the many parameters of the model had been optimized. The approach under study, referring to paradigms and methods of physical and mathematical models integrated with psychosocial sciences, has good chances of gaining the attention of the scientific community in both areas, and hence of eventually obtaining wider diffusion and generalization.}}

This paper presents a coordinated hierarchical controls selection method for mitigating the overvoltage problem using available resources in DNs, for example, static synchronous compensators (STATCOM) and battery energy storage (BES) systems. The proposed method recommends the installation of new control devices, such as photovoltaic (PV) smart voltage source inverter (VSI) with reactive power compensation capability, residential BES installations, and power sharing among neighboring distributed generator (DG) units depending on PV penetration levels at the LV network. The requirements of the proposed installation of the compensation devices are based on three criteria: (i) higher PV penetration scenarios; (ii) satisfying relevant standards; and (iii) economic perspectives. The interactions among standard VSI (operated at unity power factor (pf)) and smart VSI (variable pf) are also considered in the proposed method to mitigate the voltage rise problems. The results show that only after exceeding certain PV penetrations, the LV network requires a coordinated operation from STATCOM/BES and advanced compensation devices to sustain terminal voltages within permissible (±6%) limits. The proposed method is verified with extensive case studies utilizing real PV irradiance and customer loads data with nonlinear dynamic DER models connected with an urban LV network in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.}}

Two different perspectives are studied, i.e., that of the transportation agency and that of the household. These perspectives are linked through intermediate outputs and carry-overs generated by the underlying processes associated with each perspective. Within this context, we propose a theoretical representation of a slacks-based dynamic network DEA approach for measuring evacuation performance when a ramp closure evacuation traffic management strategy is considered. This representation requires a theoretical yet tractable conceptual framework that incorporates stakeholder perspectives, evacuation-related systems, processes and their interdependencies. This research combines the dynamic network DEA approach with traffic engineering and socio-behavioral theory of protective action. An initial exploration of the proposed approach allows for the discovery of efficiency interdependencies among perspectives, which in turn provides useful information and insights for the future design of holistic evacuation traffic management strategies.}}

In this paper, we propose a novel statistical model based on dynamic bayesian network, namely Multi-Topic Tracking Model for Dynamic Social Network (MTTD). It takes influence phenomenon, selection phenomenon, document generative process and the evolution of textual topics into account. Specifically, in our MTTD model, Gibbs Random Field is defined to model the influence of historical status of users in the network and the interdependency between them in order to consider the influence phenomenon. To address the selection phenomenon, a stochastic block model is used to model the link generation process based on the users' interests to topics. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) is used to describe the document generative process according to the users' interests. Finally, the dependence on the historical topic status is also considered to ensure the continuity of the topic itself in topic evolution model. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to estimate parameters in the proposed MTTD model. Empirical experiments on real datasets show that the MTTD model performs better than Popular Event Tracking (PET) and Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) in generalization performance, topic interpretability performance, topic content evolution and topic popularity evolution performance.}}

This model involves the collaboration of different organizations and decentralized decision making to improve the overall performance of a supply-chain network. The current research on collaborative decision making lacks a clear and effective decision system, which leads to a series of problems, such as unclear decision positioning, vague decision processes and poor operability of decision solutions. To solve these problems, this paper studies the principles of inter-organizational collaboration and proposes a novel perspective for collaborative decision making based on material, information and time flows. A flow-based three-dimensional collaborative decision-making model for supply-chain networks is creatively advanced in this paper. The model is an efficient methodological tool for collaboration management in the following ways: (i) it clarifies both the domain and the space of collaborative decision making; (ii) it sets up mapping relationships of decision spaces in different decision domains and elaborates their formal descriptions systematically; (iii) it solves the issues related to the association and integration of inter-organizational collaboration in several decision domains; and (iv) it allows all members in all organizations to be involved in the decision making of a supply-chain network. A case is studied to elaborate and verify the efficiency of the collaborative decision-making model. Compared with previous collaborative decision-making research, this paper provides a more efficient solution for collaborative decision making. The outlined model has clearer decision-making positioning and a stronger actual operability, and it provides an effective methodological reference for operating the inter-organizational collaborative decision making of a supply-chain network.}}

The structure of copolymer is compared to "fishing net" in order to increase the contact between cells and substrates. The application of poly (amidoamine) dendrimers provides abundant amino groups to react with APBA which is just like "baits" that can bond with sialic acid in the cytomembrane to realize cell capture. The 3D network structure trammels cancer cells, offers great reaction space and displays hydrophilic surface, which has immensely improved the contact probability of cells and materials. Due to the 3D network structure and dendrimer, this material can achieve a high capture efficiency of 87±5% in 45 min. The viability of captured cells is nearly 100%, as a result of the soft and hydrophilic surface and hypotoxicity of this copolymer.}}

Considering the characteristics of the distributed power supply and micro-grid, and giving full play to the advantages of distributed generation technology in the economic, environmental and energy aspects, this paper highlights an environmental protection and energy saving optimal schedule model for ADN. The scheduling model focuses on the minimum network loss, minimum voltage deviation and minimum difference between peak and valley load. In addition, the two stage algorithm is presented to solve the proposed multi-objective scheduling model of ADN. First, a set of Pareto solutions are obtained by using the proposed particle swarm optimization combined with bacterial foraging algorithm (PSO-BFO) to solve multi-objective optimization problems, then the optimal schedule strategy of ADN is gained through evaluating the Pareto solutions with entropy weight decision-making method. To avoid the search falling into local optimal solution, the two-value crossover operator is introduced to exchange the information among subpopulations and update the position of related particles. Meanwhile, the adaptive adjusting inertia constant strategy is used to improve the algorithm convergence speed. Finally, the case study results demonstrate the rationality of the proposed optimal schedule model and the validity of its solution algorithm for ADN.}}

This has limited scholarly knowledge about the development and effects of cultural resources. This paper draws on original survey data to investigate the foundation of individual cultural repertoire diversity. Using a novel, empirically-grounded measure of the variety of interpretive frames known by expectant mothers, I ask (a) whether more privileged respondents "consume" a wider variety of cultural resources than do less privileged individuals, as has been the pattern for the consumption of cultural products like music; and (b) whether this consumption is related to respondents' social network characteristics, as literature from select sociological subfields would suggest. I find that educational attainment and social network diversity independently predict repertoire diversity, and that these effects are each moderated by the respondent's status as a new or experienced mother. These analyses reveal a new way in which human and social capital confer cultural resources, while also suggesting that institutional effects and social network resources may reduce such disparities. The survey instrument presented here overcomes a long-standing methodological barrier to studying individual cultural repertoires and can be modified to use in other empirical contexts.}}

A bridge system is broken down into its constitutive components to isolate specific failure mechanisms and damage states at the component level. At the system level, the probability of occurrence of failure modes (i.e. various configurations of component damage states) is estimated thanks to a Bayesian analysis. These system fragility functions can then be directly related to harmonized functionality levels in order to get accurate predictions of downtime or traffic reduction. The applicability of the Bayesian Network formulation is compared to the matrix-based system reliability method, in terms of accuracy and computation time, while modeling strategies are proposed in the case of large systems with complex failure modes or multi-state components. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a bridge system that is exposed to multiple hazard events (earthquakes, ground failures and floods): using the Bayesian framework, four functionality loss levels can be predicted with fragility surfaces that are expressed as a function of peak ground acceleration and flow discharge, taking into account multi-hazard interactions at the vulnerability level (i.e. cumulated damage events).}}

Few graph layout methods capture this structure well which limits their effectiveness and the utility of the visualization itself. Here we present an extension to our novel graphTPP layout method for laying out small-world networks using only their topological properties rather than their node attributes. The Watts–Strogatz model is used to generate a variety of graphs with a small-world network structure. Community detection algorithms are used to generate six different clusterings of the data. These clusterings, the adjacency matrix and edgelist are loaded into graphTPP and, through user interaction combined with linear projections of the adjacency matrix, graphTPP is able to produce a layout which visually separates these clusters. These layouts are compared to the layouts of two force-based techniques. graphTPP is able to clearly separate each of the communities into a spatially distinct area and the edge relationships between the clusters show the strength of their relationship. As a secondary contribution, an edge-grouping algorithm for graphTPP is demonstrated as a means to reduce visual clutter in the layout and reinforce the display of the strength of the relationship between two communities.}}

Scale-free networks are characterized by a "fat-tail" degree distribution with considerably higher presence of so called hubs – nodes with very high degree. To understand and predict very large networks it is important to study the possibility of parallel simulation. We consider a class of stochastic processes which keeps the number of edges in the network constant called equilibrium networks. This class is characterized by a preferential selection where the edge destinations are chosen according to a preferential function f(k) which depends on the node degree k. For this class of stochastic processes we prove that it is difficult if not impossible to design an exact parallel algorithm if the function f(k) is monotonous with an injective derivative. However, in the important case where f(k) is linear we present a fully scalable algorithm with almost linear speedup. The experimental results confirm the linear scalability on a large processor cluster.}}

abstract = {Abstract A greener and efficient alkene epoxidation process using heterogeneous molybdenum (Mo) based catalysts and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant has been developed. A polybenzimidazole supported Mo(VI) complex, i.e. PBI.Mo and polystyrene 2-(aminomethyl) pyridine supported Mo(VI) complex, i.e. Ps.AMP.Mo catalysts have been successfully prepared and characterised. The catalytic activities of the polymer supported Mo(VI) catalysts have been tested for epoxidation of 1-hexene and 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene in a jacketed stirred batch reactor. Batch experiments have been conducted to study the effect of different types of catalysts, catalyst loading, feed mole ratio (FMR) of alkene to TBHP and reaction temperature on the yield of epoxide for both alkenes, i.e. 1-hexene and 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene. The long-term stability of PBI.Mo and Ps.AMP.Mo catalysts has been evaluated by recycling the catalyst several times for batch experiments using conditions that will form the basis of a continuous epoxidation process. The extent of Mo leaching from each polymer supported catalyst has been investigated by isolating any residue from reaction supernatant solutions after the removal of the heterogeneous catalyst and using the residue as potential catalyst for epoxidation. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been employed to predict the catalytic performance of PBI.Mo and Ps.AMP.Mo catalysts for all batch experimental results. The ANN predicted values are in good agreement with the batch experimental results. The results obtained from batch experiments and ANN modelling provided useful information for conducting continuous epoxidation experiments in multi-functional reactors such as FlowSyn and reactive distillation column (RDC).}}

Here, a Bayesian Network approach is used to evaluate effects that anthropogenic and climate change disturbances have on coral reef structure. The network was constructed on knowledge derived from the literature and elicited from experts, and parameterised on independent data. Evaluation of the model was conducted through sensitivity analyses and data integration was fundamental to obtain a balanced dataset. Scenario analyses, conducted to assess the effects of stressors on the reef framework state, suggested that calcifying organisms and carbonate production, rather than bioerosion, had the largest influence on the reef carbonate budgetary state. Despite the overall budget remaining positive, anthropogenic pressures, particularly deterioration of water quality, affected reef carbonate production, representing a warning signal for potential changes in the reef state.}}

abstract = {Abstract Dynamic model is an important issue for research on stability, dynamic characteristics, surge and control technique of axial-flow pumping system, and such a model is usually characterized by complex nonlinearity, strong coupling and time-varying mathematical equation. For the convenience of establishing model and highly effective computing, dynamic characteristics of the whole system are divided into four parts: pump lift-flow characteristics, pipeline characteristics, mechanical characteristics of asynchronous motor and torque characteristics of pump load. Each part is a nonlinear subsystem, and there are complex coupling relations among each other. In the paper, each part of the pump system is modeled respectively by mechanisms of hydrodynamics, transmission dynamics, electromechanics and affinity law. Considering that the axial-flow pump is characterized by nonlinearity and parameters are difficultly estimated in the low flow operation area and that the data of pump head-flow can be easily tested under the speed of power frequency, a modeling method combined with the RBF neural network is proposed, where hidden layer parameters are optimized by K means clustering algorithm, and the weights are trained by least square method. At last the whole simulation model of the axial-flow pumping system is set up, and the validity of the proposed modeling method is verified through simulation.}}

Specifically, we combine machine learning-based textual analysis with social network analysis to examine the structure and content of the discussion network which formed around the political aspects of food safety issues on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The findings suggest that Weibo-mediated communication space does not serve as an effective forum for deliberative discussion because people of like mind tend to cluster and the factor of emotion predominates. Further statistical analyses of a hand-coded sample show that emotional discussions influence people more than cognitive discussions, with distinct emotions (e.g., anger, fear and sadness) having different effects. A poster's status is also found to matter. We contend that this kind of online civic talk underlines an expressive form of rationality that transcends the dominant bipolar instrumental-communicative dimension for understanding the use of social media in online political discussion.}}

abstract = {Abstract The rheology of F-actin networks has attracted a great attention during the last years. In order to gain a complete understanding of the rheological properties of these novel materials, it is necessary the study in a large deformations regime to alter their internal structure. In this sense, Schmoller et al. (2010) showed that the reconstituted networks of F-actin crosslinked with alpha-actinin unexpectedly harden when they are subjected to a cyclical shear. This observation contradicts the expected Mullins effect observed in most soft materials, such as rubber and living tissues, where a pronounced softening is observed when they are cyclically deformed. We think that the key to understand this stunning effect is the gelation process. To define it, the most relevant constituents are the chemical crosslinks – alpha-actinin –, the physical crosslinks – introduced by the entanglement of the semiflexible network – and the interaction between them. As a consequence of this interaction, a pre-stressed network emerges and introduces a feedback effect, where the pre-stress also regulates the adhesion energy of the alpha-actinin, setting the structure in a metastable reference configuration. Therefore, the external loads and the evolvement of the trapped stress drive the microstructural changes during the cyclic loading protocol. In this work, we propose a micromechanical model into the framework of nonlinear continuum mechanics. The mechanics of the F-actin filaments is modelled using the wormlike chain model for semiflexible filaments and the gelation process is modelled as mesoscale dynamics for the alpha-actinin and physical crosslink. The model has been validated with reported experimental results.}}

abstract = {Abstract Distribution network expansion planning (DNEP) is becoming more complex in nature. Addition of new load centers, due to increasing conversion of greenfield areas into habitats, have generated need of more intense and highly structured planning strategies. Micro level work on distribution expansion planning has been ignored by most of the researchers mainly in Indian scenario. Since practical distribution networks are quite large, number of candidates (load centers) will be more and, hence, number of variables (electrical parameters and new load center feasible connections with the existing system) are remarkable. Optimizing a large system may result in significant decrease of accuracy and increase of computation time. For deciphering this issue, segmentation procedure has been applicable. For this purpose, a sensitivity analysis has been applied to find dependent variables. It is obvious that a correct segmentation can decrease computation time (as a single task is operated in segments simultaneously) while accuracy decreases negligibly. In present work, a scheme has been introduced to connect three greenfield load centers with existing primary distribution system by using hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA). HGA is an integrated approach of analytical hierarchical process and genetic algorithm. The paper reports best selection of investment with finest voltage profile and least losses while maintaining radiality of the system. DNEP has been done at micro level and proposed methodology has been tested on a small dimension practical distribution system. The novelty of this paper is to optimize the best possible selection of connection of new load centers with existing system with the help of AHP and GA and results have been verified with advance optimal tool multiple criteria data envelopment analysis (MCDEA). HGA and MCDEA are applied to practical nine bus distribution system and the results are presented and compared.}}

This problem arises in many contexts (e.g. transportation, energy generation, etc.). A general networks slacks-based inefficiency (GNSBI) measure can be computed using a simple linear program that takes into account the weak disposability of the bad outputs. The slacks-based inefficiency (SBI) of each process is also calculated. Target values for all inputs, outputs (both desirable and undesirable) and even intermediate products are also provided. The proposed approach is rather general and can accommodate many different network topologies and returns to scale assumptions. Two applications to the banking sector are presented: one to assess banks efficiencies and another to assess bank branches.}}

abstract = {Abstract Large scale multi-domain software-defined optical networks (SDON) provisioning has become a key area with increased scalable bandwidth services across wider network regions. Although distributed schemes could achieve lightpath routing by the ergodic process of domain boundary nodes, it increases the complexity of the signaling procedure and deployment of the interface. Moreover, the physical impairments are always the main factor of the infrastructure layer in SDON, which affect the transmission quality of the signal. Meanwhile, with increasing energy consumption of the Internet, it is imperative to design energy-efficient networks. To address the above issues, in this paper, an intelligent inter-domain routing scheme, which is supported by hierarchical control plane architecture, is presented based on sub-topology graph under the consideration of diffserv quality-of-service (QoS) and energy saving. The proposed scheme could achieve multi-domain quality of transmission (QoT), energy aware routing and spectrum assignment (RSA). We explore the scenarios where the multi-domain SDON achieve energy efficiency on the basis of meeting the QoT requirement. The blocking, energy consumption and average set up delay performances of the proposed schemes are estimated. The results indicate that the introduction of sub-topology in multi-domain RSA scheme has the better performance comparing with the distributed scheme.}}
